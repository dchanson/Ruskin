                <p>Item, that the postillion, be permitted, when

                <p>Alas, every article of this treaty was strictly ful&#x2013;
                    <lb/>filled with regard to us, and the consequence was,
                    <lb/>that in a six hours ride of twelve miles, I was

                <p>A cathedral is a noble, a beautiful, a sublime
                    <lb/>thing, by twilight, with its white, fretted, mar
                    <lb/>ble columns, looking out from the dark retiring
                    <lb/>immensity, of the long aisles, and the faint
                    <lb/>streams of coloured and variegated light, fal&#x2013;
                    <lb/>ling faintly through the Gothic windows,
                    <lb/>streaming at intervals along the chequered
                    <lb/>floors or ruddily lighting up the countenan&#x2013;
                    <lb/>ces, of the marble figures, giving a ghastly re

                <pb facs="MSIX30v"/>
                    <lb/>makes you start when you look upon the hollow
                    <lb/>eyes, and rigid muscles starting out of the stone
                    <lb/>You almost think that the dead forms of depar

                    <lb/>as a mediator. Very ancient affair, product of
                    <lb/>the dark ages I suppose, His sarcophagus al&#x2013;
