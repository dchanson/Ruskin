                <p><placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> is a lovely, a queenlike city, from
                    <lb/>a distance, sweeping up the flanks of its
                    <lb/>hill, battlement over battlement swell&#x2013;
                    <lb/>ing up higher, and higher, and yet higher
                    <lb/>and the massive obscurity of the two huge
                    <lb/>square cathedral tow&#x02BC;rs looming over the
                    <lb/>whole, and contrasted strangely with the
                    <lb/>delicate sharp spiriness of the steeple of
                    <lb/>the hotel de ville. <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName> would look like
                    <lb/>an assemblage of brick kilns beside it.
                    <lb/>We saw <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> at eleven miles distance
                    <lb/>its towers rising dark and spearlike out
                <pb facs="MSIX23v"/>
                    <lb/>of the horizon. It was waxing dark as we
                    <lb/>entered the city, and the lights began to
                    <lb/>twinkle in the few, the very few shop win
                    <lb/>dows. I love to pass through a city at night
                    <lb/>the hum of the voices rises so softly out of
                    <lb/>the obscurity, and the figures flit about
                    <lb/>dark and batlike, and the cold starlight
                    <lb/>mingles so strangely withe the red swar
                    <lb/>thy gleam of the lamps, and when you 
                    <lb/>look up, the narrow strip of sky is of
                    <lb/>such a dark dark blue, you may see 
                    <lb/>it appear to quiver with the starlight 
                    <lb/>if you look long, and the white house 
                    <lb/>fronts rise so ghostly, so ghostlike agains 
                    <lb/>it and the windows seem grinning ma&#x2013;
                    <lb/>liciously askance at you. It makes one 
                    <lb/>shiver to think of it. Cities are exceed&#x2013;
                    <lb/>ingly picturesque when built upon hills 
                    <lb/>but for exploring for circumnavigating for 
                    <lb/>perambulating&#x2014; Oh woe to the walker 
                    <lb/>who is compelled to drag himself up
                <pb facs="MSIX24r"/>
                    <lb/>their steeps, those tiresome paved steeps,
                    <lb/>those hard unyielding provokingly smooth
                    <lb/>flagstones;or to go thundering down,
                    <lb/>his rapidity increasing every instant
                    <lb/>when he is once in for it, lurching
                    <lb/>tremendously like a ship in a swell,
                    <lb/>jerk, jerk, jerking, &#x2014; Oh facilis des&#x2013;
                    <lb/>census Averni, sed; Ay theres the rub.
                    <lb/>The hotel de Bellevue at <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> ought
                    <lb/>to have a belle vue, for you might as
                    <lb/>well scale the crags of <placeName corresp="#GIBRALTAR">Gibraltar,</placeName> as storm
                    <lb/>the heights of the hotel de belle vue&#x2014;;
                    <lb/>whence, for all the boast of its title, I
                    <lb/>never could discover more belle vue, than
                    <lb/>a dusty square, some formal houses, &#x0026;
                    <lb/>a few murky park trees.
                </p>
                <p>We left <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> on Wednesday mor&#x2013;
                    <lb/>ning for <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo,</placeName> the sun beamed
                    <lb/>sweetly among the long trunk of the
                    <lb/>aged trees of the forest of <placeName corresp="#LOIGNY">Loigny;</placeName> and&#x2014;
                    <lb/>their damp bark glistened dewily, &#x2014; as
                <pb facs="MSIX24v"/>
                    <lb/>it rose up taller, and taller, branching off
                    <lb/>into the bending boughs, and slender spray
                    <lb/>with the delicate foliage scattered through
                    <lb/>here every leaf defined separately and clear
                    <lb/>ly, as you looked up to the broad sky there
                    <lb/>in light spready masses partially con&#x2013;
                    <lb/>cealing the long tapery grey trunks which
                    <lb/>which retired back, farther and still far&#x2013;
                    <lb/>ther, yet distinctly grouped, and those 
                    <lb/>groups seperated by the gleamy stream
                    <lb/>of yellow sunshine, which shone full&#x2013;
                    <lb/>on the sides of the swelling green grassy
                    <lb/>banks, then broken by the intervening
                    <lb/>hollows, then climbing again up the
                    <lb/>dewy moss and white trunks. It was
                    <lb/>exceeding beautiful, I could have fan&#x2013;
                    <lb/>cied the glister of the bright bayonets
                    <lb/>changing, like starlight on a wavy o&#x2013;
                    <lb/>cean, among the retiring foilage of
                    <lb/>those ancient trees, &#x2014; I forgot how many
                    <lb/>long years had past by since that ev&#x2013;

                    <lb/>entful day. &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A; This is the field of <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo.</placeName>
                    <lb/>The round hills of green pasture lay unbro
                    <lb/>ken before me, without a single tree except
                    <lb/>where far to the right the rich forest coun
                    <lb/>try commenced again, breaking away in
                    <lb/>rounded masses, till lost in the blue of
                    <lb/>the faint horizon. All is peace now.
                    <lb/>Englishmen may feel proud on the field
                    <lb/>of <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo,</placeName> perhaps I did, but there is
                    <lb/>something mingled with it. &#x2014; Poor
