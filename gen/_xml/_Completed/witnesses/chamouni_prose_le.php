         <div class="p">And this is our last excursion on <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Swiss</span> ground, thought I, scanning<br/>
                    the provoking clouds that ever rolled massively among the regions of<br/>
                    eternal snow, though far above the blue mountains that encircle their<br/>
                    mighty monarch.<span class="gloss-inline">

                </span>
              </a></span> I have always a sort of kindred feeling for these<br/>
                    beautiful blue hills; they ever look half <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">English</span>, and I love them for it.<br/>
                    They may not be so wonderful, so majestic, so mighty, or so beautiful, but<br/><div id="" class="pb"></div>
                    they are more like home, sweet home, and it is pleasant, very pleasant, to<br/>
                    meet a friend in a foreign land. We are going to <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</span>, <i>cʼest vrai</i>,<br/>
                    but it seems exceeding strange. Before we left home, I had read of<br/>
            <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</span>, heard of <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</span>, and seen some few drawings of <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</span>,<br/>
                    but never so much as dreamed of going to <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</span>, it seemed so un‐<br/>
                    come‐at‐able; and for the <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span>, it seemed in another world, in fairy‐<br/>
                    land, and of course had a magic halo thrown round it, an ætherialness<br/>
                    that can never be joined with reality. That halo comes again on looking<br/>
                    back. And this is our last excursion on <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Swiss</span> ground, thought I, the<br/>
                    last, and the wildest, and the sweetest, because—because, perhaps it is<br/>
                    the last. The day was exceedingly favourable for the scenery of the<br/>
                    lower mountains, not for the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>; they were reserved for other times.<br/>
                    The noon verged gradually from burning sunshine<span class="gloss-inline">

                    clouds, that rolled rapidly over the murky heaven as we entered a solitary<br/>
                    mountain recess, a cliffy defile, leading from the valley of <span class="placeName-MAGLAND">Maglan</span> to that<br/>

              </a></span> Down they burst with a fierce rattling turmoil and headlong<br/>
                    flash, flash, flashing, and the bridleless clouds careered along the crags at<br/>
                    such a wild rate that their own speed broke them into scattered confusion,<br/>
                    that the blue sky shone calmly through their openings, and the labouring<br/>
                    sun struggled strangely—now gleaming waterily on the red‐ribbed skeleton<br/>
                    crags, now mingling with the quiver of the lightning, now again plunged<br/>
                    into the swift rack of the thunder‐clouds that seemed sweeping round the<br/>
                    mountain summits like lashed ocean waves round a labouring vessel. The<br/>
            <span class="geogName-ARVE">Arve</span> swelled on the instant, and his turbid waves tore madly down, trees,<br/>
                    stones, rocks, all tost along the channel, by the arrowy force of that<br/>
                    resistless river, ever mighty, but now fearful. As the sun verged towards<br/>
                    the horizon, the clouds swept partially away; the hills, the cliffs, the<br/>
                    mountains, the rocks, and the blue vaulted sky glowed with his last rays<br/>
                    for a moment; he sunk and the night came, his darkness made yet more<br/>
                    visible by the thunder gloom of the storm.</div>
         
         
         <div class="p">“Voilà les aiguilles,” quoth our char‐à‐banc driver. If any person in<br/>
                    the whole world is totally insensible to pain, knocks, aches, and bruises, it<br/>
                    must be a <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Swiss</span> char‐à‐banc driver. The <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Swiss</span> char‐à‐banc is a vehicle<br/>
                    expressly built for the purpose of passing over those roads, which no<br/>
                    other species of conveyance can pass over twelve yards of without immediate<br/>
                    demolition. It is a sort of large side‐saddle, capable of containing, if<br/>
                    well packed, three pauvres miserables, with a back and roof to it, and a<br/>
                    board to put the feet on, with a leather to keep you in, all which are of<br/>
                    a most ancient and venerable description; this is fixed totally without<br/>
                    springs or anything of the kind, as far as I could see, upon four wheels,<br/>
                    et voilà un char‐à‐banc. With this kind of vehicle, upon roads which<br/>
                    always resemble and are often carried through the beds of tumbling<br/>
                    mountain torrents, any one may easily imagine the sort of pleasurable<br/>
                    penance to which he is subjected who submits to be driven from <span class="placeName-SALLANCHES">Salenches</span><br/>
                    up to <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</span> in a char‐à‐banc.</div>

              </a></span> How I started,<br/>
                    I believe I was dreaming of home at the time; it is odd you always think<br/><div id="" class="pb"></div>
                    it would be very pleasant to be where you are not; it canʼt be helped, but<br/>
                    it is very provoking, the charms of a place always increase in geometrical<br/>
                    ratio as you get farther from it, and therefore ʼtis a rich pleasure to look<br/>
                    back on anything, though it has a dash of regret. It is singular that<br/>
                    almost all pleasure is past, or coming. Well, I looked up, and lo! seven<br/>
                    thousand feet above me soared the needles of <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span>, splintered and<br/>
                    crashed and shivered, the marks of the tempest for three score centuries,<br/>
                    yet they are here, shooting up red, bare, scarcely even lichened, entirely<br/>
                    inaccessible, snowless, the very snow cannot cling to the down‐plunging<br/>
                    sheerness of these terrific flanks that rise pre‐eminently dizzying and<br/>
                    beetling above the sea of wreathed snow that rolled its long surging waves<br/>
                    over the summits of the lower and less precipitous mountains. Then came<br/>
                    the stretching gloominess of the pine forests, jagging darkly upon the<br/>
                    ridge of every crag, strangely contrasted with the cold blueness of the<br/>
                    peaky glaciers that filled the huge ravines between the hills, descending<br/>
                    like the bursting billows of a chafed ocean tide from the desolate dominion<br/>
                    of the snow, and curling forward till they lay on the green fields of<br/>
            <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</span>, which stretched away, one unbroken line of luxuriance, till<br/>
                    bounded by the lonely desertness of the <span class="placeName-COLDEBALME">Col de Balme</span>.<span class="gloss-inline">

                    another scene like <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</span> throughout all <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span>. In no other<br/>
                    spot that I have seen is the rich luxuriance of the cultivated valley, the<br/>
                    flashing splendour of the eternal snow, the impending magnificence of the<br/>
                    bare, spiry crag, and the strange, cold rigidity of the surgy glaciers so<br/>
                    dreadfully and beautifully combined, There is silence unbroken, no<br/>
                    thunder of the avalanche comes crashing from the recesses of the hills,<br/>
                    there is no voice from the chasmy glacier, no murmur from the thousand<br/>
                    mountain streams, you are in solitude, a strange unearthly solitude, but<br/>
                    you feel as if the air were full of spirits.<span class="gloss-inline">
