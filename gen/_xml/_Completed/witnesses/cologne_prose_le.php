                    in his most sacred subjects, magnificent as they are viewed as paintings<br/>
                    only, an unholiness, a cast of Bacchanalian revelry, to say the least, an<br/>
                    unpleasingness, that does him dishonour.<span class="gloss-inline">

                    production of one of which were enough to repay a lifetime of labour with<br/>
                    immortality. There is a picture, I neither know where it is, nor what it<br/>
                    is, but there is a picture curtained up in one of the royal palaces of<br/>
            <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span>, the <span class="title-artwork-RUBENSSTAMBROSIUS"><span class="persName-STAMBROSE">St. Ambrosius</span></span>, I think, kneeling before a crucifix.<span class="gloss-inline">

              </a></span> There is<br/>
                    one single ray of yellow light falling faintly upon the grey hairs and holy<br/>
                    features of the venerable saint, the rest is in obscurity; there is nothing more,<br/>
                    nothing to disturb either the eye or the mind, and you feel calmed and<br/>
                    subdued when you look upon that one solitary figure, as if in the presence<br/>
                    of a superior being. It is impossible to see that picture, the reality is<br/>
                    too striking, and a reality so hallowed and so beautiful, that when the<br/>
                    curtain is again drawn over the picture, you feel as if awaking from a<br/>
                    dream of heaven. It is by such pictures as this that <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> has gained<br/>
                    his immortality; and it was, I believe, such a picture as this that I did not<br/>
                    see at <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span>. Then the disappointment made me worse, and I could<br/>
                    not stir out to see the room in which he was born. But it donʼt signify<br/>
                    talking. Reader, beware of the <span class="placeName-RHEINBERGHOTEL">Grosser Rheinberg hotel</span> at <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span>. Art<br/>
                    thou a poet, a painter, or a romancer? Imagine the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>, the beautiful,<br/>
                    the mighty, the celebrated <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>, fouler than the <span class="geogName-THAMES">Thames</span> at <span class="placeName-LONDONBRDG">London<br/>
                    Bridge</span>, compressed into almost as narrow a channel, washing dirty coal<br/>
                    wharfs on the one side; bogs, marshes, and coke manufactories on the<br/>
                    other, yellow with mud from beneath, black with tar and coal‐dust from<br/>
                    above, loaded with clumsy barges and dirty shipping; in short, a vile, sordid,<br/>
                    mercenary river, fit only for traffic, high Germans and low Dutchmen,<br/>
                    and you will have some idea of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>, as seen from the bedroom<br/>
                    windows of the Grosser Rheinberg.<span class="gloss-inline">

              </a></span> Oh, if thou wouldest see the Rhine as<br/>
                    it may be seen, as it ought to be seen, shut your eyes, sleep your time<br/>

                    out upon the terrace which looks forth over the swell of the deep waters<br/>
                    to the dim outline of the <span class="geogName-SIEBENGEBIRGE">seven mountains</span>,<span class="gloss-inline">

              </a></span> and there gaze and dream and<br/>
                    meditate. Secondly, Art thou an epicure? Imagine mutton‐chops which<br/>
                    ought to have been tough, but which age had made tender, accompanied<br/>
                    by circular cakes of congealed fat, denominated gravy, together with a<br/>
                    kind of brown ashes, apparently moistened with whale oil (which, I think,<br/>
                    they called fried potatoes), as an addition to your feast, and you have an<br/>
                    idea of a dinner of the Grosser Rheinberg. I have omitted one thing,<br/>
                    however, which was really capital—the vinegar. They called it Hock wine,<br/>
                    certainly, but that donʼt signify; you must not be led astray by names in<br/>
                    this part of the world. However, good vinegar would not make up for<br/>
                    the want, or worse than want, of everything else; and although the waiters<br/>
                    made a point of not appearing until the bell had been rung seven times,<br/>
                    we at last made them understand that we neither liked their mode of<br/>
                    waiting, nor the contents of their larder, and so, according to their<br/>
                    deserts, deserted them.</div>
         
         <div class="p">The <span class="placeName-STPETERCATHEDRAL">cathedral</span> is the richest in fretwork and carving, in the delicate<br/>
                    finish of every shaft, and buttress, and pinnacle, that I saw on the journey,<br/>
                    except <span class="placeName-MILAN">Milan</span>. They showed us, in a little Gothic chapel, three skulls,<br/>
                    which they told us were those of the Magi. They were set in framework<br/>
                    of gold, and covered with jewels, but the pomp became not the dry<br/>
                    bones. The soul‐less eye and fleshless cheek looked not the less horrible<br/>
                    though a diamond beamed through the one and a bar of gold bound the<br/>
                    other.<span class="gloss-inline">
