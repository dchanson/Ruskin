         <div class="p">The <span class="placeName-building-HEIDELBERG">castle of Heidelberg</span> is exceeding desolate. Armies have razed 
                    <br/>its foundations, the thunder hath riven its towers, and there is no sound 
                    <br/>in its courts, and the wind is still in the open galleries.<span class="gloss-inline">

              </a></span> The grass is very 
                    <br/>green on the floor of the hall of the banquet, and the wild birds build 
                    <br/>their nests in the watch‐towers, and they dwell in the dwellings of man, 
                    <br/>for they are forsaken and left, and there is no voice there—there is no 
                    <br/>complaining in the dungeon, and where is the voice of gladness in the 
                    <br/>hall? It is a ruin, a ruin, a desolate ruin. The husbandman sees it on 
                    <br/>the height of the hills as he looks up from the green valley, and remembers 
                    <br/>the power of his ancient princes, and knows not if he should grieve that 
                    <br/>their power is past away. I know not how it is, but all nations in all 
                    <br/>ages seem to have respected the juice of the fruit of the vine. All has 
                    <br/>yielded to it from time immemorial. When Marshal Turenne attacked the 
                    <br/>castle in question,<span class="gloss-inline">

              </a></span> it was but a touch and go. The foundations were 
                    <br/>blown up, the battlements were knocked down, the towers snapt like so 
                    <br/>many sticks of barley sugar, the statues decapitated, the carving crashed, 
                    <br/>the ditches filled, the castle ruined, but the cellars— Walk into them, sir, 
                    <br/>walk into them; there is not a rat dispossessed or in any manner disturbed.<div id="" class="pb"></div>
            <br/>Why, they seem to have stopped puffing off powder here as if they were 
                    <br/>afraid of shaking up the lees of the good old respectable wines. Even 
                    <br/>the timber of the new‐fangled fashionable cask (which, following the 
                    <br/>example of the ladies nowadays, has gone without hoops) are not a whit 
                    <br/>disturbed, but sit there in peaceful placidity, clasping each other in 
                    <br/>brotherly affection, but dry, very dry, unconscionably dry. And the cele‐
                    <br/>brated butt sounds mournfully hollow—<span class="gloss-inline">
