               <div class="p">Poet and forger. <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span> was born in <span class="placeName-BRISTOL">Bristol</span>, where he entered a charity school at age eight and soon began to exhibit precocious learning. 
                    By age twelve, he launched his elaborate forgery scheme of composing works he attributed to a <span class="date-1400-1499">fifteenth‐century</span> priest, <span class="persName-TRPriest">Thomas Rowley</span>, 
                    and producing material evidence using scraps of old parchment. Ambitious to make a literary career, at age seventeen he threatened suicide in order 
                    to dissolve his apprenticeship as a legal scrivener to a <span class="placeName-BRISTOL">Bristol</span> attorney. Less successfully, he attempted to use his <span class="persName-TRPriest">Rowley</span> forgeries to capture the patronage of the antiquarian, 
                    <span class="persName-HW">Horace Walpole</span> (<span class="date-1717-1797">1717‐97</span>), but <span class="persName-HW">Walpole</span> recognized the imposture. <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span> set out for <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, where he began to rise rapidly in reputation as a free‐lance writer, 
                    but his career was abruptly cut off by a poisoning, which <span class="persName-NG">Nick Groom</span> attributes to misjudged mixing of recreational opium with arsenic treatment for venereal disease 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#CHATTERTONDNB" target="_self"><span class="persName-NG">Groom</span>, <span class="title-essay-CHATTERTONDNB">“Chatterton, Thomas (<span class="date-1752-1770">1752‐70</span>)”</span></a>).
                </div>
               
               <div class="p">As a Romantic mythology developed around the figure of <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span>, competing ideas of what he represented were available in the decades following his death, 
                    as <span class="persName-DF">David Fairer</span> describes. In one idea, he was not a boy but a “manly” youth, and a fearless defender of political liberty. 
                    Alternatively, some emphasized his role as victim, spurned by the haughty <span class="persName-HW">Walpole</span> and abandoned by society to die in a garret, 
                    a rare and neglected poetic spirit. In the idea of <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span>ʼs victimization, the satiric mode shades into the “lyric‐descriptive”,
                    as <span class="persName-DF">Fairer</span> puts it, with fragile flower imagery predominating, and with a tendency to present <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span>ʼs poetic voice as disembodied. 
                    Finally, a dramatic mode imagined the horrors and suffering of what was commonly believed to have been the youthʼs suicidal death
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#FAIRERCHATTERTON" target="_self"><span class="persName-DF">Fairer</span>, <span class="title-essay-FAIRERCHATTERTON">“Chattertonʼs Poetic Afterlife, <span class="date-1770-1794">1770–1794”</span></span></a>, 232‐40).
                </div>
               
               <div class="p">Of these modes, it was the lyric‐descriptive, and the idea of <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span> as victim, which <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> suggests when invoking the myth of the spurned poet 
                    in an <span class="date">1834</span> letter to <a href="/notes/hogg_james_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-JH">James Hogg</span> (ca.<span class="date-1770-1835">1770–1835</span>)</a>. 
                    While not naming <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> draws on the mythology surrounding the boy poet when broaching the question of whether <span class="persName-JJR">John Ruskin</span> 
                    was truly a youthful genius and poet in the making; and if so, what he and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> should do to protect and nurture the boyʼs talent: 
                    “we dread the sacrifice of our offspring by making him a victim to the pangs of despised verse, a sacrifice to a thankless world, 
                    who read, admire, and trample on the greatest and the best” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#GARDENMEMORIALS" target="_self"><span class="persName-MGHGARDEN">Garden</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-GARDENMEMORIALS"><i>Memorials of James Hogg</i></span></a>, 275).
                </div>
               
               <div class="p">The extent to which <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span> was present in the Ruskinsʼ imagination is difficult to judge. 
                    While the “marvellous boy,” in <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span>ʼs phrase, had become inextricably bound to the Romanticsʼ idea of literary precocity, 
                    suicide was a particularly unwelcome topic in the Ruskin family, 
                    owing to the death of <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs father, 
                    <span class="persName-JTR">John Thomas Ruskin</span> (<span class="date-1761-1817">1761‐1817</span>), by his own hand, 
                    a suicide that occurred when <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> was on the premises.  
                    It is possible that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> originally composed his elegiac poem, 
                    <a href="/apparatuses/twas_night_i_stood_by_tweeds_fair_stream_apparatus" target="_self">“ʼTwas night. I stood by Tweedʼs fair stream”</a>, 
                    in <span class="date-1831">1831</span> in reference to <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span>, but altered details to refer instead 
                    to <a href="/notes/scott_walter_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span> (<span class="date-1771-1832">1771–1832</span>)</a>, 
                    when the Scottish poet died a short time later. 
                    In the draft of the poem, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> named the <span class="placeName-AVONRIVER">Avon River</span>, which flows through <span class="placeName-BRISTOL">Bristol</span>, 
                    but then he changed the riverʼs name to the <span class="geogName-TWEEDRIVER">Tweed</span>.
                </div> 
               
               <div class="p">Years later, in his <span class="title-essay-RUSKINACADEMYNOTES"><i>Academy Notes</i></span> for <span class="date">1856</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> admired the painting of the poetʼs suicide by <span class="persName-HWPAINTER">Henry Wallis</span> (<span class="date-1830-1916">1830ʼ1916</span>), but wrote about it in very general terms, exhorting viewers to “examine it well inch by inch,” 
                    for the sake of its “entire placing before your eyes of an actual fact—and that a solemn one” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 14: 60). 
                    Just as this picture would soon become associated with the scandal that developed between its painter and the wife of its model, 
                    <span class="persName-GM">George Meredith</span> (<span class="date-1828-1909">1828‐1909</span>), another aspect of the <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span> myth perhaps became disturbingly pertinent to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>—the poetʼs androgynous and permanent boyishness, 
                    asexual and unwed (contrary to the historical <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span>ʼs promiscuity). As <span class="persName-JCCRITIC">Julie Crane</span> concludes, 
                    “for the Victorians, whose plots used marriage as a device, [yet] for whom in their lives . . . [marriage] was often a disaster, . . . 
                    the pre‐Romantic <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span> became a Romantic figure of disturbing possibilities: both endlessly fecund and self‐dividing into different ways and suggestivenss; 
                    and a silenced being, unwed, austere”
