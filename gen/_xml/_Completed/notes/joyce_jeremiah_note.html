                    brought him under suspicion by the government, and in <span class="date-1794">1794</span> he was charged with treason and imprisoned for a few months. 
                    From <span class="date-1790">1790</span>, he was appointed tutor to the sons of <span class="persName-CSES">Charles Stanhope, third earl of Stanhope</span> (<span class="date-1753-1816">1753–1816</span>), an advocate in the House of Lords 
                    for radical causes who styled himself “Citizen Stanhope”, and also a significant inventor and man of science.

                    who could “never remember being so wrapt up in any book” despite the disapproval by his father, <span class="persName-JMPHILOSOPHER">James Mill</span>,
