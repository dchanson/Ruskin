               <div class="p">Engravers, based in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>. The brothers worked jointly, overseeing a large workshop employing many assistants and pupils of the trade. 
                    They specialized in landscape, although they also undertook many portraits. 
                    <span class="persName-WF">William</span>ʼs achievements in steel‐engraving include the vignettes after <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span> for <span class="persName-SR">Samuel Roger</span>ʼs <i> <span class="title-book-ROGERSITALY">Italy</span> </i> (<span class="date-1830">1830</span>) 
                    and <span class="persName-">Rogers</span>ʼs <i> <span class="title-book-ROGERSPOEMS1834">Poems</span> </i> (<span class="date-1834">1834</span>), complementing <span class="persName-EG">Edward Goodall</span>ʼs work after <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> for those volumes. 
                    <span class="persName-EG">Edward</span>ʼs well‐known works include the plates for <span class="persName-WBI">William Brockedon</span>ʼs 
                    <i> <span class="title-book-BROCKEDONILLUSTRATIONS">Illustrations of the Passes of the Alps</span> </i> (<span class="date-1827-1829">1827‐29</span>). 
                    The brothers enjoyed a long relationship with the firm of <span class="persName-JM">John Murray</span>, for example contributing significantly to the <span class="date-1841">1841</span> edition of 
                    <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>ʼs <i> <span class="title-book-BYRONPILGRIMAGE">Childe Haroldʼs Pilgrimage</span> </i>.
                </div>
               
               <div class="p">The Findens attempted publishing in their own right, 
                    issuing for example <i> <span class="title-book-FINDENSILLUSTRATIONSBYRON">Findenʼs Landscape Illustrations to Mr. Murrayʼs First Complete and Uniform Edition of the Life and Works of Lord Byron</span> </i> 
                    (<span class="date-1832-1834">1832‐34</span>). Because these projects proved so ambitious, however, the brothers ultimately relied on collaborations with other publishers. Such was the case, for example, 
                    with <i> <span class="title-book-FINDENSILLUSTRATIONSBIBLE">Findenʼs Landscape Illustrations to the Bible</span> </i> (<span class="date-1834-1837">1834‐37</span>).
