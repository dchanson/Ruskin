                    the family holidayed in <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span>, a journey from <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> to <span class="placeName-SUSSEX">Sussex</span>

                    narrative, although it is possible that the story refers to a previous season. Seaside resorts attracted the elder Ruskins

                    and it may be that evidence referring apparently to two separate northern journeys, of <span class="date-1826">1826</span> and of <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, in fact refer
                    to a single tour of <span class="date-1827">1827</span>.</div>
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> took as his first point of reference the poems <a href="/apparatuses/on_scotland_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRONSCOTLAND">“On Scotland”</span></a> 
                    in <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>,

                    The former, he declared, “record[s <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs] impressions received during a journey from

                    in <span class="date-1826">1826</span>. Specifically, he believed, the poem captured the return journey, given the poemʼs trope of changes: one
                    line “is no doubt a reminiscence of the <span class="date-1826-05">May</span> sunshine in which they went northwards; for their start was usually made about the middle of May; and
                    [<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>] contrasts the sunny anticipation of the arrival with the autumnal gloom of the departure”
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS4D1891" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i> [4<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>]</span></a>,

                    strength of this interpretation, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> renamed this poem <span class="title-poem-JRONSCOTLAND">“Farewell
                    to Scotland”</span> (see <a href="/apparatuses/on_scotland_apparatus#TITLE" target="_self">“To Scotland”: Title</a>).</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">The latter portion of this interpretation, at the very least, has been disproved by <span class="persName-VAB">Van Akin Burd</span>, who points out
                    that, in <span class="date-1826-05">May 1826</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> was on the road
                    beyond his <span class="date-1826-05-10">10 May</span> birthday, as attested by his dated letters to <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> extending through the end of the month.
                    Business had been lean that year, thus delaying a family holiday (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>,
                    137, 139 n. 1, 150 n. 5, 137).</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">Moreover, further upsetting the familyʼs routine, in <span class="date-1826-04-1826-05">April and May 1826</span> they
                    coped with the consumptive decline and death of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> <span class="persName-JRPSON">cousin</span>,
                    <a href="/notes/richardson_james_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-JRPSON">James Richardson</span></a>, who had been living at
                    <a href="/notes/herne_hill_note" target="_self"><span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span></a> while working at
                    <a href="/notes/ruskin_telford_note" target="_self">Ruskin, Telford, and Domecq</a>. 
                    By <span class="date-1826-04">April</span>, <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span>ʼs health had declined so alarmingly that he returned to his family in 
                    <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>, possibly escorted on this journey by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>. 
                    The youth died soon after his return, on <span class="date-1826-05-08">8 May</span>, a few days before <span class="date-1826-05-10"><span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs birthday</span>. 
                    When <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> learned of his <span class="persName-JRPSON">nephew</span>ʼs death, he was traveling in the northwest, and he did not return home until 
                    <span class="date-1826-05-25-1826-05-31">the end of May</span> at the earliest 
                    (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 139 n. 1, 149; see also

                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> states that “in <span class="date-1826-04">April</span> the Ruskins took . . . <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span> 
                    back to <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>,” an inference that he presumably takes from <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs 
                    <a href="/apparatuses/mr_to_jjr_1826-05-07_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter</span> of <span class="date-1826-05-07-1826-05-08">7–8 May</span></a>, in which she reflects on <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span>ʼs 
                    “journey up”. <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> is reminding her husband that, on this journey, 
                    <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span> “had none of that spirit which youths of his age usually have” so that 
                    “both you & I had repeatedly asked him if he was quite sure he was happy and . . . he had assured us in the strongest terms he was”. 
                    While <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs comments leave some doubt about who made the trip with <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span>, 
                    it seems unlikely that, even if both the elder Ruskins undertook this sad journey to <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>, 
                    they would have risked bringing <span class="persName-JR">John</span>. Considering that <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> 
                    warned <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span>ʼs mother, <span class="persName-JRP">Jessie Richardson</span>, 
                    “that the children should not be much with . . . [<span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span>] for fear
                    of infection” (referring to his brothers and sisters), it seems strange that she would have exposed her own <span class="persName-JR">son</span> 
                    during a long journey. <span class="persName-JR">John</span> would also have stood a good chance of having to witness 
                    <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span>ʼs death, since <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> believed that 
                    “worlds could not save him”. She concluded this much “when <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span>
                    was at <span class="placeName-CROYDON">Croydon</span>”, referring to the house of her sister, <span class="persName-BR">Bridget Richardson</span>. 
                    Thus, perhaps <span class="persName-JR">John</span> was left with his <span class="placeName-CROYDON">Croydon</span> aunt, uncle, and cousins, while his parents 
                    carried <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span> to <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>

                  <div class="p">Did <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs fears prevent the family from journeying north in <span class="date-1826">1826</span> altogether, even later in the year? 
                    While <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> corrects <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs assumption that the Scottish journey occurred in <span class="date-1826-05">May</span>,
                    he relies on the same evidence as does <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> to affirm that “the family probably went in <span class="date-1826-09">September” 1826</span> 
                    to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>

                    Both conclusions go back to the evidence of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, <a href="/apparatuses/glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRGLENOFGLENFARG">“Glen of Glenfarg” (“Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill”)</span></a>, 
                    and to <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs belief that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrote it, like <a href="/apparatuses/on_scotland_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRONSCOTLAND">“On Scotland”</span></a>, either 
                    “during the journey home” from a <span class="date-1826-03-20-1826-06-21">spring</span> tour to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> (which
                    certainly did not occur), “or on his return [to <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>], in <span class="date-1826-09">September</span>”

                        comes from an annotation to that effect by <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> in the manuscript.

                    <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, but the hand appears to be <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs.) It is
                    possible that a <span class="date-1826-09">September 1826</span> journey resulted in this poem along with the entirety of <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>

                     <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> noted her <span class="persName-JR">son</span> as having started

                    as <span class="date-1826-09-1827-01">September or October 1826 through January 1827</span>) 
                    is <span class="title-poem-JRONSCOTLAND">“On Scotland”</span>—and that poem might be interpreted as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs elegy on
                    his cousin, <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span>, rather than as a topographical poem based on eyewitness
                    travel.

                        the itinerary took the Ruskins first to <span class="placeName-SALTHILL">Salt Hill</span>, a major stage west of <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, opening to the <span class="placeName-GWR">Great West Road</span>; 
                       however, rather than heading west toward <span class="placeName-BRISTOL">Bristol</span>, 
                        the Ruskins turned northwest to <span class="placeName-OXFORD">Oxford</span>, 
                        where they stayed briefly to view the colleges. They proceeded through <span class="placeName-GLOUCESTER">Gloucester</span>, presumably on a straight path to <span class="placeName-ROSSONWYE">Ross‐on‐Wye</span>, 
                        an established launching place for a tour of the <span class="geogName-WYE">Wye Valley</span>, but 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs account next mentions <span class="placeName-MONMOUTH">Monmouth</span>. It is not clear, therefore, whether the prose account accurately describes the sequence of the itinerary. 
                       <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> describes <span class="placeName-building-TINTERN">Tintern Abbey</span> at length, followed by a reference to <span class="placeName-WINDCLIFF">Windcliff</span>—one of the eminences surrounding the dramatic bend in the river that 
                        encloses the peninsula of <span class="placeName-LANCAUT">Lancaut</span>—but the narrative neglects to mention <span class="placeName-RAGLAN">Raglan Castle</span>, which figures prominently as the subject of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem

                        Thus, it seems likely that the travel narrative and poetry anthology are governed less by concerns for accuracy, like a memoir, 
                        than by the high points of picturesque viewing (indeed, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">“Harry and Lucy”</span> purports to be a fictionalized lesson in the manner the <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED">Edgeworthsʼ series of lessons</span>,

                        By the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>, however, the Ruskins would have benefited from easier carriage access 
                        owing to road improvements, including a new turnpike from <span class="placeName-CHEPSTOW">Chepstow</span> and a carriageway from <span class="placeName-MONMOUTH">Monmouth</span> to <span class="placeName-RAGLAN">Raglan Castle</span>; 
                        and in the year of their journey, the Ruskins could have observed an industrial‐age iron bridge under construction at <span class="placeName-BIGSWEIR">Bigsweir</span>, 
                        midway between <span class="placeName-building-TINTERN">Tintern</span> and <span class="placeName-MONMOUTH">Monmouth</span>. If they left their carriage for a water excursion, 
                        they could have embarked on one of the steam packets that had been operating throughout the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>

                        the family took the length of the <span class="geogName-WYE">Wye Valley</span> excursion at least from <span class="placeName-MONMOUTH">Monmouth</span> to <span class="placeName-building-TINTERN">Tintern Abbey</span> 
                        (the tour normally departing from <span class="placeName-ROSSONWYE">Ross‐on‐Wye</span> and ending at <span class="placeName-CHEPSTOW">Chepstow</span>). 
                        At <span class="placeName-MONMOUTH">Monmouth</span>, a short ride would have brought the visitors to <span class="placeName-RAGLAN">Raglan Castle</span>,

                        showing open water crowded with both large ships under full sail and smoking steamboats, so it appears likely that the Ruskins continued

                        Not only were these guidebooks popular and widely available, but there is also evidence of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs close attention to <span class="persName-CTH">Heath</span>ʼs

                        may have borrowed from <span class="title-book-HEATHRAGLANDCASTLE"><i>Historical and Descriptive Accounts of the Ancient and Present State of Ragland Castle</i></span>, 
                        in which <span class="persName-CTH">Heath</span> organizes information under the two heads, 
                        “The Castle in Its Present State, as It Is Now Shewn” and “The Castle in Its Splendor”—the latter 
                        reconstructing the castleʼs past state, “when newly built”, as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> puts it.

               Unless the sea voyage is fanciful, it is quite possible that the Ruskins traveled by sea from <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span> to <span class="placeName-GLASGOW">Glasgow</span>,
