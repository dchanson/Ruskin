               <div class="p">Between <span class="date-1826-1828">1826 and 1828</span>, astronomy featured prominently in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poetry and prose, 
                    from his first mention of the typical beginnerʼs constellation for British children, <span class="name--CHARLESSWAIN">Charlesʼs Wain</span>, 
                    in the <span class="date-1826-1827">1826/27</span> poem, 
                    <a href="/apparatuses/glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-GLENOFGLENFARG">“Glen of Glenfarg” [“Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill”]</span></a>; 
                    to his cataloguing of constellation names from all around the celestial globe in the <span class="date-1827-1828">1827/28</span> poem, 
                    <a href="/apparatuses/constellations_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span></a>; 
                    to the task of memorizing constellation names and their respective numbers of stars, which is assigned to his character <span class="persName-LUCY">Lucy</span> in the <span class="date-1828-1829">1828/29</span> dialogue, 
                    <a href="/apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III”</span></a>;
                    to his Miltonic hymn of praise to the sun in the <a href="/notes/new_years_poems_note" target="_self">New Yearʼs poem</a> for <span class="date-1828-01-01">January 1828</span>, 
                    <a href="/apparatuses/the_sun_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHESUN">“The Sun”</span></a>. 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composed these works in context of rising popular education in astronomy for adults and children 
                    in the <span class="date-1800-1839">first three decades of the nineteenth century</span> in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>. 
                    On the evidence of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs writing about astronomy, he was engaged more by the poetic sublimity of the subject than by the science, 
                    although the works contain hints that he gained at least a basic conceptual understanding of the apparent rotations of the solar system and the fixed stars.</div>

                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">“Harry”</span> “took one of his lesson books and made <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> learn the following constellations with the number of stars” (2); 
                            and there follow lists of constellation names paired with their respective numbers of stars. The identity of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs “lesson book” has so far eluded detection 
                            since <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span>ʼs totals of stars fail to match the numbers given in British astronomy texts commonly available in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>. 
                            The counts of observable stars within the constellation boundaries changed over time, and the constellations themselves 
                            changed as new ones were added and others consigned to obsolescence, so it is not necessarily surprising that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs source remains unidentified. 
                            It is also possible that he devised his own method of counting stars, such as numbering only stars of a certain magnitude that he found on a celestial globe or star chart. 
                            Whatever the case, the kind of text normally associated with this exacting information was a <i>star atlas</i>.</div>

                                    the dialogues that compose the tale are aimed less at information about astronomy per se than at an ethical framework for learning.

                                    <span class="persName-JFERGUSON">James Ferguson</span> (<span class="date-1710-1776">1710–76</span>), who from boyhood devised his own means to chart the constellations on paper 
                                    (perhaps the inspiration of the exercise devised by <span class="persName-TD">Day</span>ʼs <span class="persName-fictional-TUTORTD">Tutor</span>) and invented and constructed astronomical and other instruments, although some of his inventions already existed. 
                                    Admiration of this biography deranges <span class="persName-FRANKME">Frank</span>ʼs more modest and systematic lessons with his mother, who warns him that 
                                    “not . . . one in ten of these self‐taught persons ever distinguish themselves in the world, or excite that wonder, or obtain that glory, of which you are so desirous”. 
                                    Nonetheless, <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> is ambitious to imitate <span class="persName-JFERGUSON">Ferguson</span>ʼs “projects”, first attempting and failing with <span class="persName-fictional-MARYME">Mary</span> to make their own paper‐covered globe. 
                                    “But still as one scheme failed, another rose in <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span>ʼs imagination; and he went on from one to another, 
                                    pleased always with the last new idea, yet finishing few; for some he found impossible, some not sufficiently surprising, 
                                    and almost all were too tiresome, he said, to be worth completing”. Finally, enchanted by an engraving of an orrery in <span class="persName-JFERGUSON">Ferguson</span>ʼs book—a 
                                    mechanical model of the solar system, which <span class="persName-JFERGUSON">Ferguson</span> had also devised on his own system, without investigating the mechanisms of existing orreries—<span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> 
                                    himself ventures on this “‘very ingenious thing, exceedingly ingenious’”. Although he sets forth without learning even “half . . . [of the planetsʼ] motions”, 
                                    having neglected the <span class="persName-fictional-ENGINEERME">Engineer</span>ʼs assignment of readings in <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="title-book-">Scientific Dialogues</span>, he believes he could teach himself, like <span class="persName-JFERGUSON">Ferguson</span>, “as he went on with his work”; 
                                    and his mother, unaware of the extent of <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span>ʼs ambitions, allows him to proceed, so that he “will soon find out, by your own experience, what you can, and what you cannot do”. 
                                    While he at least sticks to a single project, the complexity of the orrery soon exceeds <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span>ʼs abilities, and he nearly disgraces himself in reciting his appointed studies. 
                                    His father counsels him: “‘I would rather, . . . as your father and friend, . . that you had the power of keeping to your resolutions, 
                                    than that you made the most ingenious thing that ever was thought of by a boy of your age’”

                        <div class="p">The dialogue recognizes that learning complex sciences calls on abilites and virtues that can conflict with one another—ingenuity and resolution, enthusiasm and steadiness. 
                                    As <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMAME">Mamma</span> admits to <span class="persName-fictional-MARYME">Mary</span>: “‘It is rather hard, I allow, . . . to reproach poor <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> at the same moment with two seemingly opposite faults, 
                                    with his not finishing any thing, and with his being too eager to finish one thing’”. In the taleʼs primary mission to instruct a childʼs self‐command, however, 
                                    the point of an episode of conflict is less to resolve competing virtues philosophically than for the child to internalize regulation of feeling. 
                                    As <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> promises in future to portion his time judiciously between fundamental lessons and ingenious projects, 
                                    his stirred “feelings of this moment would have inclined him to do too much, and to fix upon too many hours for <i>useful</i> studies; 
                                    but his mother advised him to attempt little, and engage but for few, that he might be more likely to keep to his intentions”. 
                                    Because the aim is self‐regulation of feeling, <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span>ʼs mother considers but one virtue to be paramount in the jostling of abilities: 
                                    candour, the want of which she expects “‘never [to] reproach him’”, since a misleading expression of feeling deranges the aim. 
                                    The contrary example of frank expresion in the tale is the dishonest boy, <span class="persName-fictional-TOMME">Tom</span>, whose lying vies with his spontaneous emotion, 
                                    and his silly mother, whose vanity and flightiness prevents her reading her childʼs expression insightfully

                                As exercises in memorization, the scripture quotations that annotate the lists are at least as important as the constellation names. 
                                Following the lists, <span class="persName-MMS">Sherwood</span>ʼs text does explain rudimentary concepts, such as the <i>ecliptic</i> and celestial <i>equator</i>, 
                                which are necessary to understanding the principles governing how the lists of constellations are subdivided into northern, southern, and zodiac groups.</div>

                                to accompany <span class="title-toy-URANIASMIRROR"><i>Uraniaʼs Mirror; or A View of the Heavens</i></span>. The latter was a set of thirty‐two 8 × 5.5–inch cards, 
                                each card depicting the mythological representation of one or more constellations. The cards were perforated at the positions of the stars 
                                forming the constellation so that, when held up to a light, the cards mimicked a “view” of the respective constellations in the “heavens” with the colorful mythical figures superimposed. 
                                The cards were engraved by <span class="persName-SHALL">Sidney Hall</span> (<span class="date-1788-1831">1788/89[?]–1831</span>), the first map maker to engrave on steel,

                                the introduction gestures at the “sublime idea” of “worlds . . . peopled with myriads of intelligent beings, 
                                formed for endless progression towards perfection and felicity” as governed by the “<span class="smallcaps">INFINITE MIND</span>”; 
                                the chapter “History of Astronomy” begins with star‐gazing as recorded in the <span class="title-scripture-GENESIS">Genesis</span> narrative; 
                                and the chapter “Fixed Stars” impresses on the reader that “[t]he immense distance of the fixed stars from our earth, 
                                and from each other, is of all considerations the most proper for raising our ideas of the wonderful works of God”
                                (<a href="/notes/bibliography#ASPINASTRONOMY" target="_self"><span class="persName-JASPIN">Aspin</span>, <span class="title-book-ASPINASTRONOMY"><i>Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</i></span></a>, 2, 3, 100). 
                                Otherwise, the approach of the <span class="title-book-ASPINASTRONOMY"><i>Familiar Treatise</i></span> is nearer to the conceptual understanding sought by the instructional dialogues than to memorization exercises.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">To create the constellation cards for <span class="title-toy-URANIASMIRROR"><i>Uraniaʼs Mirror</i></span>, the engraver or the artist plagiarized the representations

                                as <span class="persName-IRIDPATH">Ridpath</span> has remarked (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RIDPATHURANIASMIRROR" target="_self">“<i>Uraniaʼs Mirror</i>”</a>). 
                                Likewise, to compile the accompanying primer, <span class="persName-JASPIN">Aspin</span> and the publisher appear to have drawn heavily on <span class="persName-AJ">Jamieson</span>ʼs atlas, while also moderating its forbiddingly technical demands 
                                for the common reader, including (it claims) younger readers. Just as the <span class="title-book-JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><i>Celestial Atlas</i></span> begins with “Definitions”, the <span class="title-book-ASPINASTRONOMY"><i>Familiar Treatise</i></span> presents “Terms Used in Astronomy”; however, 
                                whereas <span class="persName-AJ">Jamieson</span> follows with “Of the Manner of Using the Maps”, presented as a series of technical “problems” requiring mathematical skills, 
                                the <span class="title-book-ASPINASTRONOMY"><i>Familiar Treatise</i></span> eases the reader into a series of brief essays beginning broadly with “Of the Celestial Bodies Generally”. 
                                From there, the <span class="title-book-ASPINASTRONOMY"><i>Familiar Treatise</i></span> surveys topics familiar to young readers of the dialogues—gravitation, the structure and movements of the solar system, the bodies forming the solar system—but 
                                explained in greater detail and illustrated with diagrams. Only after this extensive preparation is the reader introduced to the constellations—the topic used by the astronomical dialogues 
                                and even by <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs primer to snare the young readerʼs initial interest in astronomy. The best is saved for last, however, 
                                as this section is keyed to the kitʼs accompanying constellation cards. Following an introductory chapter on the fixed stars, the constellations are described in the order and in the groups 
                                depicted on the cards, again borrowing from <span class="persName-AJ">Jamieson</span>ʼs text (in reduced form), by first summarizing each contellationʼs boundaries, chief stars and their magnitudes, and other identifying features; 
                                and then by relating, in short form, its legendary “fable”. This plan was in turn copied 
                                by the American academic, <span class="persName-JGREEN">Jacob Green</span>, in <span class="title-book-GREEN ASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><i>Astronomical Recreations</i></span>, and with a similar audience in mind (although the dates of his and <span class="persName-JASPIN">Aspin</span>ʼs 
                                publications are so close that it is unclear who copied whom).</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">As a primer for study specifically of the constellations, <span class="persName-JASPIN">Aspin</span>ʼs <span class="title-book-ASPINASTRONOMY"><i>A Familiar Treatise</i></span> 
                                differs from star atlases and even from other primers by limiting its scope to constellations viewable from <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>—a feature 
                                rendering the book less likely to have served as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs source for <a href="/apparatuses/constellations_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span></a>, 
                                albeit opening a window onto the uniquely British amateur astronomer in the <span class="date-1800-1899">nineteenth century</span>. For example, the section on the constellations supplies two fold‐out maps, 
                                one a planar representation of the “Northern Hemisphere” (cribbed from <span class="persName-AJ">Jamieson</span>ʼs chart in the <span class="title-book-JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><i>Celestial Atlas</i></span>), 
                                piecing together all the sectional views with outlines of the mythical figures, as rendered on the cards making up <span class="name--URANIASMIRROR">“Uraniaʼs Mirror”</span>; 
                                and the second a “Chart of the Heavens from the Latitude of <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>”, divided into the boundaries of the visible constellations, 
                                each of which is tinted with a distinct color for clarity and mapped with the constellationʼs chief stars. 
                                The book presents no fold‐out chart of the southern hemisphere, however; and while providing a list of the southern constellations, 
                                the detailed descriptions of each constellation, like the cards constituting <span class="name--URANIASMIRROR">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span>, 
                                include only those southern constellations that are partially visible at the latitude of <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>. 
                                In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span>, the first two southern constellations that are listed in the poem (in its original version), 
                                the <span class="name--CRUX">Southern Cross</span> and <span class="name--CHARLESSOAK">Charlesʼs Oak</span>, are never visible from <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> and therefore omitted from representation or discussion

                                a memorization drill, which lists constellation names like <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs exercise, but which is thoroughly secular, with no <span class="title-scripture-KJV">Bible</span> verses attached. 
                                The drill also suggests, however, that he consulted either a star atlas or a primer like <span class="persName-JASPIN">Aspin</span>ʼs derived from an atlas, since <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> is ordered 
                                to “learn the following constellations with the number of stars” belonging to each formation. 
                                There follow at intervals in the narrative columns of ten to twelve constellation names in English with their respective total number of stars,

                            Plates and globes depicted the mythical figures for which the constellations were named; and plates were found in star atlases, 
                            which among other information related the stories associated with the stars and constellations,
