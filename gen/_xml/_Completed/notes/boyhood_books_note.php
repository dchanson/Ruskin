               <div class="p">The aim of this note is not to provide an exhaustive listing of books that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> read or consulted in his youth. 
                    Information about <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s reading and its influences is available throughout <i>ERM</i>, 
                    in the apparatuses and glosses of works containing specific allusions to and borrowings from publications to which he was exposed. 
                    Especially influential authors and published sources, moreover, are discussed in notes of their own. 
                    This information can be accessed using the archive&#x02BC;s Search. A portion of this note does attempt, however, to convey the scope of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s childhood and youthful reading 
                    through a descriptive (but not exhaustive) <a href="#CHRONOLOGY">Chronology</a> as well as to summarize 
                    <a href="#APPROPRIATE_READING">The Ruskins&#x02BC; Program of Age&#x2010;Appropriate Reading for John</a>. These resources remain open to development.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Among the main purposes of this note is to centralize some <a href="#RESOURCES">Resources</a> for researching the Ruskin family reading during <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s youth

                    These published print sources remain the starting point for all investigations of the Ruskin family reading,

                     <div class="p">Assuming that an item of children&#x02BC;s literature can be traced to <span class="placeName-building-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span>, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s final home, its presence in his adult library is only a starting point for extending the item&#x02BC;s provenance 
                            to <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span>, his boyhood home. 
                             
                            For example, among a <a href="#BEINECKEBOOKS">collection of books held by the <span class="placeName-building-BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke Library</span></a> 
                            supposed to have belonged to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in boyhood, 
                            there are two bound assemblages of separately published works, which were acquired by the collector, 
                            <span class="persName-FJS">F. J. Sharp</span>. The responsibility for these bindings is unknown. While some of the individual items contained therein bear 
                            marginalia recognizably in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s mature hand, the evidence for associating each of the items therein 
                            with his boyhood is variable, in some cases amounting to little more than the publication date falling within the relevant range. 
                            As an example of problematic items among the Beinecke holdings, a copy of 
                            <span class="title-lesson-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span> 
                            by <span class="persName-JAIKIN">John Aikin</span> and <span class="persName-ALB">Anna Laetitia Barbauld</span>, 
                            which is undated on the title page, very likely is not the edition <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> used in boyhood. 
                            While a bookplate authenticates the copy as a <span class="placeName-building-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span> book, 
                            and it contains some annotations in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s mature hand, 
                            other bibliographical details place its acquisition after his boyhood absorption in <span class="title-lesson-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span>&#x2014;perhaps long after 
                            (see <a href="#EVENINGS"><i>Beinecke</i> no. 4</a>). 
                            As in any case for provenance, one can only weigh the evidence, and one purpose of 
                            <a href="#DESCRIPTIONS">Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Boyhood and Youth</a> is to compile what is known.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">A unique boon for tracing the provenance of books to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s boyhood and youth is the record of book and periodical purchases contained in 
                            <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s ledger of household accounts, the &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#RFMS28" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-manuscript-RFMS28">Account Book</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;. 
                            These brief entries, which <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> included under the heading &#x201C;Sundries&#x201D; for each year, 
                            and which he notated usually with an identification of author and/or title along with the cost, are compiled 
                            by <span class="persName-VAB">Van Akin Burd</span> in the &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#RFL" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 
                            collected by year of acquisition and placed among the explanatory notes. <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s sketchy identifications include no publication details, 
                            and some entries can be difficult even to distinguish as books from other kinds of &#x201C;sundries&#x201D;. <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> helpfully links some of <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s costs 
                            to prices in publisher&#x02BC;s listings. The researcher should therefore start with <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>&#x02BC;s annotated lists, while what is gathered 
                            in <a href="#ANNUALLISTS">Lists of Annual Book Purchases by the Ruskin Family</a> are possible additional items found in the 
                            &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#RFMS28" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-manuscript-RFMS28">Account Book</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;.</div>

                            as an indicator of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s early reading is that it
                            begins in <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, omitting records of book purchases prior to his eighth year.  
                            This was the period when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s parents would have acquired many of the publications most commonly associated with Romantic&#x2010;era and early Victorian writing for children, 
                            from fairy tales to moral and scientific dialogues. The gap in the evidence of <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s accounts 
                            shifts all the more significance onto the provenance of physical books alleged to have survived from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s boyhood library.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">Other sources of evidence about the family&#x02BC;s commerce in juvenile literature prior to <span class="date-1827">1827</span> (and afterward) are found in remarks about books in the family letters, 
                            along with literary allusions detectable in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s juvenilia. While some of these allusions and passing references 
                            can be cross&#x2010;referenced to bibliographical details known from another source or even to a physical copy, 
                            other references in the letters reveal only a title, which is discussed as an <a href="#UNTRACED">Untraced Book</a>. 
                            For example, in a letter dated <span class="date-1823">1823</span>, when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was four years old, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> suggested books to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> 
                            that would make acceptable gifts for <span class="persName-JR">John</span>: &#x201C;if you bring any thing for him let it be

                            he has had so much medicine to take that I have been obliged to buy I don&#x02BC;t know how many books 
                            and you might perhaps bring him some he has already&#x005B;.&#x005D; You can bring nothing he will be so well pleased with as a book&#x201D;

Since no evidence survives attesting whether these books were ever acquired, 
                            or, if purchased, in what edition, the titles are relegated to the list of

                            the intended recipient. It is possible that some book titles, especially of children&#x02BC;s literature, may have been meant for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s cousins, particularly

                            &#x201C;the books owned by all three Ruskins must be considered to be part of &#x2018;Ruskin&#x02BC;s Library&#x2019; because he ultimately inherited his parents&#x02BC; possessions, 
                            as well as having the use of them during their lifetimes&#x201D; 
                            (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-book-DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><i>Library of John Ruskin</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, xv, xxiv), 
                            one wonders how far the availability, much less the inheritance, extended in the case of <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>&#x02BC;s books. 
                            To what extent did <span class="persName-JR">John</span> and <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> share books? 
                            Similar speculation surrounds duplicate copies found in <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s accounts, such as his purchase of a <span class="title-book-DEFOEROBINSONCRUSOE"><i>Robinson Crusoe</i></span> in <span class="date-1835">1835</span>, 
                            long after he presented <span class="persName-JR">John</span> with an edition in <span class="date-1826">1826</span> that cost two guineas 
                            (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#RFL" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 301 n. 12; &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span>, <span class="title-book-DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><i>Library of John Ruskin</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 91 &#x005B;no. 694&#x005D;). 
                            Alternatively, rather than indicating books purchased for others outside the immediate family, duplicate titles might refer to additional, compact editions to be taken on travels. 
                            Such usage would apply particularly to a work like <span class="title-book-DEFOEROBINSONCRUSOE"><i>Robinson Crusoe</i></span>, which was deemed permissible reading on Sundays, 
                            and therefore counted as a necessary travel item, just as <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> packed a copy of <span class="persName-JBUNYAN">Bunyan</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-BUNYANGRACEABOUNDING"><i>Grace Abounding</i></span> for <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s first journey to <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> without his parents, in <span class="date-1845">1845</span>

                            As revealed by <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s comment quoted above from an <span class="date-1823">1823</span> letter, however, 
                            <span class="persName-MR">she</span> also was an occasional purchaser. The kinds of texts <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> mentions were available as booklets with engravings for sixpence or a shilling, 
                            a cost that presumably could be absorbed within her household budget. As one source for recommended titles, she may have consulted 
                            the &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/evangelical_magazine_note" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-periodical-EVANGELICALMAG"><i>Evangelical Magazine</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E; for lists of recently published children&#x02BC;s books. 
                            These <span class="date-1823">1823</span> book purchases occurred before <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s extant &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#RFMS28" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-manuscript-RFMS28">Account Book</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E; begins,

                            these expenses are comprised solely of household staples. The miscellaneous items comprised by &#x201C;Sundries&#x201D;, 
                            from dessert forks to <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span> novels, may have all been paid by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, 
                            but it seems unlikely that he would have done all the shopping himself. Would <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> have personally arranged, for example,  
                            for a &#x201C;dress for my sister &#x005B;<span class="persName-JRP">Janet Richardson</span>&#x005D;&#x201D; ()?</div>

This practice was inherited from his <span class="persName-JJR">father</span>, 
                        who was generous with purchases of books for his family&#x02BC;s education and entertainment. Still, there is no way of knowing 
                        whether publications that left their influence on the early writings were borrowed or owned,

                        How publications by <span class="persName-FDH">Hemans</span> passed through their hands&#x2014;whether by purchase, borrowing, or casually encountering a periodical&#x2014;remains unknown.</div>

                            Ruskin&#x02BC;s parents evidently took no part in this contest between the Romantics and the educationists, 
                            if they were even aware of it. Recent scholarship has shown how &#x201C;Science&#x201D; and &#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; or 
                            concepts of <i>reason</i> and <i>imagination</i> were more entangled 
                            in education and children&#x02BC;s literature of the long <span class="date-1700-1799">eighteenth century</span> than <span class="persName-CLE">Lamb</span> cared to admit; 
                            and critics have revolutionized our understanding of how women educationists such as <span class="persName-ALB">Letitia Barbauld</span> and <span class="persName-STRIMMER">Sarah Trimmer</span> 
                            contributed an alternative sociability and sense of self to Romanticism. Moreover, where <span class="persName-CLE">Lamb</span> saw a uniform pedagogy in the educationists&#x02BC; &#x201C;nonsense&#x201D;, 
                            scholars have discerned distinct politics in <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>&#x02BC;s Dissenter progressivism and in <span class="persName-STRIMMER">Trimmer</span>&#x02BC;s Anglican conservatism. 
                            The Ruskins must have been able to distinguish these differences, as well, yet the evidence points to catholicity in their choices of children&#x02BC;s literature. 
                            They shared neither the Romantics&#x02BC; hostility toward progressive instructional works such as the Edgeworths&#x02BC; practical education 
                            nor <span class="persName-STRIMMER">Trimmer</span>&#x02BC;s suspicions of imaginative works such as fairy tales, whether new or traditional.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">While they were not doctrinaire in their tastes, the elder Ruskins did adhere to a program of graduated and progressive age&#x2010;appropriate reading for children that had been 
                            introduced at the end of the previous century by <span class="persName-ALB">Mrs. Barbauld</span> and developed by the Edgeworths, and they proceeded according to a plan. 
                            Precise dates are elusive for when <span class="persName-JR">John</span> first engaged with many of the works he is known or believed to have read in his youth, 
                            but distinct phases of readings can be discerned. These phases can be correlated to developments in his own writing, 
                            which reflect his reading both in content and in the materiality of typography and illustration. The age&#x2010;appropriate layers 
                            of reading are permeable, however, as over time <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> retained his affection for re&#x2010;reading some works for children even into adulthood. 
                            The periods of age&#x2010;appropriate reading into which the following <a href="#CHRONOLOGY">Chronology</a> is divided are therefore approximate but not arbitrary,

                                    From this point, reading and writing advanced together, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> remarking on <span class="date-1823-03-15">15 March</span> that &#x201C;he is beginning to copy from his books and will soon learn himself to write I think&#x201D;. 
                                    A key children&#x02BC;s book of this period, which served <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in this process of instructing himself by copying, was 
                                    <span class="title-book-DAYHISTORY"><i>The History of Little Jack</i></span> by <span class="persName-TD">Thomas Day</span>

                                    Since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> seems to have been introduced to reading and writing prior to <span class="date-1823-03">March 1823</span>, his mother initially have lead him through works designed for very young children such as

                     <div class="p">On <span class="date-1823-03-11">11 March</span>, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s recommendation that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> acquire <span class="title-story-CHILDRENINTHEWOOD"><i>The Children in the Wood</i></span> and/or

                                    curiously juxtaposes a traditional tale of childhood vulnerability and death with a tale from the <span class="title-story-ARABIANNIGHTS">Arabian Nights</span> presenting the magical strength and good fortune that 
                                    <span class="persName-CLE">Lamb</span> meant by making &#x201C;the child a man, while all the time he suspected himself to be no bigger than a child&#x201D;.

                                    (<a href="#PROVENANCE"><i>Provenance</i></a>, above). 
                                    As <span class="persName-JBOTTOMS">Janet Bottoms</span> defines this taste, Romantics like <span class="persName-CLE">Lamb</span> and <span class="persName-STC">Coleridge</span> tended to look backward nostalgically to their own childhoods for examples of imaginative engagement. 
                                    For them, traditional tales escaped the confines of &#x201C;the social limits and moral laws of the familiar world&#x201D;&#x2014;the boundaries within which the educationists 
                                    aimed to socialize the child subject. The old &#x201C;wild&#x201D; tales, rather, &#x201C;developed in unpredictable ways, rewarding hero or heroine with honours and wealth&#x201D;; and instead of &#x201C;foregrounding actual children&#x201D; as subjects, 
                                    encouraged identification with (in <span class="persName-STC">Coleridge</span>&#x02BC;s description) &#x201C;excessive smallness combined with great power&#x201D;, thus &#x201C;exhibiting, through the working of the imagination, the idea of power in the will&#x201D;. 
                                    Such tales as the <span class="title-story-ARABIANNIGHTS">Arabian Nights</span>, <span class="persName-STC">Coleridge</span> emphasizes, &#x201C;cause no deep feeling of a moral kind&#x2014;whether of religion or love; but an impulse of motion is communicated to the mind without excitement, 
                                    and this is the reason of their being so generally read and admired&#x201D;

                                    as an example of plain language that &#x201C;can excite thought or feeling in the Reader&#x201D;, suggestive of <span class="persName-STC">Coleridge</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;impulse of motion . . . communicated to the mind&#x201D; 
                                    (<span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span>, <span class="title-book-WORDSWORTHPROSEWORKS"><i>Prose Works</i></span> . . .). As <span class="persName-PCRAIN">Patricia Crain</span> remarks, however, 
                                    the tale is also invoked by <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span> (and by <span class="persName-CLE">Lamb</span> in <span class="title-essay-LAMBDREAMCHILDREN">&#x201C;Dream Children&#x201D;</span>)

                                    Through this approach to traditional tales, <span class="persName-PCRAIN">Crain</span> argues, Romantics such as <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span>, <span class="persName-STC">Coleridge</span>, and <span class="persName-CLE">Lamb</span>

                            In the first decade of <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s reading, the elder Ruskins&#x02BC; acquisition of books by <span class="persName-ALB">Letitia Barbauld</span> and <span class="persName-ME">Maria Edgeworth</span> reflect their familiarity 
                            with the concept of age&#x2010;appropriate texts, even though <span class="persName-JR">John</span> read above the age recommended for certain texts. At the same time, 
                            his parents chose, or he appropriated, texts that were not conceived for a child audience but contained features that appealed to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s imagination&#x2014;for example, 
                            <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-BYRONMANFRED"><i>Manfred</i></span> and <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY"><i>The Monastery</i></span> and <span class="title-book-SCOTTABBOT"><i>The Abbot</i></span>.</div>

                            sifted the book purchases from among the other items in &#x201C;Sundries&#x201D; and collected the titles in summary notes, which he divided by year of purchase and distributed throughout the edition,

                            In areas such as classical literature, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s purchases suggest that he was anticipating <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s tutoring in Latin and Greek. 
                            Acquisitions that seem above <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s reading level may have chosen by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> for his own and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s use,

                            Since his purpose in the <span class="title-manuscript-RFMS28">Account Book</span> was to record expenses, 
                            he categorized the items in &#x201C;Sundries&#x201D; by month of the year, not by the kinds of objects purchased. 
                            Accordingly, his abbreviated entries are frequently ambiguous or obscure, and educated guesswork is required 
                            to sort out authors&#x02BC; names and titles of books from what may have been the name of a tradesman 
                            or a person employed by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> or even a now unfamiliar name for a household item. 
                            Another caveat about <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s acquisitions is that we cannot know whether all the books he purchased were meant for <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span>. 
                            As cautioned in <a href="#PROVENANCE">Provenance</a>, some acquisitions could have been intended as gifts for relatives.

                                            although collected sets in octavo, 12mo, or 18mo could be acquired for less (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#MILLGATESCOTTSLASTEDITION" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-JMILLGATE">Millgate</span>, <span class="title-book-MILLGATESCOTTSLASTEDITION"><i>Scott&#x02BC;s Last Edition</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 1&#x2013;13).

                                            A seven&#x2010;volume edition of the novel formed part of the fifty&#x2010;volume British Novels series, edited with prefaces on the novels by <span class="persName-ALB">Letitia Barbauld</span>. 
                                            First published in <span class="date-1810">1810</span>, the set was reissued by a consortium of publishers in <span class="date-1824">1824</span>, when an advertisement made a point of offering 
                                            <span class="title-book-RICHARDSONGRANDISON"><i>Sir Charles Grandison</i></span> separately from the set at 1&#x00A3; 11s 6d (&#x201C;British Novelists.&#x2014;A New Edition&#x201D;). 
                                            This reissue was probably intended to compete against another set of novels, which completed publication in <span class="date-1824">1824</span>, 
                                            and which likewise included <span class="persName-SRICHARDSON">Richardson</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-RICHARDSONGRANDISON"><i>Grandison</i></span>&#x2014;the Novelist&#x02BC;s Library (1821&#x2013;24), 
                                            edited with prefaces by Walter Scott, and sold by Hurst, Robinson and Co. 
                                            Of the final volumes of this series, which were issued in 1824, three thick volumes (vols. 6&#x2013;8) were devoted 
                                            respectively to the three Richardson novels&#x2014;Pamela, Clarissa, and Sir Charles Grandison 
                                            (Gossman, Spreading the Word, 48&#x2013;49). 
                                            Separated out as set, the three &#x201C;Novels of Richardson&#x201D; volumes were advertised in 1824 at 4&#x0026; 4s in boards 
                                            (&#x201C;Ballantyne&#x02BC;s Novelist&#x02BC;s Library&#x201D;). 
                                            John James&#x2014;probably thinking that the stories involving seduction in Pamela and Clarissa should not be allowed into the household&#x2014;may

                                            Whatever its origin, the Ruskins&#x02BC; acquisition of Sir Charles Grandison reflected a minor Richardson revival.</li>

                                    The responsibility for and circumstances of binding these three items as &#x201C;Fairy Tales&#x201D; are unknown. 
                                    This title on the spine applies most legitimately to the first of the items, <span class="title-anthology-MOTHERBUNCHSFAIRYTALES"><i>Mother Bunch&#x02BC;s Fairy Tales</i></span>, 
                                    whereas the other two items belong only marginally, each containing just one or two stories that feature a fairy or fantastical events. 
                                    Regardless of the consistency of the collection, however, an implicit rationale becomes apparent by comparing the contents of another bound collection, 
                                    <a href="#WIDOWDISCUSSION"><span class="title-binding_slipcase-WIDOWOFROSENEATHCOMP">&#x005B;The Widow of Roseneath etc.&#x005D;</span></a>, 
                                    which appears to be a complementary volume.&#x003C;br/&#x003E;&#x003C;br/&#x003E;
                                    
                                    Besides their contents, the three items in <span class="title-binding_slipcase-FAIRYTALESSHARPCOLL">&#x201C;Fairy Tales&#x201D;</span> also notably have in common their publication by J. Lumsden and Son of Glasgow. 
                                    Now highly regarded among collectors, Lumsden&#x02BC;s children&#x02BC;s books are distinguished by 
                                    &#x201C;a certain trimness (primness one might almost call it) in the covers, the quality of the paper used, 
                                    the excellent type&#x2010;face, the occasional use of coloured inks for text and illustrations, 
                                    usually bistre or sanguine, occasionally green, and a few hand&#x2010;coloured illustrations&#x201D;. 
                                    In their own time, however, the books were apparently little known outside of <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>; 
                                    and even in their own country, they were not widely popular, because their prices were considered 
                                    rather dear, even at two pence or six pence per copy&#x2014;cheaper and less elegant chapbooks by this publisher 
                                    being more commonly found

                                            The Lumsden edition was a piracy and abridgement of an English edition

                                            and the Harris editions were in turn based on editions (ca. <span class="date-1773-1799">1773&#x2013;99</span>) published by the firm of John Newbery 
                                            (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#BLAMIRESMOTHERBUNCH" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-DBLAMIRES">Blamires</span>, <span class="title-essay-BLAMIRESMOTHERBUNCH">&#x201C;From Madame d&#x02BC;Aulnoy to Mother Bunch&#x201D;</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 75; and see

                                          Newbery originated the title, <span class="title-anthology-MOTHERBUNCHSFAIRYTALES"><i>Mother Bunch&#x02BC;s Fairy Tales</i></span>, and adapted an earlier English translation 
                                            (<span class="date-1721">1721</span>, reprinted frequently through <span class="date-1817">1817</span>, and including tales by other French salon writers). 
                                            This early eighteenth&#x2010;century English translation, according to <span class="persName-DBLAMIRES">David Blamires</span>, 
                                            was faithful to the original, sophisticated French tales and intended for adult readers. 
                                            The Newbery edition and its descendents simplified the texts for child readers, 
                                            and reassigned the authorship from <span class="persName-COUNTESSDAULNOY">Madame d&#x02BC;Aulnoy</span> to the fictitious Mother Bunch, 
                                            an English folklore figure whom children could imagine as a storyteller 
                                            similar to Mother Goose. Through these successive adaptations of the English texts 
                                            by Newbery, Harris, and Lumsden for an audience of middle&#x2010;class children&#x2014;as well as 
                                            through issues of individual tales in chapbook form for a working&#x2010;class audience&#x2014;the 
                                            French salon fairy tales came be regarded as English and traditional

                                            the specification that the tales were meant to amuse &#x201C;little masters and misses&#x201D; signals that the tales 
                                            were meant for younger children. For Newbery in the eighteenth century, the purpose of such books was 
                                            to teach children basic reading, as compared with books designated for &#x201C;young gentlemen and ladies&#x201D;,

                                            As pointed out in the &#x201C;Introductory Essay&#x201D; on the copy in the <span class="title-archive-SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALESHOCKLIFFE">Hockliffe Archive</span>, 
                                            the tales have no connection with Christmas, despite the anthology&#x02BC;s title, which presumably was a marketing ploy. 
                                            The text, which in some copies includes a description of the Seven Wonders of the World, 
                                            was apparently based on a collection first published in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, ca. <span class="date-1780">1780</span> 
                                            (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALESHOCKLIFFE" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-archive-SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALESHOCKLIFFE">&#x201C;Stories before 1850. 0220: Anon. &#x005B;&#x2018;Solomon Sobersides&#x2019;&#x005D;, Christmas Tales&#x201D;</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;).&#x003C;br/&#x003E;&#x003C;br/&#x003E; 
                                            
                                            The first story in the collection opens with commentary on the neglect of religion and morality in childhood education, 
                                            but the stories in themselves do little to redress this supposed failing. The collection is miscellaneous, 
                                            some tales teaching prudent and moral conduct, some adopting an oriental flavor, and only a few entailing magic or fairies. 
                                            Two of the latter sort feature dervises (i.e., dervishes), who reward hospitality with magical riches, but retract the reward and punish 
                                            characters who overstep boundaries owing to greed or excess curiosity.&#x003C;br/&#x003E;&#x003C;br/&#x003E;

                                    The responsibility for binding these items together is unknown. Although not stated explicitly, <span class="persName-HGV">Helen Viljoen</span>&#x02BC;s description in the exhibition catalogue, 
                                    &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#VILJOENRUSKINSBACKGROUNDS" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-catalogue-VILJOENRUSKINSBACKGROUNDS"><i>Ruskin&#x02BC;s Backgrounds, Friendships, and Interests</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E; suggests 
                                    that the binding was present when received from the collector, <span class="persName-FJS">F. J. Sharp</span> (pp. 6&#x2013;7 &#x005B;item 5.<i>a</i>&#x005D;). <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> appears to believe that the binding was present even when &#x201C;given to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> by his <span class="persName-JJR">Father</span>&#x201C;, 
                                    but it is unlikely that such disparate items would have been bound together originally.&#x003C;br/&#x003E;&#x003C;br/&#x003E;
                                    
                                    A rationale, if not the specific occasion for the collection 
                                    can be inferred, however, if the binding of these eight items was made in concert with the binding of <a href="#FAIRYTALESDISCUSSION">Fairy Tales</a>. 
                                    As compared with the latter, the items collected here share an emphasis on &#x201C;cautionary&#x201D; tales (to draw on the subtitle of <span class="title-book-TURNERTHECOWSLIP"><i>The Cowslip</i></span>). 
                                    Since the early nineteenth century, such Romantic writers as <span class="persName-CLE">Charles Lamb</span>, <span class="persName-STC">S. T. Coleridge</span>, and <span class="persName-WW">William Wordsworth</span> 
                                    had polemically argued in favor of appealing to children&#x02BC;s imagination with fairy tales as opposed to training their reason and morals 
                                    with &#x201C;instructive&#x201D; and &#x201C;cautionary&#x201D; tales and dialogues by the &#x201C;cursed <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span> Crew&#x201D;, as <span class="persName-CLE">Lamb</span> anathematized this group largely of women writers. 
                                    In our time, critics have exposed the politics underpinning these divisions, but in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, 
                                    which was probably when these two collections of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s books were bound, the reputation of 
                                    <span class="persName-ALB">Anna Letitia Barbauld</span> had been disassociated from her politics and reduced to bland high&#x2010;mindedness&#x2014;a &#x201C;valuation&#x201D; 
                                    of this writing that suggests, as <span class="persName-WMCCARTHY">William McCarthy</span> complains, &#x201C;that it entirely lacked humor, irony, or wit&#x201D; 
                                    (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#MCCARTHYBARBAULDRECEPTION" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-WMCCARTHY">McCarthy</span>, <span class="title-essay-MCCARTHYBARBAULDRECEPTION">&#x201C;&#x2018;A High&#x2010;Minded Christian Lady&#x2019;&#x201D;</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 179; and see

                                    Such a valuation was perhaps implicitly placed on these eight items by binding them together.&#x003C;br/&#x003E;&#x003C;br/&#x003E;
                                    
                                    The reductive valuation may not have been <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s, but it seems unlikely that he could have been responsible for binding this collection 
                                    since, as noted in the following descriptions, he annotated some of the items separately, 
                                    bequeathing them to <span class="persName-JSAR">Joan Severn</span> and her children. One of the annotations is dated &#x201C;<span class="date-1889">1889</span>&#x201D;, and another &#x201C;<span class="date-1889-1890">1889&#x2013;1890</span>&#x201D;, 
                                    clues that the binding was ordered after <span class="date-1890">1890</span> by someone other than <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x2014;perhaps by <span class="persName-JSAR">Joan Severn</span>&#x2014;since by that time, 
                                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself would not have been in a mental state to take such an initiative.

                                    English collections of <span class="persName-AESOP">Aesop</span>&#x02BC;s fables did appeal across age groups and were accessible across class boundaries. 
                                    The original adult readers of the <span class="date-1722">1722</span> translation by <span class="persName-SCROXALL">Samuel Croxall</span> (<span class="date-1688-1752">1688/89&#x2013;1752</span>) 
                                    would have understood his lengthy &#x201C;instructive applications&#x201D; appended to each fable as whiggish ripostes 
                                    to the Jacobite <span class="title-anthology-LESTRANGEFABLES"><i>Fables of Aesop and Other Eminent Mythologists</i></span> 
                                    (<span class="date-1691">1691</span>, <span class="date-1699">1699</span>) by <span class="persName-RLESTRANGE">Sir Roger L&#x02BC;Estrange</span> (<span class="date-1616-1704">1616&#x2013;1704</span>). Notwithstanding their political applications, 
                                    both translators presented their fables as appropriate reading also for children, just as <span class="persName-JLOCKE">John Locke</span> (<span class="date-1632-1704">1632&#x2013;1704</span>) 
                                    considered &#x201C;<span class="persName-AESOP">Aesop</span>&#x02BC;s Fables . . . the best . . . Stories apt to delight and entertain a Child&#x201D;, while the stories &#x201C;may yet
                                    afford useful Reflections to a grown Man; and if his Memory retain them all his Life after, he will not repent to find them there, among his manly Thoughts&#x201D;. 
                                    In <span class="date-1703">1703</span>, <span class="persName-JLOCKE">Locke</span> produced his own interlinear Latin and English version of <span class="persName-AESOP">Aesop</span> as a scheme for teaching children language 
                                    (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#LEWISENGLISHFABLE" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-JEL">Lewis</span>, <span class="title-book-LEWISENGLISHFABLE"><i>The English Fable</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 20, 25&#x2013;26, 40; <span class="persName-JLOCKE">Locke</span>, to come). 
                                    Thus, while we do not know exactly when (in <span class="date-1811">1811</span> or afterward) <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> acquired <span class="persName-SCROXALL">Croxall</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-anthology-CROXALLFABLESOFAESOP"><i>Aesop</i></span> or for what purpose, 
                                    he may have conceived of the book both as edification for himself 
                                    and as basic instruction in reading and grammar, as well as morality, for a child.&#x003C;br/&#x003E;&#x003C;br/&#x003E;
                                    
                                    In the <span class="date-1700-1799">eighteenth century</span>, according to Stephen H. Daniel, the taste for fable collections with political agendas 
                                    like <span class="persName-RLESTRANGE">L&#x02BC;Estrange</span>&#x02BC;s and <span class="persName-SCROXALL">Croxall</span>&#x02BC;s declined in favor of versions deemed appropriate to child readers,

                                    Nonetheless, <span class="persName-SCROXALL">Croxall</span>&#x02BC;s collection maintained its grip long into the next century, 
                                    perhaps because its anti&#x2010;Jacobite posture was deemed a safe choice for the early Victorian household  
                                    (although another youth in <span class="placeName-CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</span>, <span class="persName-RB">Robert Browning</span>, was &#x201C;affected . . . so painfully&#x201D;

                                    and might be exposed to versions of <span class="title-anthology-LESTRANGEFABLES">Aesop</span> like <span class="persName-">L&#x02BC;Estrange&#x02BC;</span>s, which likewise claimed to be intended for &#x201C;the Use and Instruction of Children;

                                            It is not likely that this copy was used by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in boyhood, although the collector who obtained it, &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/sharp_f_j_note" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-FJS">F.

                                            a holograph note in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s mature hand, this is a single&#x2010;volume edition of <span class="title-lesson-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span> (vi&#x002B;479 pp.), whereas the edition that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> preserved as his boyhood copy was divided into six separate volumes. 
                                            That number of volumes is documented by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in a <span class="title-letter-jr_to_simpsonandco_1885-02-04"><span class="date-1885-02-04">4 February 1885</span> letter to Simpson &#x0026; Co.</span>, arranging to rebind three of the volumes remaining from his boyhood set, 
                                            emphasizing that his youthful markings were to be retained, and to number the volumes 1, 2, and 3, since he had &#x201C;lost the rest&#x201D; of the volumes (quoted in &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span>, <span class="title-book-DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><i>Library of John Ruskin</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 8 &#x005B;no. 34&#x005D;). 
                                            The remaining volumes sent for binding would have been the original volumes 1, 2, and 5, with volumes 3, 4, and 6 gone missing, 
                                            according to details in an <span class="date-1868">1868</span> partial catalogue of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s books, as cited by <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span>. On this evidence, 
                                            <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span> suggests that, since the <span class="persName-FJS">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> copy at the <span class="placeName-building-BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke Library</span> &#x201C;is not bound in the style specified in the letter to Simpson &#x0026; Co.&#x201D;, this volume 
                                            &#x201C;may be one of the volumes which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> mentioned he had lost&#x201D; (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-book-DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><i>Library of John Ruskin</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 8 &#x005B;no. 34&#x005D;, and see cviii&#x2013;cxii). 
                                            This possibility is ruled out, however, since the <span class="persName-FJS">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> copy, which is a six&#x2010;volumes&#x2010;in&#x2010;one edition, complete in itself, cannot have formed a part of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s original set.&#x003C;br/&#x003E;&#x003C;br/&#x003E;
                                    
                                    <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span> gives <span class="date-1792">1792</span> as the year of publication for the <span class="persName-FJS">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> copy, but this date is not supported by the title page, which is undated. 
                                            Its publication by J. F. Dove places it, rather, as a reprint in a series conceived by <span class="persName-JFDOVE">John Fowler Dove</span> (<span class="date-1787-1866">1787&#x2013;1866</span>), <span class="placeName-building-STJOHNSQLONDON">St. John&#x02BC;s Square</span>, <span class="placeName-building-CLERKENWELL">Clerkenwell</span>, <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>.

                                            (see &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/annuals_note#COLLECTEDEDITIONS" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;Annuals and Other Illustrated Books: Collected Editions&#x003C;/a&#x003E;). 
                                            At first, Dove produced these reprints as &#x201C;Printed for the Proprietors of the English Classics by J. F. Dove&#x201D;&#x2014;the &#x201C;proprietors&#x201D; being comprised of 
                                            a long list of publishers, including &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/smith_elder_note" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;Smith, Elder &#x0026; Co.&#x003C;/a&#x003E; from the time when that firm was located on <span class="placeName-building-FENCHURCHST">Fenchurch Street</span>. 
                                            Two books in the <span class="title-series-DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">&#x201C;English Classics&#x201D;</span> series, which may well have been acquired through Smith, Elder, held an important place in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s boyhood library, 
                                            his <span class="date-1824">1824</span> copy of <span class="persName-APOPE">Pope</span>&#x02BC;s translation of the <span class="title-poem-HOMERILIADTRANSPOPE"><i>Iliad</i></span>, and his <span class="date-1825">1825</span> copy of <span class="persName-JDRYDEN">Dryden</span>&#x02BC;s translation of the <span class="title-poem-VIRGILAENEID"><i>Aeneid</i></span> and other works.

                                            since <span class="persName-JAIKIN">Aikin</span> and <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>&#x02BC;s tales and dialogues perceptively influenced some of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s earliest extant juvenilia from <span class="date-1826">1826</span> (see, e.g.,

                                            According to <span class="persName-LWORMS">Laurence Worms</span>, this imprint took the place of the &#x201C;Printed for the Proprietors of English Classics&#x201D;

                                            The textual history of <span class="title-lesson-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span> does bear consequences for what edition <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> first used. 
                                            In an analysis of the publishing history of the book, <span class="persName-AFYFE">Aileen Fyfe</span> explains that, <span class="date-1792-1823">from 1792 until 1823</span>, the text of the first edition was controlled by the first publisher, <span class="persName-JJPUBLISHER">Joseph Johnson</span>, 
                                            his successor Rowland Hunter, and other publishers to whom Hunter sold shares. In <span class="date-1823">1823</span>, to maintain copyright, the shareholders solicited 
                                            a corrected and slightly expanded edition from <span class="persName-JAIKIN">John Aikin</span>&#x02BC;s son, <span class="persName-AAIKIN">Arthur Aikin</span>, which was published as the thirteenth edition, apparently in six volumes; 
                                            and in <span class="date-1826">1826</span>, an edition rearranged by <span class="persName-JAIKIN">John Aikin</span>&#x02BC;s daughter, <span class="persName-LAIKIN">Lucy Aikin</span>, was published in four volumes. Despite these new editions descending from the original,
                                            &#x201C;from the <span class="date-1823-1826">mid&#x2010;1820s</span>&#x201D;, <span class="persName-AFYFE">Fyfe</span> notes, &#x201C;any publisher could print the original text of <span class="title-book-AIKENBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span>, and a number did so&#x201D;, including 
                                            provincial and Scottish publishers (<span class="persName-AFYFE">Fyfe</span>, <span class="title-essay-FYFECOPYRIGHTS">&#x201C;Copyrights and Competition&#x201D;</span>, 40). If <span class="persName-JFDOVE">Dove</span> waited until <span class="date-1827">1827</span> to reprint <span class="title-lesson-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings</i></span>, even in its original text,

                                            The Ruskins would have entered the market for <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s initial copy of <span class="title-lesson-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span> 
                                            during the transitional period in the book&#x02BC;s publishing history, between the <span class="date-1820-1826">early&#x2010; and mid&#x2010;1820s</span>, when the Aikins were revising the text in order to extend copyright, 
                                            and when other publishers were issuing reprints of the first edition. At this point, the Ruskins would likely have acquired either the new edition of <span class="date-1823">1823</span>, 
                                            whose shareholder publishers included (since <span class="date-1815">1815</span>) Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy, who also published the Ruskins&#x02BC; editions of <span class="persName-ME">Maria Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-series-EDGEWORTHEARLYLESSONS">&#x201C;Early Lessons&#x201D;</span> series; 
                                            or they would have purchased a first&#x2010;edition reprint available from non&#x2010;shareholder publishers. At that time, those non&#x2010;shareholder reprints 
                                            would not have included <span class="persName-JFDOVE">Dove</span>&#x02BC;s, since, as we have seen, evidence shows him coming late to the game. Consequently, putting aside the <span class="persName-FJS">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> <span class="persName-JFDOVE">Dove</span> edition&#x2014;undated, but probably after <span class="date-1827">1827</span>&#x2014;we 
                                            cannot determine what state of the text of <span class="title-lesson-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span> was availble to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in his boyhood six&#x2010;volume version, whether the revised edition by <span class="persName-AAIKIN">Arthur Aikin</span> or the original descended from the <span class="persName-JJPUBLISHER">Johnson</span>/Hunter shareholders (or even as originally published by <span class="persName-JJPUBLISHER">Johnson</span>/Hunter). 
                                            A good bet may be the revised text of <span class="date-1823">1823</span>, since the shareholders carrying that text, including Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy, produced substantial print runs that sold well 
                                                (see &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#FYFECOPYRIGHTS" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-AFYFE">Fyfe</span>, <span class="title-essay-FYFECOPYRIGHTS">&#x201C;Copyrights and Competition&#x201D;</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 43); and the Ruskins were familiar with Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy 
                                                from their purchase of <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHFRANK"><i>Frank</i></span> and <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span>. 
                                                Definitive evidence, however, must await recovery of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s three stray volumes, as rebound by Simpson.&#x003C;br/&#x003E;&#x003C;br/&#x003E;
                                            
                                            As for the <span class="persName-FJS">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> copy, given that it contains annotations by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> from later years, a plausible explanation may be that he acquired this <span class="persName-JFDOVE">Dove</span> edition at some point to replace the missing volumes of his boyhood set, 
                                            at or before the time of sending the surviving copies for rebinding; or, if the <span class="persName-JFDOVE">Dove</span> reprint was a more youthful acquisition, it should be treated as an additional household copy, circa <span class="date-1830">1830</span>. 
                                            While the front endpaper contains illegible scrawls, one of which <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> was tempted to make out to be the letter <i>J</i> and interpret as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s earliest signature,

                                            is consistent with their care to provide <span class="persName-JR">John</span> with other works in this list &#x201C;founded on facts&#x201D;. At the same time, their acquisition of this particular historical novel invites the possibility 
                                            that the Ruskins witnessed its popular musical stage adaptation, the &#x201C;melodramatic opera&#x201D; <span class="title-opera-MAZZINGHIEXILE"><i>The Exile</i></span>, 
                                            dramatized by <span class="persName-FR">Frederick Reynolds</span> (<span class="date-1764-1841">1764&#x2013;1841</span>) and scored by <span class="persName-JMAZZINGHI">Joseph Mazzinghi</span> (<span class="date-1765-1844">1765&#x2013;1844</span>).&#x003C;br/&#x003E;&#x003C;br/&#x003E;
                                            
                                            The facts of the tale derive from the heroism of a Russian girl, <span class="persName-PLUPOLOVA">Praskov&#x02BC;ia Lupolova</span>, whose father had been unjustly exiled to <span class="placeName-SIBERIA">Siberia</span>. 
                                            In <span class="date-1803">1803</span>, to correct the injustice and reverse her family&#x02BC;s exile, the twenty&#x2010;year&#x2010;old girl journeyed on foot from <span class="placeName-ISHIM">Ishim</span> in the <span class="placeName-TYUMENOBLAST">Tyumen Oblast</span> of western <span class="placeName-SIBERIA">Siberia</span> to <span class="placeName-STPETERSBURG">St. Petersburg</span>, 
                                            where she was able gain the sympathy of nobles who interceded to petition a pardon from <span class="persName-TA1">Czar Alexander I</span>. 
                                            In <span class="title-book-COTTINELIZABETH"><i>Élizabeth; ou, Les Exil&#x00E9;s de Sib&#x00E9;rie</i></span> (<span class="date-1806">1806</span>),

                                            and at the end of her ordeal brought her into the midst of <span class="persName-TA1">Alexander</span>&#x02BC;s coronation in <span class="placeName-building-MOSCOWCATHEDRAL">Moscow Cathedral</span>, where the girl dramatically interrupts the ceremony in order to plead her case. 
                                            In this telling, it is a young Siberian noble who intervenes and helps convince the <span class="persName-TA1">czar</span>, thus winning <span class="persName-fictional-ELIZABETH">Élizabeth</span>&#x02BC;s hand in marriage along with her father&#x02BC;s pardon. 
                                            The novel was translated into English in <span class="date-1808">1808</span>, influencing a generation with its clich&#x00E9;d depiction of <span class="placeName-RUSSIA">Russia</span>

                                            tale was quickly adapted for the stage.

                                            the aspect of spectacle was further elaborated by stage designers, who included <span class="persName-DRP">David Roberts</span>, with an emphasis on authenticity of representation. 
                                            The <span class="persName-TA1">czar</span>&#x02BC;s coronation was replaced by the crowning of <span class="persName-fictional-ELIZABETH">Empress Elizabeth Petrovna</span>, an event that was simultaneously widely circulated in pictorial print culture. 
                                            The emphasis on authenticity was regarded as educational as well as spectacular, and associations with the <span class="date-1821">1821</span> British coronation of <span class="persName-KG4">George IV</span> added patriotism to the appeal

                                            is valuable as a clue to the approximate date when he acquired this text. While <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> first took up a pen to write in ink around <span class="date-1827-04">April 1827</span>, 
                                            prior to this development he had already transitioned from a print to cursive hand, using a pencil, at least for rough draft. A reasonable guess, then, 
                                            for his acquisition and first reading of <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><i>Frank: A Sequel</i></span> is on or around his eighth birthday in <span class="date-1827-02">February 1827</span>, 
                                            an age in keeping with that of the eponymous hero. As <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span> specifies in the preface: &#x201C;The following volumes contain the History of <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> from seven years old, 
                                            where we left him &#x005B;in Frank, part 4&#x005D;, till between ten and eleven&#x201D; (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>, <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><i>Frank: A Sequel</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, x;

                                            While <span class="persName-HJV">Viljoen</span> respectfully conveyed <span class="persName-FJS">Sharp</span>&#x02BC;s conjecture, she must have realized that <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> cannot be the subject of the sketch,

                                            but his resulting drawing shows, as his cousin, <span class="persName-MARYME">Mary</span>, remarks, &#x201C;some of the rooms . . . larger than they were in reality, and some smaller&#x201D;, 
                                            plus he &#x201C;&#x2018;forgot the stairs&#x2019;&#x201D; altogether&#x2014;an omission that is pointedly corrected in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s floor plan on the volume&#x02BC;s endpaper, 
                                            regardless of what structure he intended the drawing to schematize. In the tale, 
                                            the <span class="persName-fictional-ENGINEERME">Engineer</span> instructs <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> to make proper measurements of the rooms and draw the floor plan to scale, 
                                            so that, by the end of the episode, <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;plan of his house was now tolerably neatly finished; 
                                            and this time the staircase was not forgotten; the breakfast room was not robbed to make space for the passage, 
                                            and the library was of its just length, and, as <span class="persName-fictional-MARYME">Mary</span> observed, none of the rooms were too large or too small&#x2014;all 
                                            were like reality. &#x2018;And now&#x2019;, said <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span>, &#x005B;&#x2018;&#x005D;that I know how to draw by a scale,

                                            The caption refers to a British Post Office packet, the <span class="name--LADYHOBART">Lady Hobart</span>,

                                            While sailing from <span class="placeName-HALIFAX">Halifax</span> to <span class="placeName-FALMOUTH">Falmouth</span>, the <span class="name--LADYHOBART">Lady Hobart</span> was pursued by a French schooner. Firing on the schooner, 
                                            the British boarded the ship and captured its crew, which were soon thereafter transferred as prisoners of war to two English schooners nearby. 
                                            British naval officers took possession of the French ship, and the <span class="name--LADYHOBART">Lady Hobart</span> continued on its way, carrying the French captain and his nephew. 
                                            On <span class="date-1803-06-28">June 28</span>, on a foggy night, the ship collided with a huge iceberg and rapidly sank. Twenty&#x2010;nine surviors filled two small boats carried by the packet, 
                                            including the captain, <span class="persName-WDF">William Dorset Fellowes</span> (<span class="date-1769-1852">1769&#x2013;1852</span>), the French captain, three women (one of them <span class="persName-WDF">Fellowes</span>&#x02BC;s spouse), and seamen. 
                                            The boats carried few provisions, and for seven days the castaways suffered from exposure, hunger, and thirst, 
                                            causing the French commander in a delirium to throw himself into the sea and drown. Nearing the Canadian coast, the boats were rescued on <span class="date-1803-07-04">4 July</span>. 
                                            <span class="persName-WDF">Fellowes</span> published an account of the ordeal, <span class="title-book-FELLOWESNARRATIVE"><i>A Narrative of the Loss of His Majesty&#x02BC;s Packet, the Lady Hobart</i></span>. 
                                            Various editions of the narrative included a foldout frontispiece depicting the disaster, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have copied for his drawing. 
                                            A scene of the disaster was also depicted the <span class="placeName-BRISTOL">Bristol</span> marine painter, <span class="persName-NPOCOCK">Nicholas Pocock</span> (<span class="date-1740-1821">1740&#x2013;1821</span>), and engraved by <span class="persName-RPOLLARD">Robert Pollard</span> (<span class="date-1755-1839">1755/56&#x2013;1839</span>)

                                    <i>Plot summary</i>. <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Little Jack</span> is a foundling adopted by an <span class="persName-fictional-OLDMANTD">old man</span>, formerly a soldier, and now living on a &#x201C;wide uncultivated moor&#x201D; 
                                            where he has built a hut and grows his own vegetables (p. 3). Although poor, he is content, having &#x201C;&#x2018;avoided, perhaps, many faults, 
                                            and much uneasiness, which I should have incurred had I been in another situation&#x201D; (p. 19). He owns &#x201C;one domestic&#x201D; and &#x201C;friend&#x201D; (pp. 4&#x2013;5), a goat named <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLENANTD">Little Nan</span>, 
                                            which he rescued as a kid. Finding the infant likewise abandoned on the moor, the <span class="persName-fictional-OLDMANTD">old man</span> trusts &#x201C;Providence which feeds the birds of the wood 
                                            and the beasts of the field, and which has promised to bless all those that are kind and charitable&#x201D; (p. 6). So it is that <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLENANTD">Nan</span>, 
                                            having &#x201C;lost her kid&#x201D;, willingly suckles the infant, &#x201C;seem&#x005B;ing&#x005D; to adopt him with equal tenderness as her offspring&#x201D; (pp. 7, 8). 
                                            &#x201C;&#x2018;Who knows&#x2019;&#x201D;, concludes the <span class="persName-fictional-OLDMANTD">old man</span>, &#x201C;&#x2018;but Providence, which has preserved this child in so wonderful a manner, 
                                            may have destined it to something equally wonderful in its future life; and may bless me as the humble agent of its decrees&#x2019;&#x201D; (p. 8).&#x003C;br/&#x003E;&#x003C;br/&#x003E;
                                            
                                            A Rousseauvian savage, <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Little Jack</span> is &#x201C;left to nature&#x201D; to grow; and since he is &#x201C;unfettered by bandages or restraints&#x201D; and wears &#x201C;neither shoes nor stockings, nor shirt&#x201D;, 
                                            &#x201C;his limbs&#x201D; attain &#x201C;their due proportions and form&#x201D; (pp. 9, 10). A lady passing in her carriage hears his story, and although she 
                                            &#x201C;had seen a great deal of the world, and had read a variety of books, it had never once entered into her head that a child might grow strong and vigorous by sucking a goat, 
                                            instead of eating pap&#x201D; (p. 14). She offers to take him in, but, <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> refusing, gives him money for shoes and stockings. <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> dutifully attempts to discharge the charity, 
                                            but finds the shoes so cumbersome that he uses the money to buy his &#x201C;daddy&#x201D; a warm coat instead.&#x003C;br/&#x003E;&#x003C;br/&#x003E;
                                    
                                    <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span>&#x02BC;s daddy teaches him only &#x201C;plain and simple morals and religion&#x201D;, so that, when <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLENANTD">Nan</span> dies, 
                                            <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> is &#x201C;not able to talk as finely about love, tenderness, and sensibility, as many other little boys, 
                                            that have enjoyed greater advantages of education&#x201D;. Nonetheless, like <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYTD">Harry Sandford</span> compared to <span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD">Tommy Merton</span>, 
                                            <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> feels &#x201C;the reality&#x201D; of such emotions &#x201C;in his heart, and thought it . . . natural to love every thing that loves us&#x201D; (p. 13). 
                                            <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> has one fault, however, of being &#x201C;a little too jealous of his honour&#x201D;, which he is able to defend with &#x201C;such dispositions for the art of boxing, 
                                            that he could beat every boy in the neighbourhood, of his age and size&#x201D; (pp. 16&#x2013;17). 
                                            (The plate showing <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> boxing with <span class="persName-fictional-TOMCOLLIERTD">Tom the Collier</span> is the only cut that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not outline on the reverse.)&#x003C;br/&#x003E;&#x003C;br/&#x003E;
                                            
                                            When <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> is twelve, the <span class="persName-fictional-OLDMANTD">old man</span> dies. In his grief, <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> desperately tries to restore warmth to the corpse by stripping naked and lying atop him. 
                                            A local farmer who is acquainted with <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> takes him in and teaches him farmwork, but the farmer dies as well. <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> resolutely sets out to find other means to support himself. 
                                            Chancing on an iron foundry, he is drawn to its warmth and shelter. The industry contrasts with his agrarian upbringing, but his straigtforward account of himself leads to a position. 
                                            Because he is incautiously open about his history, however, the other boys tease him, provoking <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> to frequent fistfights.
                                            
                                            One day, the foundry is toured by gentlemen and ladies. (The foundry processes are detailed sufficiently to form a brief example of the factory tour genre.) 
                                            The visit is interrupted by the disturbance of another fight, causing the master to threaten <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> with dismissal. 
                                            The foreman interjects how <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> is a dependable workman, and <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> stoutly defends his behavior, describing how the boys mock his strange upbringing. 
                                            While the visitors also cannot restrain their laughter at the story of <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLENAN">Nan</span>, the company happens to include the lady who had heard the story previously and given him money for shoes. 
                                            She once again offers to take <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> into service, and he accepts.
                                            
                                            &#x201C;Call him a little soldier, and <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> was at every one&#x02BC;s disposal. This was <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span>&#x02BC;s particular foible and vanity&#x201D;, imitating his daddy, the old soldier, 
                                            by &#x201C;poising a dung&#x2010;fork, charging with a broom&#x2010;stick, and standing sentry at the stable&#x2010;door&#x201D; (p. 31). He also developes an &#x201C;immoderate love of horses&#x201D; (p. 32); 
                                            and building on his experience at the foundry, learns some smithing, sadlery, and carpentry. His resourcefulnesss makes him useful and entertaining to his mistress&#x02BC;s orphaned nephew, 
                                            young <span class="persName-fictional-WILLETSTD">Master Willets</span>. Allowed to be on familiar terms with the boy, <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> listens to <span class="persName-WILLETSTD">Master Willets</span>&#x02BC;s lessons, and practices writing and studying on his own at night.
                                            
                                            This happiness comes to an end when <span class="persName-fictional-WILLETSTD">Master Willets</span> is visited by a young gentleman &#x201C;with a very great taste for finery, and a supreme contempt for all the vulgar&#x201D; (p. 37). 
                                            The gentleman of course cannot abide <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span>, and <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> resents the injury to his honor. Happening to acquire a monkey from a showman, <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> outfits the animal as a parody of the gentleman, 
                                            inciting the gentlemen to cruelly slay the monkey and receive a harmless indignity in return. <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> refuses to apologize, and his &#x201C;obstinacy&#x201D; leads to his dismissal (p. 42).
                                            
                                            Coming at last to his adoptive father&#x02BC;s profession, <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> enlists as a marine and is sent to <span class="placeName-INDIA">India</span>. While pausing to hunt on an island, <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> is separated from his party and loses his way. 
                                            Fearing to be treated by the natives &#x201C;as the white men generally treat the blacks when they get them into their possession&#x201D;, 
                                            <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> decides to survive on his own, content to be rid of anyone &#x201C;&#x2018;to quarrel with me, or baa, or laugh at my poor daddy and mammy &#x005B;<span class="persName-fictional-LITTLENANTD">Nan</span>&#x005D;&#x2019;&#x201D; (pp. 48&#x2013;49). 
                                            A brief Robinsonade ensues until <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> is rescued by an English ship, which carries him to <span class="placeName-INDIA">India</span>.
                                            
                                            <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> serves ably in <span class="placeName-INDIA">India</span>, but when his regiment marches within reach of the &#x201C;Tartars&#x201D;, he warns the officers to avoid these warriors&#x02BC; calvary skills. 
                                            His warnings are ignored, resulting in the army&#x02BC;s routing. <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> is taken among the hostages, though &#x201C;he alone, accustomed to all the vicissitudes of life, retain&#x005B;s&#x005D; his chearfulness, and &#x005B;is&#x005D; 
                                            prepared to meet every reverse of fortune&#x201D; (p. 56). The narrator supplies an anthropological account of the Tartars, preparing to show how <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> ingratiates himself by means of his  
                                            horsemanship. He draws on his smithing to introduce the Tartars to shoeing their horses, on his sadlery to improve the Tartars&#x02BC; gear, and on his regard for animals to train the Tartars&#x02BC; horses for docility without violence. 
                                            When the English negotiate freedom for the hostages, the Tartars present <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> with valuable presents. Returned to the English camp, he secures an honorable discharge.
                                            
                                            Back in <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>, <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> returns to the iron foundry as a foreman, and ends as a partner.

                                            and on the site of the <span class="persName-fictional-OLDMANTD">old man</span>&#x02BC;s hut he builds a &#x201C;small but convenient house&#x201D; where &#x201C;he would sometimes retire from business, and cultivate his garden with his own hands, 
                                            for he hated idleness&#x201D;. He now freely relates his history without fear of mockery, since &#x201C;it is of very little consequence how a man comes into the world, 
                                            provided he behaves well, and discharges his duty when he is in it&#x201D; (pp. 64, 65).

                                    No further indication appears in the family letters whether <span class="title-story-CHILDRENINTHEWOOD">&#x201C;Children of the Wood&#x201D;</span> was acquired or, if so, in what edition. The tale was widely familiar to child readers, but in starkly differing versions.&#x003C;br/&#x003E;&#x003C;br/&#x003E;
                                    
                                    The original ballad relates how a dying man and his wife commend their young son and daughter to the care of the man&#x02BC;s brother. 
                                    After a year of caring for the children, the uncle succumbs to the temptation to steal their inheritance, 
                                    and hires assassins to convey the children to a wood and murder them. 
                                    One of the would&#x2010;be killers has a change of heart and, to avert the deed, kills his partner, but then abandons the children 
                                    to die of starvation and exposure in the wood. Their bodies are covered with leaves by a robin.&#x003C;br/&#x003E;&#x003C;br/&#x003E;
                                    
                                    The ballad first appeared in print in <span class="date-1595">1595</span> and long held popular appeal in broadside form, 
                                    before becoming an object of antiquarian interest when included in
                                    <span class="title-anthology-PERCYRELIQUES"><i>Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</i></span> compiled by <span class="persName-TPERCY">Thomas Percy</span> (<span class="date-1765">1765</span>). 
                                    <span class="persName-PCRAIN">Patricia Crain</span> has traced the ballad&#x02BC;s &#x201C;life as a printed text and its migration from the ballad canon 
                                    to the children&#x02BC;s literature canon&#x201D; in the <span class="date-1767-1834">late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries</span>&#x2014;the 
                                    point at which <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> perceived the story as appropriate comfort for an ailing four year old. 
                                    As <span class="persName-PCRAIN">Crain</span> explains, these &#x201C;genre and format transformations&#x201D; from popular broadside to a children&#x02BC;s book 
                                    &#x201C;converse&#x005B;d&#x005D; and coordinate&#x005B;d&#x005D; with shifting views and valuations of children&#x02BC;s lives and deaths&#x201D;. 
                                    By <span class="date-1823">1823</span>, the texts and illustrations designed for child readers, 
                                    which would have been available to the Ruskins, included a prose revision by a pseudonymous <span class="persName-pen_name-CENGLISH">&#x201C;Clara English&#x201D;</span>,

                                    published by Darton and Harvey. In this version, the children&#x02BC;s death and avian burial are replaced by their 
                                    rescue and training for useful work in a utopian manufacturing town 
                                    (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#CRAINREADINGCHILDREN" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-PCRAIN">Crain</span>, <span class="title-book-CRAINREADINGCHILDREN"><i>Reading Children</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 44, 50&#x2013;51). In another prose version, presented as a &#x201C;continuation&#x201D; of the story, 
                                    <span class="title-book-PERFIDYDETECTED1814"><i>Perfidy Detected! or, The Children in the Wood Restored, by Honestas, the Hermit of the Forest</i></span> (<span class="date-1814">1814</span>), 
                                    the children wandering in the woods fall into the arms of a kindly hermit, who has retreated to the forest to mourn the abduction of his own children. 
                                    Not only are the children providentially discovered at the hermitage by their father, who is inexplicably alive; the hermit&#x02BC;s own lost daughters are revealed and reunited with their father, as well. 
                                    At the same time, the original story was preserved in a prose version published by <span class="persName-WDARTON">William Darton</span>,

                                    (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#ALISCHEHERAZADEINENGLAND" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-MJA">Ali</span>, <span class="title-book-ALISCHEHERAZADEINENGLAND"><i>Scheherazade in England</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 11). In the course of the century, 
                                    the <span class="title-story-SINBADTHESAILOR"><i>Sinbad</i></span> tales, like other favorite portions of the <span class="title-anthology-ARABIANNIGHTS"><i>Arabian Nights</i></span>, 
                                    became part of the popular literature that entertained children, though not intended specifically for them. 
                                    As <span class="persName-MOGRENBY">M. O. Grenby</span> characterizes the development of an English children&#x02BC;s canon, popular tales were not displaced by the new, <span class="date-1767-1799">late eighteenth&#x2010;century</span> literature devised especially for children, 
                                    but absorbed into it (<span class="persName-MOGRENBY">Grenby</span>, <span class="title-book-GRENBYCHILDREADER"><i>The Child Reader</i></span>, 111, and see 94, 96, 109).&#x003C;br/&#x003E;&#x003C;br/&#x003E;
                                    
                                    Such assimilation may have came about over the objections of writers with a more exclusive plan for children&#x2014;whether plans for practical education like the Edgeworths&#x02BC; 
                                    or for religious orthodoxy like <span class="persName-STRIMMER">Sarah Trimmer</span>&#x02BC;s&#x2014;but the Arabian Nights tales seem to have been allowed exceptional approval. 
                                    The objections by neoclassicists to the extravagance of Eastern tales were countered by positive comparisons 
                                    of the <span class="title-story-SINBADTHESAILOR">Sinbad</span> stories to Western classical literature, such as the voyages of <span class="persName-fictional-ULYSSES">Odysseus</span>
