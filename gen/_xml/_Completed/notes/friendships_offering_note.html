                                <span class="persName-LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</span>ʼs preface seems bent on covering all bases for the possible marketability of his attempt at this miscellaneous venue—to compete with Continental models (chiefly German) 
                                of the literary annual by translating the form to meet British taste; to supply the holiday gift market; to furnish (“independently”) both “graphic decorations” and “original contributions . . . from popular pens”; 
                                to “partially . . . supply” the features of a pocket‐book, thus incorporating yet “elevat[ing]” the function of this annual diary or “remembrancer”; 
                                and a purpose not mentioned directly by the competitors, to seize on the British pent‐up, post‐Napoleonic desire for travel, actual or virtual, by pairing engraved “views” of foreign cities with descriptions based on “personal observation”

                                attempting an appreciative critical history of the annuals when they had declined in popularity, <span class="persName-LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</span>ʼs early volumes 
                                were criticized for their weak contents and poor production and also their haphazard miscellaneity—“unpromising” assemblages of “indifferent views of Continental cities”, “poor verses”, 
                                and the occasional “tale by <span class="persName-AO">Mrs. Opie</span>” (i.e., <span class="persName-AO">Amelia Opie</span> [<span class="date-1769-1853">1769–1853</span>]). 
                                The writer particularly dwelled on the inclusion of “ruled pages for memoranda”, as typically found in a pocket‐book, as the proof of unconsidered paste‐up, 
                                a feature that the writer condemned likewise in the <span class="title-annual-FRIENSHIPSOFFERING">Offering</span>ʼs early rivals, <span class="title-annual-FORGETMENOT"><i>Forget Me Not</i></span> and <span class="title-annual-GRACES"><i>The Graces</i></span>

                                In the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>, however, reviews of Relfeʼs early volumes suggest that critics embraced the miscellany.

                                and flowers of literature with the utility of the superior class of pocket‐books, and in this . . .  he has in a great degree succeeded”—adding parenthetically, not that <span class="persName-LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</span> should have aimed at greater uniformity of purpose, 
                                but that he might have made up for “the deficiency of an almanack”, although admittedly that addition “would have necessarily much increased the price”

In the view of the <span class="title-periodical-MIRROROFLITERATURE"><i>Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction</i></span>, Relfeʼs second volume of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1825"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i> (<span class="date-1825">1825</span>)</span> 
                                had “much improved since last year” since it offered more, not less, variety of contents: “nearly three hundred pages of interesting articles in prose and verse; 
                                a Diary, with views at the head of each month [i.e., what the <span class="title-periodical-GENTLEMANSMAGAZINE"><i>Gentlemanʼs Magazine</i></span> described as “a blank Diary for memoranda, headed by 12 very neat wood engravings of ancient castles, churches, &c., all in the county of <span class="placeName-KENT">Kent</span>”], 
                                and fourteen copper plate engravings, including four sweet views of the cities of <span class="placeName-STPETERSBURG">St. Petersburgh</span>, <span class="placeName-CONSTANTINOPLE">Constantinople</span>, <span class="placeName-BERNE">Berne</span>, and <span class="placeName-NAPLES">Naples</span>”; 
                                and rounding out the “literary department”, “some original music, and several enigmas, riddles, and rebuses”

                        <div class="p">According to the <span class="date-1858">1858</span> <span class="title-periodical-BOOKSELLER"><i>Bookseller</i></span> article, the fortunes of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> were turned around by 
                                by the editorship of <span class="persName-TKH">T. K. Hervey</span> (<span class="date-1799-1859">1799–1859</span>). In his prefatory remarks for Relfeʼs <span class="date-1826">1826</span> volume, <span class="persName-TKH">Hervey</span> announced “a view to an entire change in . . . [the annualʼs] character and plan”, 
                                by shifting emphasis from the transience of an annual to the permanence of a keepsake: the “alterations” were to “consist in the removal of all those features which marked it as more peculiarly adapted for one season of the year than another”. 
                                Starting with that volume, the almanac and pocket‐book features were suppressed, and the subtitle shortened to “A Literary Album” to signal the concentrated focus. 
                                What had happened was not solely <span class="persName-TKH">Hervey</span>ʼs inspiration, however, but a broader trend reflected in a <span class="title-periodical-MONTHLYREVIEW"><i>Monthly Review</i></span> article 
                                published one year earlier, which is clearly the source of <span class="persName-TKH">Hervey</span>ʼs announcement of changes being made in <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span>. The article presents a brief critical history of the British annual, 
                                celebrating the “keen and enterprising spirit of emulation” that has enabled “our countrymen” in a short time to have so improved on the German Taschenbuch that “the least elegant of . . . [the British annuals] is greatly superior to any thing produced on the Continent”. 
                                The key to this progress, according to the article, lay in a marker that carried a rebuke to the proprietor of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Frienshipʼs Offering</i></span>:</div>

                                that formed the “exception” to this brilliant tale of British progress. In <span class="date-1825">1825</span>, probably only one annual represented the pinnacle of achievement—the <span class="title-annual-LITERARYSOUVENIR"><i>Literary Souvenir</i></span>, 
                                edited by <span class="persName-AWEDITOR">Alaric Watts</span>, the sole publication under review in this <span class="title-periodical-MONTHLYREVIEW"><i>Monthly Review</i></span> article.

                                from a nationalistic evolutionary narrative.

                                by discontinuing an existing annual, <span class="title-annual-GRACES"><i>The Graces</i></span>, after publishing only one volume. Although the exchange was friendly, <span class="title-annual-GRACES"><i>The Graces</i></span>, which was born the same year as <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span>, 
                                ironically contributed to the evolutionary narrative by claiming British superiority over Continental models for having disburdened itself of the their “loaded . . . weight” of almanac features, 
                                but then set itself “to embrace . . . every topic of accomplishment, elegance, and polite information, that can interest the general reader”,

                        <div class="p">What signaled the improved “literary character” promised by <span class="persName-TKH">Hervey</span>? 
                                As star material for the <span class="date-1826">1826</span> volume, <span class="persName-ME">Maria Edgeworth</span> (<span class="date-1769-1849">1769–1849</span>) supplied an essay by her father,

                                and juvenilia were recovered by <span class="persName-JTHOMSON">James Thomson</span> (<span class="date-1700-1748">1700–1748</span>). 
                            Otherwise, the roster of contributors for the <span class="date-1826">1826</span> volume proved similar to those for <span class="date-1827">1827</span>.
                                One or both volumes included poet/churchmen such as the <span class="persName-TDREV">Reverend Thomas Dale</span> (<span class="date-1797-1870">1797–1870</span>), <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs future <span class="placeName-CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</span> schoolmaster, and

This class of writers also included the <span class="persName-JMREV">Reverend John Moultrie</span> (<span class="date-1799-1874">1799–1874</span>), the Rugby rector; 
                                and <span class="persName-JMPOET">James Montgomery</span> (<span class="date-1771-1854">1771–1854</span>), the hymn writer. Among “poetesses” appeared L.E.L. (<span class="persName-LEL">Letitia Landon</span>, <span class="date-1802-1838">1802–38</span>) and—a poetess 
                                especially favored in the Ruskin household—<span class="persName-FDH">Felicia Hemans</span> (<span class="date-1793-1835">1793–1835</span>). Among women writers of tales and sketches appeared 
                                <span class="persName-MRM">Mary Russell Mitford</span> (<span class="date-1787-1855">1787–1855</span>) and <span class="persName-ER">Emma Roberts</span> (<span class="date-1791-1840">1791–1840</span>).</div>

                                who supplied mainly verse, but who could also be relied on for a variety of commissions: <span class="persName-BB">Bernard Barton</span> (<span class="date-1784-1849">1784–1849</span>), <span class="persName-JCLARE">John Clare</span> (<span class="date-1793-1864">1793–1864</span>),

                                Relief from the sentiments of such verse came from humorists like <span class="persName-JG">John Galt</span> (<span class="date-1779-1839">1779–1839</span>), <span class="persName-THOOD">Thomas Hood</span> (<span class="date-1799-1845">1799–1845</span>), and <span class="persName-HS">Horace Smith</span> (<span class="date-1779-1849">1779–1849</span>). 
                                The contributors represented cultures of <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>, <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>, <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span>, and <span class="placeName-IRELAND">Ireland</span>, 
                                as well as lived experience from abroad. Some pieces were written in dialect. They represented a variety of religious and ideological stances, 
                                though never so aggressively as to perturb the unifying script of friendship, sentiment, and memory. 
                            Many contributors labored as editors of competing annuals, magazines, and newspapers, including <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs future personal editor, 
                                <a href="/notes/harrison_w_h_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-WHH">W. H.

                        <div class="p">Thus the “improved literary character” of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> succeeded in rendering the volume more predictable. 
                                The <span class="title-periodical-MONTHLYREVIEW"><i>Monthly Review</i></span> commented about the <span class="date-1826">1826</span> volume: “Where the character of this volume so closely corresponds to that of the <span class="title-annual-LITERARYSOUVENIR">‘[Literary] Souvenir’</span>”, reviewed in a previous issue for that year,

                                Regarding the following yearʼs volume, that journal judged the “prose matter . . . [to be] upon the whole, the best that we have seen in any of these annual volumes”, 
                                but “after three or four pieces from the pens of <span class="persName-">Miss Landon</span>, <span class="persName-FDH">Mrs. Hemans</span>, the <span class="persName-TDREV">Rev. Mr. Dale</span>, and <span class="persName-TKH">Mr. Hervey</span>, 
                                we find nothing in the shape of verse, that rises above mediocrity”

                                Fairly or not, reviewers turned to the <span class="title-annual-LITERARYSOUVENIR"><i>Literary Souvenir</i></span> as the standard for taste and execution in illustration, 
                                whereas <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> was at least typical of the period in highlighting the shared “poetry” of the Sister Arts 
                                (see <a href="#POETRYOFSISTERARTS">Illustration: The Poetry of the Sister Arts in the Relfe Annual</a>); 
                                and at least one of Relfeʼs volumes contained a unique venture, a <span class="date-1826">1826</span> sampling of contemporary French art

                                Despite some achievements, however, the future success of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> depended on finding a niche that made the annual distinctive in an increasingly crowded field,

                        In <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, the publication was taken over by the relatively young stationery and bookselling firm of

                        which had recently moved to no. 65 <span class="placeName-building-CORNHILL">Cornhill</span>, near <span class="persName-LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</span>.</div>

                        but with the acquisition of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> the company made a bid for an expanded share of the burgeoning illustrated book market. 
                        Under their custodianship, <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> achieved a steady measure of distinction in the growing field of annuals. 
                            The takeover was made most immediately apparent to the public by an innovative embossed leather binding, which included the publisherʼs name along with the annualʼs title integrated into the cover design and stamped sharply into the material. 
                            (see <a href="#SMITHELDERBINDING">Binding</a>). As part of the deal, Smith, Elder 
                            must have acquired Relfeʼs backstock, since an advertisement offered “sets of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span>,

                            Sales rose, eventually peaking at ten thousand copies per year, helping to assure the fortunes of Smith, Elder as a publisher.

                            At the same time, they enhanced the keepsake element by redesigning the presentation plate to give greater scope to the presenter and presentee:

                            The most immediately striking impression was effected, however, by the annualʼs leather binding with an elaborate Renaissance revival design

                            The volume for <span class="date-1828">1828</span> was edited by <span class="persName-CK">Charles Knight</span> (<span class="date-1791-1873">1791–1873</span>), 
                            the future publisher for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. 
                            In his autobiography, <span class="persName-CK">Knight</span> describes his role in the transition between publishers as hectic: 
                            “It was an enterprise hastily entered upon by Messrs. Smith and Elder, late in the season, 
                            and I had to obtain pictures for engraving, secure contributors, and see the book through the press in two or three months”. 
                            He credits the success of the ordeal to friends who “rallied round” with contributions that he considered 
                            more “original” than the “sentimental stories” and “mawkish” verses “with their bowers and flowers” typical of the annuals 
                            (<a href="/notes/bibliography#KNIGHTPASSAGES" target="_self"><span class="persName-CK">Knight</span>, <span class="title-book-KNIGHTPASSAGES"><i>Passages of a Working Life</i></span></a>, 2:53). While his editorship was only transitory, 
                            and he held the annuals generally in low regard—all too characteristic, he believed, of “a period in which . . . mediocrity was essentially necessary to great literary success” 
                            (<a href="/notes/bibliography#KNIGHTEDITORSROOM1828" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-KNIGHTEDITORSROOM1828">“The Editorʼs Room”</span></a>, 548)—<span class="persName-CK">Knight</span> 
                            characterized the editing of this volume in retrospect as an act of friendship more meaningful than the pretensions suggested by his annualʼs title.</div>

                            The <span class="title-periodical-ETONIAN"><i>Etonian</i></span> was a short‐lived school magazine,

                                highlighting the fellowship of these writers as if they were still precocious Eton youths, and contrasting their “cheerful gaiety” 
                                with the “common‐place, leaden, empty, . . . vapid . . . fashion of these Souvenirs”

                                to <span class="persName-CK">Knight</span>ʼs final volume of the <span class="title-periodical-LONDONMAGAZONE"><i>London Magazine</i></span>: “I wish that I could run away / 
                                From House, and court, and levee / . . . / That I could be a boy again, / A happy boy, at Druryʼs!” 
                                Apart from personal attraction and nostalgia, however, <span class="persName-CK">Knight</span>ʼs part in the publication of the <span class="title-periodical-ETONIAN"><i>Etonian</i></span> may have put him in mind of an alternative to the annuals. 
                                In a review of the annuals for <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, a writer for the <span class="title-periodical-LONDONMAGAZINE"><i>London Magazine</i></span>, who despaired of the annuals ever amassing a pool of genuine talent, 
                                proposed a model based on “the Taschenbuchs of <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span>, which were sometimes got up by a few men of genius, who, 
                                at the end of the year, clubbed their <i>adversaria</i>, and published together a little miscellaneous volume, 
                                which had or might not have some definite object. The hint might, we think, be adopted in this country with advantage”. 
                                Alhough “the time is gone by when men wrote in knots and schools”, the writer considering even the Lake School a thing of the past in <span class="date-1826">1826</span>, 
                                he believed “[t]here are . . . many clubs or schools even at present existing, which might throw together an occasional periodical of this kind with effect, 
                                whether the object be grave or gay—pleasure or improvement”. The echoes of this proposal with <span class="persName-CK">Knight</span>ʼs experience of publishing the <span class="title-periodical-ETONIAN"><i>Etonian</i></span> are striking

                                is not likely to produce any thing beyond a very cold effort; so many of these Annuals, moreover, now appear,

                                which we fear in their rivalry will injure one another like the <span class="placeName-PADDINGTON">Paddington</span> stages, which go from the <span class="placeName-building-BANKOFENGLAND">Bank</span> every quarter of an hour, 
                                and cross and jostle one another on the road”

                                although the <span class="title-periodical-MONTHLYREVIEW"><i>Monthly Review</i></span> did want to know 
                                who <span class="persName-JMREV">Moultrie</span> was, and why the volume contained so many of his poems, “as bad as a dose of opium”

                                    and the <span class="title-annual-ANNIVERSARY"><i>Anniversary</i></span>—that were “edited by Scotchmen” and that showcased Scotch “names . . . shin[ing] most conspicuously in their tables of contents”. 
                                    Of the two, the <span class="title-annual-ANNIVERSARY"><i>Anniversary</i></span> stood out most prominently for making “peculiar claims on the people of <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>”. 
                                    Edited by the poet <span class="persName-ACUNNINGHAM">Allan Cunningham</span>, and making its debut that year, the <span class="title-annual-ANNIVERSARY"><i>Anniversary</i></span> presented what the reviewer admitted may be considered 
                                    “an over degree of nationality” by “[o]ur Southern friends” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#ANNUALS1829EDINBURGLITJNL" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-ANNUALS1829EDINBURGLITJNL">“The Annuals for 1829”</span></a>, 5).</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">Some southern journals did object, as did <span class="title-periodical-BELLEASSEMBLEE"><i>La Belle Assemblée</i></span>, “that too many of the pieces” 
                                    in <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>ʼs <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1829"><span class="date-1829">1829</span> <i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> “derive their origin north of the <span class="placeName-TWEEDRIVER">Tweed</span>”, 
                                    as well as presenting “somewhat too large proportion of what may be termed religious matter”, which “can seldom be amalgamated successfully with the lighter effusions

                                    A connection between those two objections was enforced more straightforwardly and stridently by the <span class="title-periodical-MONTHLYREVIEW"><i>Monthly Review</i></span>, 
                                    which advised the <span class="title-annual-ANNIVERSARY"><i>Anniversary</i></span> to rein in Scotch contributions since “a beautiful work of art” requires that 
                                    “all the parts shall be in unison”;. Although denying that the journal “mean[t] to insinuate any dislike of the true Doric dialect, 
                                    as it has been called, of <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>”, the reviewer urged that “in every instance the current language of <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span> . . . prevail in the literature of the Annuals”

                                    From the first emergence of the annuals, the <span class="title-periodical-MONTHLYREVIEW"><i>Monthly Review</i></span> had treated these publications as “ministers of taste” from the metropolis to the provinces, 
                                    and from <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span> to the empire, and here the presumed Englishness of that unifying standard of taste is made explicit

                        <div class="p">Historically, the <span class="title-periodical-MONTHLYREVIEW"><i>Monthly Review</i></span> set itself up as a gatekeeper not only of taste but also of prescriptive diction and grammar—a

The journal was also known for a longstanding prejudice against religious “enthusiasm”, 
                                    an animus that, in the <span class="date-1700-1799">eighteenth century</span>, was directed against Methodism (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MCINELLYWHENWORLDSCOLLIDE" target="_self"><span class="persName-BCMCINELLY">McInelly</span>, <span class="title-essay-MCINELLYWHENWORLDSCOLLIDE">“When Worlds Collide”</span></a>). 
                                    In <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, the <span class="title-periodical-MONTHLYREVIEW"><i>Monthly Review</i></span> linked what it perceived as linguistic parochialism with religious enthusiasm in the <span class="title-annual-ANNIVERSARY"><i>Anniversary</i></span>, singling out a contribution 
                                    by the Church of Scotland clergyman, <span class="persName-EI">Edward Irving</span> (<span class="date-1792-1834">1792–1834</span>), which the reviewer characterized as given to a 
                                    “‘puritanic . . . phraseology, which literary persons belonging to that sect are too much in the habit of using on all occasions”. 
                                    In contrast, as an example of “neatly written essays on popular subjects”, the reviewer quoted at length from piece in the volume 
                                    “on the Female Beauty of the Three Kingdoms”, which argues that female beauty is independent of nation, being found wherever

                                    that the <span class="title-periodical-MONTHLYREVIEW"><i>Monthly</i></span>ʼs reviewer characterized as a “beautiful . . . unison”. 
                                    While <span class="persName-BONSLOW">Barbara Onslow</span> alerts us that certain classes of illustrated books during this period did pursue distinct audiences and agendas, 
                                    the annuals were directed at “the emotions and associations aroused in the heart and mind of the beholder”

                                    Reviewers might complain about the overall blandness and uniformity of the annuals, especially as the market grew increasingly competitive with new titles added each year, but at the same time the market tended toward uniformity. 
                                    For whatever reason, <span class="persName-ACUNNINGHAM">Cunningham</span>, or his publisher, ceased publication of the <span class="title-annual-ANNIVERSARY"><i>Anniversary</i></span> in the midst of compiling only its second volume. Its demise may not have been connected directly with its Scottish emphasis (<span class="persName-ACUNNINGHAM">Cunningham</span>ʼs

                    For the <span class="title-periodical-MONTHLYREVIEW"><i>Monthly Review</i></span>, critical scrutiny of the annualsʼ literary merit was a sometimes painful duty, 
                    since “fugitive and trifling . . . in some instances” as the pieces were, the poetry and prose were worth “the attention of a journal which professes to watch the intellect of the country”;. 
                    It was the annualsʼ pictorial content, however, that placed the annuals in “a class by themselves, which enables us to judge . . . of the progress made amongst us, not only in literary composition, but in the arts”

                    <span class="title-periodical-LONDONMAGAZINE"><i>The London Magazine</i></span> went further, having been “grievously disappointed” in the annuals considered “as the united labours of the chief persons distinguished in this country for literature and poetry”, 
                    but “looking at the prose and verse merely as the letter‐press of engravings, it assumes a different character”

                  <div class="p">In <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span>, from Relfeʼs volumes to Smith, Elderʼs, the number of “embellishments” per volume remained twelve or thirteen, including the frontispiece and presentation plate, 
                            which form part of the frontmatter. (A <i>presentation plate</i> is an engraved title page with a blank cartouche, in which the giver or owner could 
                    inscribe a name or brief message.) Although some annuals competed by offering more embellishments, a dozen or so was likewise typical of other annuals, 
                    the number perhaps limited by the time and expense required to commission or borrow art, and arrange for the lengthy process of steel reproduction—processes that must have grown more competitive as new titles entered the market each year. 
                    As <span class="persName-AWEDITOR">Alaric Watts</span> pointed out to consumers of the <span class="title-annual-LITERARYSOUVENIR"><i>Literary Souvenir</i></span>, “if, instead of such illustrations as these [ten in number, assembled for the <span class="date-1826">1826</span> volume], from original paintings and drawings, most of which have been procured with very great expense, 
                    I had chosen to introduce inferior plates, perhaps pleasing enough to persons possessing no great refinement of taste, taken from published prints, or obtained from cheap sources, 
                    more than double the number might have been given, at precisely the same cost”. However, in order to keep the price at the competitive twelve shillings per copy, he was obliged to balance the costs of original artwork

                        The speaker declines to engage in rivalry with the painter—that is, the Renaissance <i>paragone</i>, which put the competing descriptive powers of writer and painter at odds, instead of unified in their “poetry”. 
                        Instead, the poem instead proffers a shared poetic language: “I feel / No envy of thy noble art, / . . . which, unto outward sense, / Speaks in a language so refined”.

                        of a modern history painting, which was engraved for volume 26, <span class="title-artwork-"><i>Honors Rendered to Raphael on his Deathbed</i></span> (<span class="date-1806">1806</span>),

                        and “placed at the upper end of the hall wherein he had last worked, with the picture of the Transfiguration, 
                        which he had executed for Cardinal <span class="persName-GDM">Giulio deʼ Medici</span>, at the head of the corpse”

The subject was germane to an ekphrastic miscellany like an annual, 
                        since <span class="persName-RSU">Raphael</span> had come to regarded as embodying the art of painting itself. For the French academic artworld, however, <span class="persName-RSU">Raphael</span> stood for the art of painting as a 
                        “symbolic embodiment of French artistic ideals”. He was a “‘modern <span class="persName-APELLES">Apelles</span>’” answering to “that complete perfection” of art 
                        believed to be “shown in ancient times by the figures of <span class="persName-APELLES">Apelles</span> and <span class="persName-ZEUXIS">Zeuxis</span>”.

                        the Raphaelesque aesthetic ideal also became politicized. <span class="persName-PNB">Bergeret</span>ʼs depiction of <span class="persName-RSU">Raphael</span>ʼs wake, attended by powerful nobles as <span class="persName-GV">Vasari</span> recounted, 
                        was meant to illustrate the premise that great men are glorified by their homage to great artists. If <span class="persName-RSU">Raphael</span> embodied the art of painting,

                        The prone figure of <span class="persName-RSU">Raphael</span> is turned with the “face of death” to the viewer, 
                        a face that is “paler and colder than the marble bust”, but the artistʼs “soul” remains undiminished, not by its fixation in a classical bust, 
                        but by art “leave[ing] its influence on the heart!”, giving “Hope to the trembling—mercy to the weak”

                        <span class="persName-AWEDITOR">Watts</span>ʼs volume presented a steel‐engraved view of the <span class="placeName-THAMES">Thames</span>

                        The two pictures thus put on view the rivalry between the annuals, as well as reflecting the broader aspirations of the young French Romantic artists who, at just this time,

                        subjects that especially attracted <span class="persName-RPB">Bonington</span>—such as the coastal scenery of <span class="placeName-NORMANDY">Normandy</span> 
                        and the Gothic architecture of <span class="placeName-ROUEN">Rouen</span>—seemed random and meaningless, low on the scale of the traditional ordering of the Sister Arts. 
                        Studentsʼ understanding should be elevated by historical and religious subjects rather than by landscape—much less by the localized, provincial scenes 
                        that characterized the British school, as opposed to the timeless classical landscapes of the French tradition. Yet, to the alarm of those who defended

                        British‐influenced picturesque subjects were gaining popularity in <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span>. French critics also rejected the loose style of the British school, 
                        such as the textured brushstrokes of oils by <span class="persName-CONSTABLEARTIST">John Constable</span>, and the tonal rather than linear definition of architectural drawing

                        figure compositions by French artists likewise reflect the tensions between neoclassicism and Romanticism.  
                        In two plates based on paintings by <span class="persName-HV">Horace Vernet</span> (<span class="date-1789-1863">1789–1863</span>),

                        Worse, <span class="persName-HV">Vernet</span> disseminated a taste for such mixed subjects by embracing contemporary forms of art reproduction, such as lithography and aquatint, 
                        which challenged the authority given to line engraving by the French Academy

                     <div class="p">Overall, volume 26 of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> would have been regarded by a traditionalist French critic as representative 
                        of how the invidious commercialization of art through book illustration, and through such popular spectacles as the diorama, threatened a degeneration of the ideology propping up the traditional ordering of the arts. 
                        Even the volumeʼs single example approaching Davidian neoclassicism (softened by color and eroticism), 
                        <span class="title-artwork-GUERINAENEASDIDO"><i>Aeneas Tells Dido the Misfortunes of the City of Troy</i></span>, was based on a work by

                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER" target="_self"><span class="title-book-HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER"><i>House of Smith Elder</i></span></a>, 10). 
                        Presumably, <span class="persName-AE">Elder</span> would have been anxious to showcase the firmʼs expertise in their selection and presentation of the new annualʼs embellishments. 
                        The firm would also have needed to extend their expertise beyond engraving and aquatint to commission steel engraving, which had already been introduced under Relfe (see

                     <div class="p">As at least an appearance of shift in emphasis, Smith, Elder advertised that their debut volume would feature engravings taken from recently exhibited British paintings, 
                        including art “painted expressly for the Work”. The claim was not unprecented: <span class="persName-AWEDITOR">Alaric Watts</span> advertised that two engravings for the <span class="date-1826">1826</span> <span class="title-annual-LITERARYSOUVENIR1826"><i>Literary Souvenir</i></span> were based on originals 
                        “made . . . expressly for this work” by <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> and by <span class="persName-GSN">Gilbert Stuart Newton</span> (<span class="date-1795-1835">1795–1835</span>) (<a href="/notes/bibliography#LITERARYSOUVENIR1826" target="_self">preface to <span class="title-annual-LITERARYSOUVENIR1826"><i>Literary Souvenir</i> [<span class="date-1825">1826</span>]</span></a>, vii). 
                        Albeit an exaggeration, the decision by Smith, Elder to feature pictures from recent <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> exhibitions 
                        spoke to the attention that reviewers gave to annuals as a measure of “the intellect of the country”. The same justification, it seems, lay behind the decision in the list of embellishments for <span class="date-1830">1830</span> volume to give equal weight 
                        to the designation “in the collection of” as to the tags “made expressly for” and “as exhibited at”—the patronage of collectors standing also as a measure of the nationʼs intellect and wealth. 
                        For consumers like the Ruskins, studying the plates with these designations would have raised their awareness of <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> exhibiting institutions and private collections.</div>

                     <div class="p">The success of Smith, Elderʼs takeover of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> 
                                hinged in part on an innovation in binding, which substituted embossed leather for the printed and glazed paper‐covered boards and slipcase that were initially characteristic of both this annual 
                                and <span class="title-annual-FORGETMENOT"><i>Forget Me Not</i></span>. On the evidence, however, of a well‐preserved copy of Relfeʼs second volume, the <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1825"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> for <span class="date-1825">1825</span>, 
                                which was acquired by Princeton University Library Special Collections in <span class="date-2010">2010</span>, one might adjust of narrative of Smith, Elderʼs innovation to take account of 
                                how the new publisher developed the annualʼs existing reputation for splendor rather than supplanting a drab commodity. While it has been known that <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span>, like <span class="title-annual-FORGETMENOT"><i>Forget Me Not</i></span>, was sold pre‐packaged in printed and glazed paper boards and a slipcase, rather than a temporary binding to be replaced by the consumer (see 
                                <a href="/notes/annuals_note#BINDING" target="_self">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books: Bindings</a>), the Princeton copy reveals a slipcase cover 
                                with an elaborate Gothic Revival design in multiple colors, the gothic tracery forming a window or portal enclosing the title, which is lettered in a gothic and scrolled calligraphic style. 
                                The slipcase spine is cleverly printed with a vertical gothic pillar showing statues in niches, and the case retains an attached purple‐silk ribbon‐pull. This design corresponds stylistically to the volumeʼs title page, which is also Gothic Revival but a distinct design, not printed from the same plate used for the slipcase cover. 
                                The title page is likewise printed in multiple colors, and the design is a gothic arch framing the title and publisherʼs imprint lettered in a calligraphic style 
                                (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#PRINCETONLIBRARYSPECIALCOLLECTIONSBLOG-2010-04-10" target="_self">“‘<span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> wears a most captivating appearance’: <span class="date-1825">1825</span>”</a>). 
                                As a visual artifact, Relfeʼs annual presented a striking and luxurious appearance; and its brightly colored design, 
                                like the mechanized leather embossing that replaced it, originated in the tastes instilled by the Gothic Revival combined with innovative and cheapening industrial‐age printing and binding technologies 
                                (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#JAMIESONENGLISHEMBOSSEDBINDINGS" target="_self"><span class="persName-EJ">Jamieson</span>, <span class="title-book-"><i>English Embossed Bindings</i></span></a>, 1, 7–31).</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">The boards of the Princeton copy likewise suggest that Smith, Elder was elaborating on, rather than eclipsing, the impression made by Relfeʼs earlier binding. 
                                This example has a front board covered with a pale embossed paper, which is probably related to a lilac‐colored case made from embossed card that <span class="persName-EJ">Eleanore Jamieson</span> observed on an <span class="date-1827">1827</span> copy of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span>, Relfeʼs final volume. 
                                These embossed papers were produced in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> using a “fly‐embossing‐press”, a machine that exerted high pressure to stamp “so sharp and detailed an impression over the whole cover” 
                                that the covers had to be embossed separately from the book as case bindings, as opposed to “blocked bindings” that applied embossed patterns to the cover after the book was already bound 
                                (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JAMIESONENGLISHEMBOSSEDBINDINGS" target="_self"><span class="persName-EJ">Jamieson</span>, <span class="title-book-"><i>English Embossed Bindings</i></span></a>, 8–10; and see 
                                The embossed design is an arabesque surrounding the borders 
                                <a href="/notes/bibliography#PRINCETONLIBRARYSPECIALCOLLECTIONSBLOG-2010-04-10" target="_self">“‘<span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> wears a most captivating appearance’: <span class="date-1825">1825”</span></a>). 
                                Embossed covers in leather, produced by this powerful machine to stamp arabesque designs over the entire surface of the boards, were first produced around <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, simultaneously with its use for Smith, Elderʼs debut volume of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span>. 
                                The bindings for Smith, Elder were produced by <span class="persName-ABAIN">Alexander Bain</span>, whose name is stamped in tiny but precise lettering at the bottom‐center of the boards, beneath the more prominently lettered publisherʼs name 
                                (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JAMIESONENGLISHEMBOSSEDBINDINGS" target="_self"><span class="persName-EJ">Jamieson</span>, <span class="title-book-"><i>English Embossed Bindings</i></span></a>, 10–12, 17). 
                                There are correspondences between the Relfe arabesque design, which includes a lyre in the center‐top and center‐bottom borders, and the Smith, Elder cover, which also employs the lyre device, but causes it to stand out, 
                                blocked in gilt in the center of the full front cover. Thus, again, a comparison of the Relfe and the Smith, Elder embossed bindings can be viewed in terms of continuity as well as of change in kind—retaining and developing some design elements, 
                                as the new machine‐embossing technology was applied first to paper and then to leather.</div>

                                a welcome improvement in practical use, “unit[ing] the <i>utile cum dulci</i>”, and glanced at the implications of a sturdier binding that could withstand more strenuous handling. 
                                The reviewer regarded the “substituting for the usual paper covering [i.e., the former printed and glazed paper boards], an elegantly embossed leather binding” to be “altogether an improvement on the original plan, 
                                since the slight coverings of silk or paper is [<i>sic</i>] scarcely safe out of the drawing‐room or boudoir, and some of the contributions to the ‘annuals’ entitle them to a higher stand”

                                A perceived advantage of embossed leather appears to have been to combine luxury with durability, overcoming the need for a slipcase; however, <span class="persName-EJ">Eleanore Jamieson</span> comments that the leather bindings were not as practical as they appeared. 
                                The embossing could not withstand shelfwear, and the books remained on the drawing‐room table (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JAMIESONENGLISHEMBOSSEDBINDINGS" target="_self"><span class="title-book-"><i>English Embossed Bindings</i></span></a>, 3).</div>

                                “light” and “popular” literature should strive beyond the “idealess”. Even if “these little books go into the hands of young ladies chiefly, 
                                and they lie about drawing‐rooms for several months”, they presented a “fine opportunity to make some deep and lasting impressions upon the sensible and amiable hearts, as well as upon the fine deep eyes, blue and black, of the <span class="title-annual-LITERARYSOUVENIR"><i>Souvenir</i></span> readers”

                                “the colour . . . [was] varied” in the leather binding “for the gratification of different tastes”

                                a formal floral and leaf pattern, suggestive of Renaissance or Rococo ornament, as distinct from <i>cathedral</i> patterns, in the style of Gothic architectural ornament

                                The cathedral style was associated with devotional publications, although, as we have seen, the printed boards and slipcase of the Relfe annual might be called <i>cathedral</i>.

                                would have suggested the bindings of prayer books and bibles—the only bound stock, besides gift books, that retailers typically offered over the counter 
                                (as opposed to temporary paper‐covered boards, meant to be replaced by the consumer). These “gospel‐like bindings” may have been meant 
                                “to convince the reading public of the wholesome value of the literature and engravings within”

                                If these associations are valid, then Smith, Elder might be viewed as maintaining the sacred connotation of Relfeʼs binding; however, by replacing a cathedral design with an arabesque,
                                the later publisher may have disassociated their new look from a more specifically ecclesiastical appearance—a possible source of anxiety, as the rise in popularity of the annuals in the later <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> coincided with the growing religious controversy surrounding the <span class="title-law-CATHOLICEMANCIPATION">Catholic Emancipation Act</span> of <span class="date-1829">1829</span>.</div>

                                Tables were set out, and we sealed up each copy in a wrapper. When the work was all over we were regaled with wine and cake and sang songs’”
                                (quoted in <a href="/notes/bibliography#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER" target="_self"><span class="persName-LHUXLEY">Huxley</span>, <span class="title-book-HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER"><i>House of Smith, Elder</i></span></a>, 14). 
                                The wrapper was a distinct style of <span class="date-1800-1899">nineteenth‐century</span> dust‐jacket that completely enclosed the book like gift‐wrapping, 
                                the point being both to protect the fancy binding and to market the annual as a seasonal gift. 
                                A surviving wrapper for the <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1830"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> for <span class="date-1830">1830</span>, discovered in <span class="date-2009">2009</span>, so far holds the record as the earliest known example (ca. <span class="date-1829">1829</span>) 
                                of a publisherʼs dust‐jacket or wrapper (i.e., a paper envelope manufactured and applied by the publisher, as opposed to handmade or bespoke dust‐jackets contrived for private or institutional use, which are known to have existed much earlier;

                                It is not known whether <span class="persName-LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</span> used a wrapper to provide additional protection for copies of his <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> in their printed slipcases.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">As <span class="persName-MRG">Mark Godburn</span> explains, the history of <span class="date-1800-1899">nineteenth‐century</span> publishersʼ dust‐jackets, as told by <span class="date-1900-1999">twentieth‐century</span> bibliographers, 
                                    attributed their emergence to publishersʼ adoption of ready‐made bindings, which resulted from the innovation and mechanization of binding processes in the <span class="date-1800-1829">first two decades of the century</span>. 
                                    While the earlier bibliographic account fixated on the invention of cloth covers, which was developed in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> at about the same time as case bindings 
                                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MCKITTERICKCHANGES" target="_self"><span class="persName-DMCK">McKitterick</span>, <span class="title-essay-MCKITTERICKCHANGES">“Changes in the Look of the Book”</span></a>, 97–98), 
                                    <span class="persName-MRG">Godburn</span> points out that dust‐jackets and wrappers were made a necessity by the broader variety of fancy bindings early in the century, not just the more decorated examples of cloth bindings; 
                                    and he suggests that wrappers were especially associated with marketing the annuals and their predecessors, the pocket books. 
                                    The surviving wrapper for the <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1830"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering . . . for <span class="date-1830">MDCCCXXX</span></i></span> reveals that even this ephemeral paper covering was designed to flatter buyers with a luxury commodity. 
                                    Smith, Elder had it made from quality paper, and fastened its folds around the book with red sealing wax. The paper was printed so that, when folded properly, 
                                    the front, back, and spine of the package would show a decorated title, advertisements for additional collectorʼs items 
                                    (e.g., separate portfolios of the volumeʼs engravings), and the annualʼs signature verse epigraph, which the buyer would find also inside, printed on the title page
