                        new docks had been recently completed or were under construction to service the enormous increase in trade. 
                        Over the course of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, rapidly growing congestion at the quays had become untenable, 
                        causing damage to ships, and creating conditions of lax control that resulted in huge losses due to thievery and smuggling. 
                        Consequently, within the first decade of the nineteenth century, a legislative and engineering feat was undertaken to construct extensive new wetdocks, 
                        an accomplishment was celebrated as a testimonial to <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>ʼs commercial might 
                        (though the new docks would soon be made obsolete by growing size of ships powered by steam). 
                        To manage trade with <span class="placeName-INDIA">India</span>, the new <span class="placeName-building-WESTINDIADOCKS">West India Docks</span> were built in the <span class="placeName-ISLEOFDOGS">Isle of Dogs</span>, 
                        and the new <span class="placeName-building-EASTINDIADOCKS">East India docks</span> arose at <span class="placeName-BLACKWALL">Blackwall</span>. Closer to the City, 
                        the new <span class="placeName-LONDONDKS">London Docks</span> were built at <span class="placeName-WAPPING">Wapping</span>. As <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was writing his first 
                        <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">“Harry and Lucy”</span> volume, the <span class="placeName-building-STKATHERINEDOCK">St. Katherine Dock</span> was under construction near the

                        other than the Indies trade (a monopoly that backfired during the <span class="date-1799-11-09-1815-06-18">Napoleonic Wars</span>, when imports of wine were disturbed). 
                        When the monopoly expired, and a free‐trade legislature was disinclined to renew it, 
                        the case made for the openly competitive <span class="placeName-building-STKATHERINEDOCK">St. Katherine Dock</span> was led, among others, by wine merchants 
                        who complained that the <span class="placeName-LONDONDKS">London Docks</span> lacked adequate warehousing for the barrels that now crowded in shipments

                        yet “the vast body of casual labourers” unsteadily employed there “struck at the very heart of the social, moral and political 
                        concern exercising the minds of nineteenth‐century middle‐class observers in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, who . . . singled out the figure

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> perhaps meant to invoke such an impression when referring to “the men at <span class="placeName-building-STKATHERINEDOCK">St. Catherineʼs Docks</span> . . . under Tower Hill”, 
                        who by implication rank among the lowest and most neglected of the “host of earth”. Perhaps this reference was also personal, 
                        meant to include his own family among the “religious friends” he mocks in the letter as claiming to “ʼhave nothing to do with it—you
