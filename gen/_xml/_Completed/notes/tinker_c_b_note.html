               <div class="p"><span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span> was an influential teacher of eighteenth‐ and nineteenth‐century English literature at Yale University from <span class="date-1903-1945">1903 to 1945</span>; 
                    he was also keeper of rare books for Yale University Library starting in <span class="date-1930">1930</span> or <span class="date-1931">1931</span>, remaining in that post 
                    for a number of years beyond his retirement from teaching. A collector himself, <span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span> was known for his generosity 
                    in opening his personal library of manuscripts and rare books for studentsʼ use—a generous trait he held in common 
                    with his friend and fellow collector, <a href="/notes/adam_r_b_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-RBA">R. B. Adam II</span> (<span class="date-1863-1940">1863–1940</span>)</a>

               <div class="p"><span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span>, who had always been a zealous advocate for building the Yale libraryʼs collections, was just beginning his formal duties 
                    as keeper of rare books, when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collectors and scholars on both sides of the <span class="geogName-ATLANTIC">Atlantic</span> were surprised by the announcement of the 
                    <a href="/notes/provenance_sothebys_1930_note" target="_self">Sothebyʼs Sale of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> Manuscripts and Library, <span class="date-1930">1930</span></a> and, a year later, the 
                    <a href="/notes/provenance_sothebys_1931_note" target="_self">Sothebyʼs Sale of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> Manuscripts and Library, <span class="date-1931">1931</span></a>. 
                    At Yale, since the two Sothebyʼs <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> sales coincided exactly with the completion the new <span class="placeName-building-STERLINGMEM">Sterling Memorial Library building</span> (<span class="date-1927-1931">1927–31</span>), 
                    proposals for new rare book and manuscript acquisitions must have encountered stiff competition merely for the attention of library administrators, 
                    much less for available funding. The first Sothebyʼs <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> auction was held on <span class="date-1930-07-24">24 July 1930</span>, when the Yale staff had begun 
                    moving books to the <span class="placeName-building-STERLINGMEM">Sterling</span> stacks, a process initiated on <span class="date-1930-07-07">7 July 1930</span>. 
                    <span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span> later wrote that he took up his post as keeper “some four or five months before the opening of the new <span class="placeName-building-STERLINGMEM">Sterling library</span>”, 
                    but left unclear whether he referred to the months prior to the transfer of operations in the summer of <span class="date-1930">1930</span> 
                    or to the formal dedication of the building, which was held on <span class="date-1931-04-11">11 April 1931</span>—or perhaps he meant the opening of the Rare Books Room, 
                    which was ready on <span class="date-1931-02-22">22 February 1931</span> 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#KEOGHREPORT_1930-31" target="_self">“Report of the Librarian, July 1, 1930–June 30, 1931”</a>, 3;

                    Whenever he assumed duties, the transition in responsibility may explain some of the obscurity surrounding how Yale 
                    acquired certain items in the sale (see 
                    <a href="/notes/provenance_sothebys_1930_note#BUYERS" target="_self">Sothebyʼs Sale of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> Manuscripts and Library, <span class="date-1930">1930</span>: The Buyers</a>).</div>
               
               <div class="p">Documentation remains to be uncovered to reconstruct fully by what agency Yaleʼs acquisitions from the Sothebyʼs sales 
                    made their way to the library. Two important lots from the <span class="date-1930">1930 sale</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs juvenilia and his letters to his father, were bought 
                    probably by <span class="persName-ALLENH">Hugh Allen</span>, who was a son of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs publisher, <span class="persName-GA">George Allen</span>, and who may have acted as an agent directly for Yale. 
                    Other lots from the <span class="date-1930">1930 sale</span> were bought by an agent on the behalf of the <span class="placeName-BOSTON">Boston</span> rare book dealer and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collector, 
                    <a href="/notes/goodspeed_charles_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-CG">Charles E. Goodspeed</span> (<span class="date-1867-1950">1867–1950</span>)</a>, 
                    who sold the lots to Yale in <span class="date-1930-11">November 1930</span> 
                    (see <a href="/notes/provenance_sothebys_1930_note#BUYERS" target="_self">Sothebyʼs Sale of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> Manuscripts and Library, <span class="date-1930">1930</span>: The Buyers</a>). 
                    Whatever the exact arrangements were, it seems unlikely that these important <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> investments would have been undertaken 
                    without his urging and involvement of <span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span>.</div>

                  <div class="p">While <span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span>ʼs scholarship was centered in <span class="persName-JBOSWELL">Boswell</span> and <span class="persName-SJ">Johnson</span> studies—at least initially, until difficulties with access to manuscripts 
                    derailed his aspirations to continue editing <span class="persName-JBOSWELL">Boswell</span>ʼs papers—<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and the Pre‐Raphaelites held an important place 
                    in his teaching, collecting, and writing. In <span class="date-1908">1908</span>, <span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span> published 
                    <a href="/notes/bibliography#JRSELECTIONSTINKER" target="_self"><span class="title-anthology-JRSELECTIONSTINKER"><i>Selections from the Works of John Ruskin</i></span></a>, 
                    an anthology that he distanced from “such a volume as used to be entitled Elegant Extracts”, instead reprinting chapters and lectures 
                    from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs works in as complete a form as practicable in order “to insure a correct notion of the general complexion” of the criticʼs ideas. 
                    For <span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs thought and literary style constituted a unity, which must be studied as “one continuous development” (pp. iii, xii, xix). 
                    Such a position would have favored the acquisition of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs juvenilia and letters to his father, along with later manuscripts sampling the wide range 
                    of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs interests, that Yale gained from the 
                    <a href="/notes/provenance_sothebys_1930_note" target="_self">Sothebyʼs Sale of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> Manuscripts and Library, <span class="date-1930">1930</span></a>.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span>ʼs personal collection of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> included five autograph letters; and his rare and first‐edition printed <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, 
                    while not aspiring to comprehensiveness, ranged widely across <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs interests and rhetorical styles 
                    (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#METZDORFTINKERLIBRARY" target="_self"><span class="persName-">Metzdorf</span>, <span class="title-book-"><i>The Tinker Library</i></span></a>, 371–74). 
                    He and his students had access, moreover, to a comprehensive <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collection belonging to <a href="/notes/adam_r_b_note" target="_self">R. B. Adam</a>, 
                    which <span class="persName-RBA">Adam</span> donated to Yale University Library in <span class="date-1929">1929</span>, in friendship and in support of <span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span>ʼs tireless advocacy 
                    on behalf of the libraryʼs collections 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#HYDEADAMTINKERNEWTON1" target="_self"><span class="persName-MHYDE">Hyde</span>, <span class="title-essay-HYDEADAMTINKERNEWTON1">“Adam, Tinker, and Newton”</span></a>, 304). 
                    Equally beneficial to the libraryʼs <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> holdings, if less happily in circumstances, the <span class="placeName-BOSTON">Boston</span> book dealer 
                    <a href="/notes/goodspeed_charles_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-CG">Charles E. Goodspeed</span> (<span class="date-1867-1950">1867–1950</span>)</a> 
                    donated the manuscripts in his keeping, which had been damaged by his house fire in <span class="date-1941">1941</span>. 
                    <span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span>, at that time still keeper of rare books and manuscripts, was <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>ʼs correspondent during the salvage, 
                    and presumably <span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span> helped oversee the care of the scorched items. A decade earlier, <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> had served as the primary, 
                    if not perhaps the exclusive mediator for Yaleʼs acquisitions from the Sothebyʼs <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> sales. 
                    <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> entrusted Yale University Library with the remains of his 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collection because, it was said, he wished “to complete Yaleʼs holdings of the available major <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscripts, 
                    so many of which had passed through his hands on their way to <span class="placeName-NEWHAVEN">New Haven</span>”
