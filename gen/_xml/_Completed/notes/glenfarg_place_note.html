                    As described in an early twentieth-century guidebook, the glen “commences about one mile [north] from the village”, which was known “in olden times”—the time of Ruskinʼs youth—as <span class="placeName-DAMHEAD">Damhead</span>

                    Through the glen, the river “extends three miles downward till it opens out into <span class="geogName-STRATHEARN">Strathearn</span>” on its north end—that is,

               <div class="p">The growing fame of the picturesque attraction can be traced in successive guidebooks. 
                    In the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>, when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composed his poems, 
                    <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Glenfarg</span> rated a brief mention in one of the “short, portable” guidebooks that <span class="persName-KHGRENIER">Kathleen Grenier</span> says appeared in this decade to lead 
                    “readers on a series of tours” through <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#TOURISMANDIDENTITY" target="_self"><span class="title-book-TOURISMANDIDENTITY"><i>Tourism and Identity in Scotland</i></span></a>, 66). 
                    In <span class="title-book-SCOTTISHTOURIST"><i>The Scottish Tourist</i></span> (<span class="date-1825">1825</span>), the traveler coming south from <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> 
                    is alerted to the glen as “a romantic little valley embosomed by the <span class="geogName-OCHILS">Ochils</span>”. These hills 
                    are characterized as “dwarfish when compared with the lofty <span class="geogName-GRAMPIANS">Grampians</span>” to the north; 
                    yet, because the <span class="placeName-OCHILS">Ochils</span> “present a smooth surface, and are clothed to their summits with the deepest verdure, possessing also a pastoral serenity and softness”, 
                    the scene imparts “a new and pleasurable tone to the mind of the tourist, who returns from contemplating the magnificence of <span class="geogName-SCOTTISHHIGHLANDS">Highland</span> scenery” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#SCOTTISHTOURIST" target="_self"><span class="title-book-SCOTTISHTOURIST"><i>The Scottish Tourist, and Itinerary</i></span> [3d ed., <span class="date-1830">1830</span>]</a>, 125).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">In later accounts, rather than being regarded as easing the spectator down from the grandeur of the <span class="geogName-SCOTTISHHIGHLANDS">Highlands</span>, 
                    the glen takes on its own share of the sublime. When approached from the south, riding north from the <span class="geogName-FIRTHOFFORTH">Firth of Forth</span>—the direction 
                    traveled by the Ruskins when first encountering <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Glenfarg</span> during a tour—the glen presented 
                    “certainly the finest portion of the journey, and perhaps the only bit of grand scenery that is to be met with on the road 
                    between <span class="placeName-QUEENSFERRY">Queensferry</span> and the <span class="placeName-building-EARNBRG">Bridge of Earn</span>”, 
                    according to a travel writer in the <span class="date-1880-1889">1880s</span>. Prior to reaching the glen, in this writerʼs experience, the landscape traversed by the

                    after leaving <span class="placeName-MILNATHORT">Milnathort</span> and losing sight of <span class="geogName-LOCHLEVEN">Loch Leven</span>”, was “of a very dreary character,
                    being bleak and solitary, without any of those grander features which often impart an interest to a wild and unfrequented country”. 
                    Beyond <span class="placeName-DAMHEAD">Damhead</span>, however, “the <span class="placeName-building-GNR">Great North Road</span> skirts the <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Farg</span>”, the road “descend[ing alongside the river] between the wood‐clad sides of the magnificent glen”

               <div class="p">By the early twentieth century, when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poems about <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Glenfarg</span> had become available in print,

                    touted how the route had been highlighted by northbound celebrity travelers, ranging from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                    to <span class="persName-KL1">Prince Leopold of Saxe‐Coburg, the future king of <span class="placeName-BELGIUM">Belgium</span></span> to <span class="persName-QVE">Queen Victoria</span>. 
                    In the <span class="date-1908">1908</span> edition of the guidebook, the glen is credited with having drawn forth the young <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs “descriptive powers” 
                    when he passed through the valley “on a winterʼs day when the rocks were hung with icicles”. This allusion to Ruskinʼs poem, 
                    is expanded in a later edition of the guidebook (ca. <span class="date">1930s</span>), 
                    quoting at length from <a href="/apparatuses/glenfarg_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-GLENFARG">“Glenfarg” <i>and</i> “Glen of Glenfarg” (“Papa how pretty those icicles are”)</span></a>. 
                    For royal testimonials to the beauty of the glen, the guidebook quotes <span class="persName-KL1">Leopold of Saxe‐Coburg</span>, who,

                    declared the beauties of the glen superior even to the romantic vales of <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span>; and <span class="persName-QVE">Queen Victoria</span> is quoted,

                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 19:396–97).
                    In the <span class="date-1840-1849">1840s</span>, the <span class="geogName-FARG">Farg</span> valley was still active with four mills for grinding corn, twenty‐two thrashing mills, and a sawmill; 
                    however, as the century advanced, the local industry declined. According to the <span class="date-1908">1908</span> edition of the <span class="geogName-">Glenfarg</span> guidebook, local mills were undercut by cheap imported flour,  
                    which even “after paying all carriage dues, could be sold at the millerʼs door for less price than he could produce it”. 
                    The meal and flour mills are described as having long been closed, their “decaying walls” along the <span class="geogName-FARG">Farg</span> “now silent as the grave, save when the winds sigh eerily” through them; 
                    and whereas the <span class="date-1908">1908</span> edition of the guidebook could still point to 
                    “old people . . . in our parish” who remembered the mills, the <span class="date-1930">1930s</span> edition concluded that “no one now lives who was familiar with these meal mills in our parish”

               <div class="p">While the perception that local goods were undersold by mass production was partly true, however, the causes of the decline were more complex. 
                    “From the <span class="date-1760-1840">Industrial Revolution</span> through the <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth century</span>, demand increased for a whiter wheaten loaf at the expense of wholemeal wheat, barley, or rye bread”—the 
                    more refined bread believed at the time to be healthier. Simultaneously, changes in technology displaced stone mills with more efficient “roller” mills, 
                    which favored “harder imported wheat” over the “<span class="placeName-BRITAIN">British</span>‐grown softer grains” that ground well by stone. Bakers also preferred imported “strong <span class="geogName-NORTHAMERICA">North American</span>, <span class="placeName-EASTEUROPE">Eastern European</span>, and <span class="placeName-RUSSIA">Russian</span> flours“ 
                    since these “produced a well‐risen loaf with less flour”, increasing bakersʼ profits. Researchers of this history 
                    appreciate the “irony in considering the <span class="date-1875-01-01-1900-12-31">late‐nineteenth‐century</span> revolution in milling with its attendant transformation in consumption patterns 
                    when, a century later, a reversal in consumption is taking with an increasing demand for stone‐ground wholemeal flour, some of it produced in restored country water mills”

Ruskin would likewise have appreciated the irony—and approved the reversal.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would also have regretted the transformation of <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Glenfarg</span> brought about by the rail line laid through the glen.
                    The early twentieth‐century guidebooks to <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Glenfarg</span> were designed to vest the future economy of the region in 
                    “developing into a healthy, attractive summer resort”, supported by rail service and other new amenities 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JACKGLENFARG4ED" target="_self"><span class="persName-JWJ">Jack</span>, <span class="title-book-JACKGLENFARG4ED"><i>Glenfarg and District Past and Present</i></span></a>, 4th ed. [<span class="date-1908">1908</span>], 4). 
                    Dismal as he would have considered that prospect, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs early poems do at least confirm the guidebooksʼ claim that “the air” of <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Glenfarg</span> “is generally clear and dry, 
                    when <span class="geogName-STRATHEARN">Strathearn</span> and <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> are enveloped in mist and dampness”. 
                    In <a href="/apparatuses/on_scotland_apparatus" target="_self">“On Scotland”</a>, he traces the “dreary way” from <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> to <span class="geogName-EARN">River Earn</span>, 
                    whereas in the <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Glenfarg</span> poems he directs the spectator from the “grassy hills” to the clear and “starry” sky 
                    (<a href="/apparatuses/glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-GLENOFGLENFARG">“Glen of Glenfarg” [“Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill”]</span></a>), 
                    and from the “icicles . . . so near” to the “trees . . . waving upon the rocks side” to the “mountains at a distance seen”

                    As the later guidebook boasts, promoting the resort: “Being surrounded by hills”, the village “has thus the double advantage of having a dry, 
                    wholesome, pure air, such as cannnot be found in low‐lying places, and of being well sheltered from violent winds, 
                    or cold inclement blasts” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JACKGLENFARG7ED" target="_self"><span class="persName-JWJ">Jack</span>, <span class="title-book-JACKGLENFARG7ED"><i>Glenfarg and District Past and Present</i></span></a>, 7th ed.
