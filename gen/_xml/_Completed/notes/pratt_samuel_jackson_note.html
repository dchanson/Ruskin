               <div class="p"> <span class="persName-SJP">Pratt</span> was a minor British writer characteristic of the “age of sentiment.” 
                    At the end of his life, <span class="persName-SJP">Pratt</span> was eulogized in <span class="date-1801-1834">early nineteenth‐century</span> periodicals, according to <span class="persName-JGA">Josephine Grieder,</span>

                    “style of singularly mawkish sentimentality and empty affectation” during a time already marked by an unprecedented 
                    “ascendency” of a “labored, tortuous, and essentially unnatural and untrue style” that
