                        running ninety journeys between them. Omnibuses were introduced in <span class="date-1835">1835</span>, at first used mainly by casual travelers into the city, 
                        not businessmen who departed earlier than these conveyances started. The frequency of omnibus schedules 
                        accommodating all commuter travel increased at mid‐century. Then in the <span class="date-1860-1869">1860s</span>, 
                        railways became a practical means of suburban commuting to and from work in the city. 
                        The preceding decades of rail development was associated with distance travel, not suburban commuting
