               <div class="p"><span class="persName-RG">Richard Gray</span> was a Scotsman who pursued a career much like that of <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>. 
                    In <span class="date-1812">1812</span>, when <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> was growing frustrated with his position in the wine firm, 
                    Gordon, Murphy & Company, he remarked to his mother that “<span class="persName-RG">Gray</span> is doing a great deal at <span class="placeName-LISBON">Lisbon</span> & is a Merchant of consequence 
                    now . . . I look upon his fortune as made” (<span class="title-letter-jjr_to_cr_1812-10-05">John James to Catherine Ruskin, 5 October 1812</span>, in

                    In <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> also characterizes <span class="persName-RG">Richard</span> as resembling his father 
                    in the “scholarly love of good literature”, and even exceeding him in “romantic sentiment”. 
                    <span class="persName-RG">Gray</span> probably helped <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> navigate foreign life in <span class="placeName-SPAIN">Spain</span> and <span class="placeName-PORTUGAL">Portugal</span>, 
                    when <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> traveled there sometime between <span class="date-1815-1817">1815 and 1817</span> 
                    to learn about sherry production (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 35:100;

               <div class="p">It was during <span class="persName-RG">Gray</span>ʼs time in <span class="placeName-LISBON">Lisbon</span>, according to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, 
                    that he met and married <span class="persName-MMONRO">Mary Monro</span>, an “extremely good and beautiful Scotch girl”  
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 35:100). 
                    Later, the Grays and the Ruskins became neighbors when, in <span class="date-1823">1823</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> had become securely positioned with his own firm, Ruskin, Telford, & Domecq, 
                    and he moved his family to the house atop <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> in the <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> suburb of <span class="placeName-CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</span>. 
                    <span class="persName-MMONRO">Mary</span> and <span class="persName-RG">Richard Gray</span> were either then already established in <span class="placeName-CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</span> or would soon purchase their property, 2 Grove Hill Terrace. 
                    (<span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span> suggests that the Grays arrived in <span class="placeName-CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</span> after the Ruskins had settled in <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span>; 
                    however, a <span class="title-letter-mr_to_jjr_1822-01-30">letter by <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, <span class="date-1822-01-30">30 January 1822</span></span>, indicates that the Grays were then already living in <span class="placeName-CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> taking <span class="persName-JR">John</span> there for an extended stay, away from the Ruskinsʼ <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> house in <span class="placeName-HUNTERST">Hunter Street</span>

                    <span class="persName-MMONRO">Mary</span>ʼs mother, “old Mrs. Monro” and her “white French poodle, Petite”

                    <span class="persName-MONROMRS">Mrs. Monro</span>, too, was a prior acquaintance. In <span class="date-1821">1821</span>, for example, 
                    <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> wrote to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> describing a visit by “Mrs. Gray & Mrs. Monro” 
                    to the Ruskinsʼ <span class="placeName-building-HUNTERST">Hunter Street</span> house, during which <span class="persName-MMONRO">Mary</span> sat with <span class="persName-JR">John</span> 
                    “on the drawing room floor very deeply engrossed” in teaching <span class="persName-JR">John</span> to play the flute

               <div class="p">Since the Gray household proved childless, the Grays and <span class="persName-MONROMRS">Mrs. Monro</span> continued to take great interest in <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs development,

                    <span class="persName-MONROMRS">Mrs. Monro</span> is presumably the addressee of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs ca. <span class="date-1829">1829</span> <a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_monromrs_1829_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-jr_to_monromrs_1829">Letter to Mrs. Monro</span></a>, 
                    copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span>. However, while <span class="persName-MMONRO">Mary Gray</span>ʼs mother seems the likeliest addressee of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs letter, 
                    it is possible that another <span class="persName-MONROROBERTMRS">Mrs. Monro</span> was intended—namely, the wife of <span class="persName-RMONRO">Robert Monro</span>, who was a brother of <span class="persName-MMONRO">Mary</span>ʼs. 
                    The maiden name of this <span class="persName-MONROROBERTMRS">Mrs. Monro</span> was Dowie. All three families—the Grays, the Monros, and the Dowies—were 
                    lifelong friends of the Ruskins
