               <div class="p">Travel writer and editor. Born in <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span>, <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> formed part of the Scottish literary circle in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, 
                    a circle with which the Ruskin family enjoyed contact in the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>, when <span class="persName-JJR">John</span> was first entering the publishing scene. 
                    <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> was related on both his fatherʼs and motherʼs sides to writers and artists, including a connection by marriage to the important

                    for publication in the annual. This volume of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> 
                    also contains an ekphrastic poem that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composed originally for the annual to accompany an engraved plate,

               <div class="p">It is unlikely that <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> had much to do with the commissioning and revision of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poems. 
                    For much of <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, when this volume of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> was in preparation, 
                    <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> was abroad, preparing a travel book, 
                    <a href="/notes/bibliography#INGLISIRELAND" target="_self"><span class="title-manual_guide-"><i>Ireland in 1834</i></span></a>—a tour, 
                    according to the bookʼs subtitle, that occupied the author during the “spring, summer, and autumn” of that year. 
                    <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> dated the bookʼs dedication from <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, <span class="date-1834-11">November 1834</span> (p. vi), which would have been about the time that 
                    <a href="/notes/bibliography#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835" target="_self"><span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering; and Winterʼs Wreath . . . for MDCCCXXXV</i></span></a> 
                    was released for public sale. It is more likely that the editing of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poems remained in the hands of 
                    <a href="/notes/pringle_thomas_note" target="_self">Thomas Pringle (<span class="date-1789-1834">1789–1834</span>)</a>, 
                    who was editor of the annual <span class="date-1828-1834-12">from 1828 until his death in December 1834</span>.</div>
               
               <div class="p">With the onset of <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>ʼs tuberculosis in late <span class="date-1834-06">June 1834</span>, <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> 
                    did step into the breach at some point in the <span class="date-1834-07-1834-12">second half of the year</span> in order to help oversee the annual. 
                    As <a href="/notes/harrison_w_h_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-WHH">W. H. Harrison</span> (ca. <span class="date-1792-1878">1792–1878</span>)</a> explains in the preface to 
                    <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> for <span class="date-1836">1836</span>, 
                    which he took over following <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span>ʼs own death in <span class="date-1835-03">March 1835</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> “assisted” <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> “in the last year” of <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>ʼs editorship

                    It was apparently a longstanding friendship that enabled <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> in his last days to rely on <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span>, who, according to <span class="persName-RV">Randolph Vigne</span>, 
                    had formerly benefited from <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>ʼs support when making his way in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> literary life. 
                    Their acquaintance extended back to university days in <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span>, <span class="persName-RV">Vigne</span> reports—though, 
                    if so, <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> would have been a youth who was <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>ʼs junior by six years 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#VIGNEPRINGLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-RV">Vigne</span>, <span class="title-book-VIGNEPRINGLE"><i>Thomas Pringle</i></span></a>, 16).</div>
               
               <div class="p">Much of <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span>ʼs assistance must have been directed at the volume for <span class="date-1836">1836</span>, 
                    since <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> sent the volume for <span class="date-1835">1835</span> to press in <span class="date-1834-08">August 1834</span>

                    Before being absolutely forced by declining health to give up work, <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> could not have afforded to resign his editorial post. 
                    As he commented in a letter of <span class="date-1834-10">October 1834</span>, in which he pleaded for financial help in order to move to a warmer climate, 
                    he “was utterly . . . without income, except what depended on [his] pen”

               <div class="p">There is one possible connection between <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs composition of the poem, 
                    <a href="/apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">“Saltzburg”</span></a>. Whereas the Ruskin family first visited the Austrian city 
                    during the <a href="/notes/tour_of_1835" target="_self">Tour of 1835</a>, too late to have served as the occasion for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem of <span class="date-1834">1834</span>,
                    <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> had traveled to <span class="placeName-JRSALZBURG">Salzburg</span> and written about his experiences in <span class="title-book-"><i>The Tyrol; with a Glance at Bavaria</i></span> (<span class="date-1833">1833</span>). 
                    <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span>, however, did not consider there to be “much in <span class="placeName-SALZBURG">Salzburg</span> to detain the traveller long”; 
                    and nothing in his published account suggests a possible source for details in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#INGLISTYROL" target="_self"><span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span>, <span class="title-book-INGLISTYROL"><i>The Tyrol</i></span></a>, 270, and see 269–71). 
                    If there was a contact between <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> and the Ruskins—or contact via <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>—he 
                    might have communicated some ideas about <span class="placeName-SALZBURG">Salzburg</span> personally, 
                    including the dubious information that the patron saint of <span class="placeName-SALZBURG">Salzburg</span>, <span class="persName-STRUPERT">St. Rupert</span>, 
                    “was by birth a Scotchman”, as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> asserted in a note to his poem. 
                    This notion was available in the <span class="title-book-DEMPSTERHISTORIA"><i>Historia ecclesiastica gentis Scotorum</i></span> 
                    by <span class="persName-TDSCHOLAR">Thomas Dempster</span> (<span class="date-1579-1625">1579–1625</span>),
