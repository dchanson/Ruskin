His writing about the mountains is often generalized and literary in origin. The trope of first sighting frames the sublime spectacle of the distant <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>, 
                    which are understood as a “barrier” both between nations on earth and between planes of earthly and spiritual existence. One influential source of these tropes for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>
                    was the poem <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEALPS">“<span class="geogName-ALPS">The Alps</span>”</span> in <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i><span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span></i></span> by

                    As explained in connection with another important first‐sighting poem for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>,

                    <span class="placeName-JR">Ruskin</span> fails to specify which range of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> he first saw illuminated by the setting sun, leading to speculation later by both himself and critics about what would in fact have been visible

               <div class="p">Respecting certain kinds of sublime experience, the specific chain of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> that travelers first sighted would not have mattered. The Nonconformist clergyman,

                    a chain that would have been invisible to the Ruskins approaching the mountains from the north in <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span>. Nonetheless, <span class="persName-TRAFFLES">Raffles</span> was moved to pious reflections, 
                    which he expressed using tropes similar to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs:</div>

                     <div class="p">[T]he carriage suddenly stopped, and the postilion cried out, <i>Thereʼs <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span>! 
                                There are the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>!</i> I started from a deep reverie into which I had fallen, and lifting up my eyes, beheld the whole chain of 
                                <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>, forming the line of the horizon, at the immense distance of one hundred and thirty miles, and yet distinctly seen 
                                with the naked eye. <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span> appeared towering above them all, and glittering in the sunbeams like a crystal lake. 
                                The emotions of my mind at that moment were unutterable. I had not power to speak—my heart beat with increased rapidity within my bosom—and 
                                now that the sublime and stupendous objects, upon which my imagination had dwelt so long and with so much ardour,were actually before me, I could scarcely realize the scene, 
                                or believe the vision true. And, indeed, there was something so unearthly in their appearance—distance, and the splendours of a summer noon had so melted and 
                                softened them down—that they looked like a singular combination of dark and brilliant clouds resting on the earth; while the suddenness and unexpectedness of their appearance, 
                                all contributed to heighten the effect, and give it more the air of enchantment than reality. You may smile, perhaps, that I should make so much of what 
                                some would deem a very little thing, and occupy so many lines in telling you where and when I first saw the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>. But if there are any scenes 
                                that interest me, next to the important discoveries of the sacred volume, they are the sublime and beautiful in nature—such objects as surround me now, 
                                and such as are to feast my eyes and fill my heart, if life and health are spared, through the ensuing week. The man who does not kindle at these displays of the 
                                <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">Creator</span>ʼs power—that has no spirit stirring in his breast to harmonize and mingle with them, 
                                had better stay in cities, and study man! But I am happy sometimes to escape from <i>man</i>, to study <i>nature</i>—and amidst her awful 
                                or her lovely scenes, to converse with <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">God</span>. I send you a sketch of the scenery to which I have now alluded. It was committed immediately to paper, while the outline was before me. 
                                It has the merit of correctness, therefore, though I am well aware it is destitute of every other.</div>
