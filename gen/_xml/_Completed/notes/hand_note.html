                                    at the very start. But after <span class="date-1830">1830</span> he exchanged, perhaps at the instance of superior orders, his &#x201C;print&#x201D;

                                    coming in, and all his letters to the old&#x2010;fashioned business man show the obvious desire to please.

                                    at the end is in black letter, finishing a sheet of impeccable commercial&#x2010;hand, in which the 
                                    free&#x2010;and&#x2010;easy wording contrasts quite ludicrously with the formal writing.</div>

                    that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> was describing, see the

                    As this and many other documents show, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did employ a &#x201C;copperplate&#x201D; cursive hand in the <span class="date-1830-01-01-1839-12-31">1830s</span>, 
                    especially for his fair&#x2010;copy poems and for some letters addressed to his father. <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s narrative is deficient, however, in supposing that 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was entirely and precociously self&#x2010;taught in his handwriting until required to imitate a copybook round hand, 
                    modeling the personality of his hand on his <span class="persName-JJR">father</span>&#x02BC;s mercantile writing. The narrative 
                    not only neglects to identify what precisely was precocious and self&#x2010;fashioning about his earliest hand as compared with male discipline &#x201C;under orders&#x201D; of copybook instruction; 
                    the story also fails even to pose questions about his mother&#x02BC;s teaching. <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> frames <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s education in writing 
                    as a Rousseauist and Wordsworthian binary of nature and culture that refuses even to take account of mothers as the primary mediators of the written word 
                    (&#x201C;there is some trace of teaching at the very start&#x201D;)&#x2014;a role that <span class="persName-MMYERS">Mitzi Myers</span> 
                    and others have worked to reinstate in histories of education and children&#x02BC;s literature.</div>
         
         
         <div class="p">Even apart from its underlying ideological framework, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s argument appears skewed by the context of its publication. 
                    Remarking on variations in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s handwriting, 
                    <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> explains these using a sweeping claim about the &#x201C;chameleon&#x201D; quality of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s personality: 
                    &#x201C;For his mother he had another hand; for his friends and for himself an assortment of varying scribbles. 
                    But there, I think, comes out one of the leading points in his character. To be a man of strong thought and will, 
                    innovator in art, science, politics, morality, and religion, there never was such a chameleon, always ready to colour his mind 
                    after his surroundings; all things to all men&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#WGCRUSKINSHAND");?>" target="_self">Collingwood, <span class="title-essay-">&#x201C;Ruskin&#x02BC;s Hand&#x201D;</span>, <span class="title-periodical-GOODWORDS"><i>Good Words</i></span></a>, 652; 
                    reprinted in <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#WGCRUSKINRELICS");?>" target="_self">Collingwood, <span class="title-book-WGCRUSKINRELICS"><i>Ruskin Relics</i></span></a>, 142). 
                    <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> originally wrote this essay for <span class="title-periodical-GOODWORDS"><i>Good Words</i></span>, 
                    a nondenominational Christian magazine with Scottish connections. His observation about <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s chameleon character&#x2014;besides seeming patently untrue&#x2014;likely played to 
                    the magazine&#x02BC;s ecumenical mission. (<span class="title-periodical-GOODWORDS"><i>Good Words</i></span> promised to enliven the dullness of English Sabbatarianism by extending the boundaries 
                    of Sunday devotional reading to include Christian thought in secular genres, especially poetry 
                    &#x005B;see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#EHNESGOODWORDS");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-CEHNES">Ehnes</span>, <span class="title-essay-EHNESGOODWORDS">&#x201C;Religion, Readership, and the Periodical Press&#x201D;</span></a>&#x005D;.) 
                    As an account of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s handwriting, this polemical explanation is interesting 
                    as evidence connected with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s reception around <span class="date-1900">1900</span>, the year of his death, 
                    but the approach seems to have prevented <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> from conveying effectively the intimate knowledge 
                    he must have gathered over the years about the physical family manuscripts, or thinking about that evidence in context of an early nineteenth&#x2010;century, middle&#x2010;class home education.</div>
         
         
         <div class="p">For purposes of contextualizing the manuscripts edited in <i>ERM</i>, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s most untenable assumption is that the story of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s developing handwriting 
                    can be limited to the boy&#x02BC;s precocity and his father&#x02BC;s masculine mercantile discipline, 
                    whereas it was obviously <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> who presided over the scenes of writing 
                    during <span class="persName-JR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s frequent absences on business trips. It is true that, in the family letters, 
                    <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> tended to record events in the development 
                    of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s hand, as if he simply performed these feats unaided&#x2014;like a creature in nature prodding itself to walk upright. 
                    One such benchmark was <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s first use of pen and ink. According to <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>, 
                    this occurred in <span class="date-1827-04">April 1827</span>, but she cuts directly to his accomplishment, omitting the role 
                    she must have played in supplying the writing materials, teaching him to hold a pen, and monitoring his practice: 
                    &#x201C;<span class="persName-JR">John</span> has sent you his first written letter . . . he is much delighted at being able to use pen &#x0026; ink&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/mr_to_jjr_1827-04-28_al_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">Margaret to John James Ruskin, <span class="date-1827-04-28">28 April 1827</span></span></a>

                    on the identify of the &#x201C;first written letter&#x201D;, see

                    From this point, as suggested in <a href="#COPYBOOK">The Ruskins and Copybook Self&#x2010;Culture</a>, 
                    <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> may have appropriated control over this advance in <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s handwriting, treating it as a rite of passage for his son. 
                    But <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s use of pen and ink cannot be neatly compartmentalized, as <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> does in his version of the story, as the sudden adoption &#x201C;under orders&#x201D; 
                    of a male &#x201C;commercial&#x201D; round hand like his father&#x02BC;s. While <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s writing instruction prior to <span class="date-1827">1827</span> goes unmentioned 
                    in the family letters, his first cursive script (<span class="date-1827-1829">1827&#x2013;29</span>) appears to have been modeled on his mother&#x02BC;s.</div>

                        In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, a precedent for typography in children&#x02BC;s books had been set by

                        It is not known if <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was exposed to this text, which <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> like countless mothers may have used to teach him to read when very young

            <div class="p">At the same time, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s pencil print lettering already shows signs of being modeled on favorite books that were not intended for small children. For example, in

                        he imitated the <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/edgeworth_harry_and_lucy_concluded_note.php");?>" target="_self">original&#x02BC;s title page</a>; and in the text, he may have modeled his letters on the serif typeface used for <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s 
                        <span class="date-1825">1825</span> book, even adopting a decorative capital <i>Y</i> from the display type of the title page. 
                        (The lettering suggests Caslon or perhaps the English transitional serif typefaces, such as Baskerville and Bulmer, 
                        which predominated in British books of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.) Another influential model was the <span class="title-series-DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">&#x201C;Dove&#x02BC;s English Classics&#x201D;</span>, 
                        a reprint series of which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> owned volumes of <span class="persName-APOPE">Pope</span>&#x02BC;s translation of the <span class="title-poem-HOMERILIAD"><i>Iliad</i></span> (<span class="date-1824">1824</span>) 
                        and of <span class="persName-JDRYDEN">Dryden</span>&#x02BC;s translation of the <span class="title-poem-VIRGILAENEID"><i>Aeneid</i></span> and other works (<span class="date-1825">1825</span>) by <span class="persName-VIRGIL">Virgil</span>. 
                        At three by five inches, much smaller than the <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span> volumes, 
                        the <span class="title-series-DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">&#x201C;Dove&#x02BC;s English Classics&#x201D;</span> were comparable in size to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/red_book_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span></a>, 
                        but typographically the text was the opposite of <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>&#x02BC;s child&#x2010;friendly large and spacious type. 
                        The densely set lines of verse on small pages resulted in many runovers, which the printer/publisher J. F. Dove managed with a device that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> precisely imitated 
                        when his own poems crowded the margins of his <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/red_book_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span></a>

            <div class="p">Another typographic feature that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> adopted to ornament his printed lettering 
                        was a decorative capital that he called &#x201C;double&#x201D; print. This was formed with a doubled downward or upward stroke, which could be left open or filled wtih shadow. 
                        Examples occur in the earliest fair&#x2010;copy manuscripts, both in the <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/red_book_note.php");?>" target="_self">Red Books</a> and in the separate 
                        presentation copies of poems that were later bound in <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/msia_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span></a> and

                        (see, e.g., the <span class="date-1827-01-01">1 January 1827</span> pencil presentation copy, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/time_blank_verse_msia.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTIMEBLANKVERSE">&#x201C;Papa whats time a figure or a sense&#x201D;</span></a>). 
                        Possible models for the &#x201C;double&#x2010;lettering&#x201D; include a display typeface used on title pages of <span class="title-series-DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">&#x201C;Dove&#x02BC;s English Classics&#x201D;</span> 
                        and a similar engraved lettering used on maps in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s geography book, 
                        <span class="title-book-GOLDSMITHGEOGRAPHY"><i>Geography Illustrated on a Popular Plan</i></span> (<span class="date-1820">1820</span>) by the <span class="persName-RJG">Reverend J. Goldsmith</span>&#x2014;the 
                        author also of a geography text used by the Brontës 
                        (see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 35:79;

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> appears to have derived his double&#x2010;lettering primarily from a serif model, 
                        but he may also have based it on the sanserif typefaces that began as a neoclassical revival in the <span class="date-1780-1789">1780s</span> 
                        and sprang into a variety of forms and associations in the first decades of the nineteenth century 
                        (see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#CRAMSIEGRAPHIC");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-PCRAMSIE">Cramsie</span>, <span class="title-book-CRAMSIEGRAPHIC"><i>Story of Graphic Design</i></span></a>, 117&#x2013;18, 126&#x2013;27). 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> used these decorative printed letter forms until <span class="date-1828-1829">1828&#x2013;29</span>, when his lettering for many texts 
                        became notably smaller, though no less typographical in form&#x2014;the decrease in size perhaps owing to his increasing agility with pen and ink, which he was using by then, but perhaps also to imitating the smaller type in the adult books 
                        he was consuming by then.</div>
            
            
            <div class="p">Examples of earlier, less accomplished print lettering by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> survive (see, e.g., the signature to his so&#x2010;called first letter, 
                        <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/jr_and_mr_to_jjr_1823-03-15_al_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-jr_and_mr_to_jjr_1823-03-15">John Ruskin and Margaret Ruskin to John James Ruskin, 15 March 1823</span></a>), 
                        but the first substantive corpus of juvenilia, which starts in <span class="date-1826">1826</span>, is so consistently and even obsessively well&#x2010;formed in its lettering that the showmanship drew worried comment from <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>. 
                        In a study of writing instruction in colonial <span class="placeName-USA">America</span>, <span class="persName-EJMONAGHAN">E. Jennifer Monaghan</span> notes the disjunction between the point of the writing master&#x02BC;s exercises&#x2014;which was 
                        focused on &#x201C;form&#x201D; and the &#x201C;purely visual properties&#x201D; of handwriting, thus requiring the student &#x201C;to learn 
                        how to represent the words of others&#x201D; in &#x201C;a variety of scripts&#x201D;&#x2014;and the ultimate purpose of writing instruction, 
                        which was to teach &#x201C;a child to express himself&#x201D;

                        <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> turned the writing master&#x02BC;s approach on its head, asking her husband to &#x201C;excuse&#x201D; how <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;showing you&#x201D; the mechanical skill of &#x201C;his writing

                        From the perspective of the nineteenth&#x2010;century child writer, however, what seems a deflection into pedantry may have been a source of empowerment. 
                        Copying a text skillfully sponsored agency, as the seven&#x2010;year&#x2010;old <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> asserted on the title page of

            <div class="p">From the present&#x2010;day reader&#x02BC;s standpoint, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s juvenilia is most interesting 
                        when, rather than straightforwardly copying <span class="persName-ME">Maria Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s dialogues, he adapts the genre to depicting daily life at <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span>. 
                        We are apt to regard it as a failure of inspiration when he reproduces verbatim the text of experiments from <span class="persName-JJ">Jeremiah Joyce</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><i>Scientific Dialogues</i></span>. 
                        However, as <span class="persName-CAA">Christine Alexander</span> comments, nineteenth&#x2010;century child writers appropriated adult voices and their discourses in order to gain 
                        &#x201C;the freedoms of the adult world&#x201D;. Although working &#x201C;within a defined discourse&#x201D; that they found ready made, in doing so child 
                        writers gave &#x201C;an account of both their own and the adult world&#x201D;, empowering themselves 
                        to &#x201C;construct an identity of authorship&#x201D; chosen in &#x201C;response to the print culture of their time&#x201D; 
                        (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#ALEXANDERPLAYANDAPPRENTICESHIP");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-CAA">Alexander</span>, <span class="title-essay-ALEXANDERPLAYANDAPPRENTICESHIP">&#x201C;Play and Apprenticeship&#x201D;</span></a>, 31). 
                        Reproducing typography and obeying its constraints could be a creative exercise.</div>
            
            
            <div class="p">For example, in <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_msi.php");?>" target="_self">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy Concluded&#x201D;</a>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> paradoxically enfranchised his inventiveness 
                        by constraining his lettering within the guidelines of bookmaking. For example, he imitated the justification of printed text, right and left, 
                        but he evidently found it difficult to space his letter&#x2010; and word&#x2010;spacing within a line of prose, so as to end a word on the right&#x2010;justified margin. 
                        He understood that words could be broken at the margin using a hyphen, and he did adopt that expediency. 
                        More often, however, he put that punctuation mark to work in his own way, by deploying it, not to divide words, 
                        but to fill the space between words that falls at the end of a line. Hence, he invented a new punctuation mark&#x2014;or new use 
                        of an existing one&#x2014;in the varying&#x2010;length hyphen. In <i>ERM</i>, the mark is designated as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <i>justification mark</i> 
                        (see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/editorial_rationale_note.php#JUSTIFICATION");?>" target="_self">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology: Element, Attribute, and Value Usage&#x2014;Justification, Runover, and Word Division</a>). 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> continued to use this mark for the purpose of right&#x2010;justifying text at least through <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy of 
                        <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">An Account of a Tour of the Continent</span>.</div>
            
            
            <div class="p">Difficulties could arise when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> set himself particularly exacting imitative or decorative lettering tasks, 
                        such as the elaborate double&#x2010;print lettering for the poem, 
                        <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/a_battle_irregular_measure_apparatus");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRABATTLEIRREGULARMEASURE">&#x201C;A Battle: Irregular Measure&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                        which he apparently failed to complete in time for a holiday presentation to his father (see 
                        <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol3_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-lesson-HARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 3</span></a>). 
                        This problem would be solved by adopting an easier &#x201C;copperplate&#x201D; round hand for fair copies of his poems&#x2014;especially longer poems, 
                        such as <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</span> and <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</span> (<a href="#COPYBOOK">The Ruskins and Copybook Self&#x2010;Culture</a>). 
                        But despite its occasional costs, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would always take pleasure in copying, it seems, and in what the exercise could reveal&#x2014;a quality that perhaps extended later to his drawing.</div>

            <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> probably learned to write in ink using a quill, if trade statistics for the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> 
                        provide a reliable guide. In <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> alone, imported goose quills consumed annually averaged around 20 million, 
                        and the country as a whole used about double that number. However, the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span> 
                        also witnessed the mass production of steel pens&#x2014;referring to what nowadays is typically called the <i>nib</i>, as opposed to the pen&#x2010;holder held in the hand&#x2014;and by <span class="date-1838">1838</span> this output increased to 220 million. In the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>, 
                        manufacturers (chiefly in <span class="placeName-BIRMINGHAM">Birmingham</span>) were improving the flexibility of pens as well producing them in quantities sufficient to lower their retail cost considerably. 
                        Even fountain&#x2010;pens were being patented, although not mass-produced until the end of the century. These alternatives to the traditional quill became more affordable and widely used in the 
                        <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. Quills of any kind were purchased already prepared or &#x201C;dressed&#x201D;; and as the huge consumption suggests, 
                        consumers typically were unskilled in mending a quill for extended use, or unwilling to take the trouble, 
                        preferring merely to discard a dull pen for a fresh one. Steel pens broke easily, but as they became cheaper (dropping from about eighteen shillings per dozen at the start of the century 
                        to about fourpence per gross by <span class="date-1838">1838</span>), these too could be painlessly discarded by the middle&#x2010;class writer

                        or she might have meant his first letter in a cursive hand&#x2014;&#x201C;written&#x201D; as opposed to printed. Or both meanings may have been true.

                        the body of the letter is written in pencil and in a cursive hand, which he apparently already commanded. 
                        At the end of the letter, between the closing and the signature, he exhibited his newly acquired pen skills by inserting a sentence&#x2014;likewise in cursive, but using pen and ink: 
                        &#x201C;mamma says I may tell you I have been a very good boy while you have been away&#x201D;. Following the signture, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> copied his poems,

                        He was exhibiting the range of his pen&#x2010;and&#x2010;ink skills, and possibly also distinguishing between the cursive hand appropriate to a letter, and the imitation of typography appropriate to a poem.</div>

                        This manuscript originated as a fair copy of the poem, using an ink, print&#x2010;lettered hand similar in appearance to the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> fair copy of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span>, which is dated ca. <span class="date-1827-1828">1827&#x2013;28</span> (books 1&#x2013;2). 
                        In the margins, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> revised the poem in a sprawling cursive hand, using both pen and pencil. This version of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span> is undated, 
                        but it certainly predated the <span class="date-1827-1828">late 1827&#x2013;early 1828</span>

                        which incorporates the revisions. The cursive hand is awkward, but recognizably <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s, and legible without difficulty. 
                        Judging by the pencil cursive hand used for the ca. <span class="date-1829-02-1829-05">February&#x2013;May 1829</span> rough draft of

                        round hand called for a looping style that accentuated contrasts of thin and thick strokes, a style related to the late eighteenth&#x2010;century transitional and modern typefaces 
                        that featured these extreme contrasts, such as Baskerville and Bodoni

                        In the eighteenth century, round hand settled into a practical but elegant script that was less elaborate than earlier versions, and that was widely used in business. 
                        In the view of a historian of calligraphy, the common English round hand was &#x201C;colourless, thoroughly unromantic, and dull&#x201D;; however, these &#x201C;were precisely

                            of fair copy in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span>, but is written on two leaves (both sides of each) bound into <span class="title-manuscript-MSSXI">MS XI</span>, 
                            but the hand used for this fair copy appears identical to that used for the poems in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span>. <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> 
                            and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> seem to acknowledge the identical hands by repeating <span class="persName-MRC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s characterization of a 
                            &#x201C;female&#x201C; or &#x201C;lady&#x02BC;s hand, albeit dodging the implication of their &#x201C;query&#x02BC;&#x2014;that if <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> 
                            fair&#x2010;copied the item in <span class="title-manuscript-MSSXI">MS XI</span>, then she also copied the times in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span>.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">The hand is in fact markedly more elegant than <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s, although it does exhibit a few characteristics typical of both hers and 
                            <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s hands, characteristics that are not found in <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s&#x2014;namely, a 
                            long medial <i>s</i> as the first stroke of a double&#x2010;<i>s</i>; and heavy reliance on the ampersand. One might be tempted to ascribe the hand 
                            to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>; however, as <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> point out more helpfully than in what 
                            they&#x02BC;ve so far contributed to the question, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s hand is unquestionably responsible for an attribution and dateline that follow 
                            the prose essay in <span class="title-manuscript-MSSXI">MS XI</span>, &#x201C;<span class="persName-pen_name-JR">J.R.</span> / fragment from a Journal / <span class="date-1833">1833</span>&#x201C;&#x2014;and 
                            this hand definitely contrasts with that of the transcription itself (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <i>Works</i></a>, 2:380 n. 1).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">So we are left with <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span> or possibly another &#x201C;lady&#x201D; as a candidate.</div>
