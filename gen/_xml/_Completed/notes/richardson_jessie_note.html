               <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span>ʼs aunt, sister of <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, married in <span class="date-1804">1804</span> to <a href="/notes/richardson_patrick_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-PR">Patrick Richardson</span> (<span class="date-1774-1824">1774–1824</span>)</a> of <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth, Scotland</span>. 
                    She was the mother of ten children. By the time <span class="persName-JRP">Jessie</span> herself died on <span class="date-1828-05-18">18 May 1828</span>, six of the ten children had also died, 
                    including her namesake <a href="/notes/richardson_jessie_daughter_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-JRPDAUGHTER">Janet</span> (“Jessie”, <span class="date-1820-1827">1820–27</span>)</a>, along with <a href="/notes/richardson_james_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span> (<span class="date-1808-1826">1808–26</span>)</a>, 
                    both of whom were dear to <span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span>. <span class="persName-JRPDAUGHTER">Jessie</span>, who was nearer to <span class="persName-JR">John</span> in age, was a playmate 
                    when the Ruskins visited the family in <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>; and <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span> was an older youth, to whom <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> looked up in boyhood, when <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span> resided at <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span>. 
                    In <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> frames his account of his aunt in terms of child deaths

                    she frequently mentions helping <span class="persName-JRP">Jessie</span> care for these children: “I have been a great deal at <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> 
                    and <span class="persName-JRP">Jessy</span> often here [in <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span>] since her Marriage” (for the Richardson residences in <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>, see 
                    <a href="/notes/richardson_patrick_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-PR">Patrick Richardson</span></a>). 
                    <span class="persName-CTWR">Catherine</span> conveyed the appeal of <span class="persName-JRP">Jessie</span>ʼs children to her “two darlings”, her son <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> 
                    and his cousin, <span class="persName-MCC">Margaret Cock</span>. (<span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> had been making his way in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> since <span class="date-1801">1801</span> at age sixteen, 
                    while in the same year <span class="persName-MCC">Margaret</span> had traveled from <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> to <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span>—and later, <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>—to live with her aunt and uncle and assist them.) 
                    Writing to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> about <span class="persName-JRP">Jessie</span>ʼs eldest boy,

                    she assured her son that he will admire a portrait of this “very fine engaging Child”, commissioned in watercolor from an artist 
                    “famous for doing Children” (probably <span class="persName-WD">William Douglas</span> [<span class="date-1780-1832">1780–1832</span>], well known as a miniaturist). When measles afflicted <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>,

                    <span class="persName-CTWR">Catherine</span> was relieved to be “able to take some of the trouble from <span class="persName-JRP">Jessy</span>” but advised <span class="persName-MCC">Margaret</span>: “We ought to be very Carefull how we grieve for the death of an Infant” 
                    for “if they are taken we are sure they go to Eternal happiness and <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">God</span> only can tell whether they may be spared for A Blessing ar A Curse”

                    might have been acquired for <span class="persName-JR">John</span> as “A Lesson of Piety Affectionately Dedicated to the Young” to contemplate the consequences 
                    of the deaths of his <a href="/notes/richardson_patrick_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-PR">Uncle Patrick</span></a>, his cousins <a href="/notes/richardson_jessie_cousin_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-JRPDAUGHTER">Jessie</span></a> and <a href="/notes/richardson_james_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span></a>, and/or his Aunt <span class="persName-JRP">Jessie</span>. 
                    The tale relates the fate of a Scottish widow who (like <span class="persName-JRP">Jessie Richardson</span>) was reduced in circumstances by the death of her husband, 
                    and who must part with her two sons. One son emigrates to <span class="placeName-USA">America</span> and prospers, and the other son resorts to crime. 
                    The successful son is supported in <span class="placeName-USA">America</span> (as was the Richardson family in <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>) by his kindly uncle, who, like <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, is a prudent merchant. 
                    The book might even have been shared between <span class="persName-JR">John</span> and his cousins <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span> and <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>, when the latter were living at <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> and dependent on <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs charity (see
