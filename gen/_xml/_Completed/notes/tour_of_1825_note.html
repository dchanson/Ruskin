               <div class="p">In <span class="date-1825">1825</span>, when <span class="persName-JR">John</span> was six, the Ruskin family made its first visit to the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span>. 
                    According to <span class="persName-VAB">Van Akin Burd</span>, the family party included <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs nurse, 
                    <a href="/notes/strachan_anne_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-ASB">Anne Strachan</span></a>, who accompanied the family also on the <span class="date-1833">1833</span> Continental journey. 
                    <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> adds that they journeyed between <span class="date-1825-05-11-1825-07-13">11 May and 13 July</span>, 
                    and the itinerary covered <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span>, <span class="placeName-BRUGES">Bruges</span>, <span class="placeName-GHENT">Ghent</span>, <span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span>, and <span class="placeName-PARIS">Paris</span>, including <span class="placeName-VERSAILLES">Versailles</span> 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 1:xxv;

                    As such, the tour was characteristically <span class="date-1799-11-09-1815-06-18">post‐Napoleonic</span>, organized around paying tribute to the Alliesʼ victory on <span class="placeName-">Waterloo Field</span>
                    and witnessing the festivities in <span class="placeName-PARIS">Paris</span> to celebrate the crowning of <span class="persName-KC10">Charles X</span>—the successor to <span class="persName-KL18">Louis XVIII</span> 
                    who died in <span class="date-1824">1824</span>.</div>

                    (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#HAWKINSBYRONCHRONOLOGY" target="_self"><span class="persName-ARHAWKINS">Hawkins</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-HAWKINSBYRONCHRONOLOGY">“The Byron Chronology”</span></a>, years <span class="date-1816-1819">1816–19</span>).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">The coronation of <span class="persName-KC10">Charles X</span> was the first since the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy—<span class="persName-KC10">Charles</span>ʼs brother, <span class="persName-KL18">Louis XVIII</span>, 
                    having died less than a decade after being restored to the throne following the Alliesʼ victory. The ceremony itself took place on <span class="date-1825-05-29">29 May 1825</span> at the <span class="placeName-building-REIMSCATHEDRAL">cathedral</span> in <span class="placeName-REIMS">Reims</span>, 
                    where French monarchs had for centuries traditionally been anointed, and not in <span class="placeName-PARIS">Paris</span>, where <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span> had crowned himself emperor in <span class="placeName-building-NOTREDAMEPARIS">Notre Dame</span>. 
                    While some aspects of the ceremony were updated to take account of political conditions in the Restoration, “the overriding symbolism was that of the pre‐<span class="date-1789">1789</span> monarchy, 
                    with pride of place being given to the clergy and nobility” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#PRICEPERILOUSCROWN" target="_self"><span class="persName-MPRICE">Price</span>, <span class="title-book-PRICEPERILOUSCROWN"><i>Perilous Crown</i></span></a>, 119). 
                    In <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>, where <span class="persName-KC10">Charles</span> had lived in exile in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> and <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span>, 
                    theaters staged replicas of the <span class="placeName-building-REIMSCATHEDRAL">Reims Cathedral</span> ceremony; and in <span class="placeName-PARIS">Paris</span>, 
                    opera houses mounted productions that reflected the spectacle at <span class="placeName-REIMS">Reims</span>, which was in itself deemed by many to be inappropriately operatic in character

               <div class="p">In his travel diary for <span class="date-1833">1833</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> reflected back on this <span class="date-1825">1825</span> journey, 
                    comparing the familyʼs experiences during the much more ambitious Continental <a href="/notes/tour_of_1833_note" target="_self">Tour of <span class="date-1833">1833</span></a>. 
                    On this present visit, he notes that <span class="placeName-PARIS">Paris</span> was “not so gay as in <span class="date-1825-05">May 1825</span>”

                    Following the <span class="date-1830-07-26-1830-07-29">July Revolution of 1830</span> and the abdication of <span class="persName-KC10">Charles X</span>, as a historian remarks, 
                    “a coronation for <span class="persName-KLP1">Louis Philippe</span> was never raised”, even in the tempered form of medievalism surrounding <span class="persName-KC10">Charles X</span>ʼs ceremony, 
                    “and the bourgeoisieʼs king contented himself with his proclamation by the Chamber of Deputies and the swearing of an oath 
                    of fidelity to the <span class="title-law-1814CHARTERFRANCE">Constitutional Charter</span> as his sole inaurgural rite”

                    In his autobiography, <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA">Praeterita</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> acknowledged that the trip was prompted by the coronation festivities, but he remembered nothing of the pomp, 
                    claiming to have been “only interested by things near me, or at least clearly visible and present”, such as the good‐natured servants at the <span class="placeName-PARIS">Paris</span> hotel

               <div class="p">A journey to the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span> may seem ambitious for a middle‐class <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> family, only recently established (since <span class="date-1823">1823</span>) in their new suburban home, 
                    <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span>, and with a young boy to raise and educate. By the <span class="date-1825-1829">mid‐1820s</span>, however, 
                    <span class="geogName-ENGLISHCHANNEL">Channel</span> crossings were common, if limited to the nearby and comparatively inexpensive destination of the <span class="placeName-NETHERLANDS">Kingdom of the Netherlands</span> 
                    (<span class="placeName-BELGIUM">Belgium</span> did not secede and form a nation until <span class="date-1830">1830</span>). Trips expressly to view the <span class="placeName-WATERLOO">Waterloo</span> battlefield
                    had been popular since as early as the weeks immediately following the battle. The popularity had been enhanced by personal visits paid by such well‐known literary figures as 
                    <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>, <span class="persName-RS">Robert Southey</span>, and <span class="persName-GGB">Lord Byron</span>
