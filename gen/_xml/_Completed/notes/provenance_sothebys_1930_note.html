               <div class="p">On <span class="date-1930-07-24">24 July 1930</span>, Sotheby & Co. held an important sale of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs literary remains, 
                    described in the sale catalogueʼs title as the 
                    <a href="/notes/bibliography#SOTHEBYCAT1930" target="_self"><span class="title-catalogue-SOTHEBYCAT1930"><i>Catalogue of the Manuscripts and Remaining Library of <span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span>,

                        and of His Trustees . . . </i></span></a>. 
                    This sale was perhaps the single most consequential event for the provenance of the early manuscripts.</div>

                     <span class="head-subsection">Books from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs Library</span>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">The first 109 lots of the sale contained items from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs library. 
                            More than half the lots (24–83) were devoted to the <span class="title-archive-GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">“<span class="persName-CKG">Kate Greenaway</span> Collection from Brantwood”</span>, 
                            while the remainder ranged from illuminated manuscripts and incunabula to modern first editions and presentation copies. 
                            Sothebyʼs must have anticipated that the <span class="title-archive-GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">Greenaway collection</span> would command interest, 
                            since the firm devoted four of the six plates in the illustrated catalogue to drawings from her books, 
                            as compared with only two plates showing <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscripts. 
                            The expectation was justified, as indicated by a copy of the sale catalogue at the Beinecke Library 
                            that was annotated by an observer. Almost every lot in the <span class="title-archive-GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">Greenaway collection</span> found a buyer, 
                            with the highest price of £420 paid for a collection of autograph letters from <span class="persName-CKG">Greenaway</span> to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">Among the books unrelated to <span class="persName-CKG">Greeanway</span>, a copy of <span class="persName-WBP">William Blake</span>ʼs illustrated edition of 
                            <span class="persName-EY">Young</span>ʼs <span class="title-poem-EYNIGHTTHOUGHTS"><i>Night Thoughts</i></span>, 
                            its engravings “coloured by the artist himself”, fetched £400 from the Maggs Bros. firm. 
                            Otherwise, according to the annotator of the Beinecke copy of the 
                            <span class="title-catalogue-SOTHEBYCAT1930">sale catalogue</span>, the rare book and manuscript dealers Maggs and 
                            Bernard Quaritch acquired a few of the manuscript volumes and modern illustrated volumes, 
                            while other lots either were left unsold or their buyers unrecorded by the annotator. The Beinecke copy of the catalogue 
                            fails to note the sale, for example, of at least two items of incunabula as well as two lots of <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span> novels that, 
                            according to <span class="persName-JSD">James S. Dearden</span>, were purchased by <a href="/notes/whitehouse_j_h_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-JHW">J. H. Whitehouse</span></a>

                            which he singled out perhaps because the <span class="title-catalogue-SOTHEBYCAT1930">catalogue</span> mentions these as containing annotations by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>.</div>

                                        Item 1, the first volume, entitled in the catalogue as “Early Poems”, corresponds to

                                        The catalogue description does not mention that <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span>

                                        even that description had become inaccurate by <span class="date-1930">1930</span>, owing to rebinding

                                        in order to guard against wear.) As the catalogue acknowledges (p. 20), its descriptions of the manuscripts rely on <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs

                                        Only the physical descriptions of size and bindings are additions to <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">“Note”</span> and

                                        or at least the most accessible, bibliographical source, while the <a href="/notes/library_edition_note" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span></a> was not mentioned in the catalogue,

                                                containing “three note books”. Given the existence of this slipcase at the time the catalogue was compiled, the three notebooks can be presumed to be the same as the manuscripts now 
                                                associated with that slipcase in the Beinecke Library, as follows. As in item I.4 above, the catalogue does not draw on existing descriptions that were available in the 
                                                <a href="/notes/library_edition_note" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span></a>, 
                                                although admittedly this information is rather deeply buried in the bibliography volume 
                                                (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 38:206). 
                                                The catalogue describes the notebooks as a group: “74–84–84 pp. containing geological, historical and grammatical notes, 
                                                half roan, 6 × 4 in.” This summary of the contents credibly, if only roughly, corresponds to the Latin grammar, mineralogy, travel itineraries, and sermon drafts in fact 
                                                contained in these manuscripts. The material “half roan” is incorrect, however—the notebooks being full roan, like the 
                                                <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span></a> in I.1–5, above—and the catalogueʼs page count of the notebooks 
                                                only very roughly approximates the 44 leaves, 42 leaves, and 43 leaves respectively found in them, as follows. The catalogue may afford a clue, however, that a 
                                                leaf now missing from the third of these notebooks was still attached at the time of the sale, since that possibility would account for the catalogueʼs identical 
                                                “84–84 pp.” for two of the notebooks.

                            according to the notations in the Beinecke copy of the catalogue. 
                            Prices ranged from £440 for the manuscript of <span class="title-book-JRSTONESOFVENICE"><i>The Stones of Venice</i></span>,

                            <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> took the same approach to the <span class="date-1930">1930</span> Sothebyʼs sale, assisted by B. F. Stevens & Brown as his agent.

                            a portion of <span class="title-book-JRFORS"><i>Fors Clavigera</i></span> (lot 118, £50), and <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span> (£155). His strategy is consistent with the biographical bias 
                            animating collectors of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, who aspired to comprehensive ownership

                  <div class="p">Curiously, in what appears to be the earliest published report describing acquisitions by Yale 
                            from the <span class="date-1930-07">July 1930</span> Sothebyʼs sale, none of these items is mentioned. 
                            Instead, a <span class="date-1931-01">January 1931</span> report in the <span class="title-periodical-YALEGAZETTE"><i>Yale University Library Gazette</i></span> 
                            lengthily describes manuscripts that were not listed in <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>ʼs <span class="date-1930-11">November 1930</span> sale—namely, 
                            lots 110 and 112, consisting of the six bound volumes of Ruskin family letters and the six slipcases containing juvenilia. 
                            In the <span class="title-periodical-YALEGAZETTE"><i>Gazette</i></span>, these items are celebrated as forming 
                            “a considerable portion of the <span class="placeName-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span> collection of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscripts” 
                            which is “now preserved for all time against sale and spoliation” at Yale 
                            (<a href="/notes/bibliography#COLLECTIONRUSKINMANUSCRIPTS" target="_self"><span class="persName-KGWEIHE">Weihe</span>, <span class="title-essay-WEIHERUSKINMANUSCRIPTS">“A Collection of Ruskin Manuscripts”</span></a>, 47). 
                            It is possible that the phrase “considerable portion of the <span class="placeName-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span> collection” is meant also to comprise 
                            the items acquired from <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, and that the writer chose to focus on lots 110 and 112. 
                            Not only would these acquisitions have stood out from the rest by virtue of their striking blue‐morocco casings; 
                            their contents were also notable for their biographical interest, particularly pertaining to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs youth—and in that respect, the writer goes on, “this noteworthy group” of juvenilia and letters 
                            represented “an impressive addition to the Libraryʼs collection of Ruskiniana”, which had been recently augmented 
                            by “the completeness of its first editions and rarity of its items” donated in <span class="date-1929">1929</span> as the <span class="title-archive-RBARUSKINCOLLECTION"><span class="persName-RBA">R. B. Adam</span> Collection</span> 
                            (<a href="/notes/bibliography#COLLECTIONRUSKINMANUSCRIPTS" target="_self"><span class="persName-KGWEIHE">Weihe</span>, <span class="title-essay-COLLECTIONRUSKINMANUSCRIPTS">“A Collection of Ruskin Manuscripts”</span></a>, 47;

                            would have seemed complemented not only by the juvenilia but also by the manuscripts of late works acquired from <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>. 
                            The report seems to testify to a special interest in the early manuscripts, at least among American collectors. It also begs the question of just how these manuscripts 
                            made their way to Yale from the <span class="date-1930-07">1930</span> Sothebyʼs auction.</div> 
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">According to the annotated <span class="title-catalogue-SOTHEBYCAT1930">Sothebyʼs catalogue</span> at the Beinecke, 
                            the successful bids for lots 110 and 112 were placed by <span class="persName-ALLENH">“Allen”</span> (lot 110, £520; lot 112, £260). 
                            That this was a member of the <span class="persName-GA">George Allen</span> family, probably <span class="persName-ALLENH">Hugh Allen</span>, 
                            can be gathered from a letter by <span class="persName-RBROWN">Ralph Brown</span> of B. F. Stevens & Brown 
                            to <span class="persName-JHW">J. H. Whitehouse</span> on the occasion of the <a href="/notes/provenance_severn_1931_note" target="_self">Severn Sale of Ruskin Effects, <span class="date-1931">1931</span></a>: 
                            “we are having the benefit of the assistance of our friend Mr. <span class="persName-ALLENH"> Hugh Allen</span>, 
                            and his help has been invaluable”, as compared with “the lack of interest shown by the Severn family in all matters pertaining to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>” 
                            (quoted in <a href="/notes/bibliography#DEARDENRUSKINBB" target="_self"><span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span>, <span class="title-book-DEARDENRUSKINBB"><i>Ruskin, Bembridge, and Brantwood</i></span></a>, 87). 
                            Beyond the initial purchase of lots 110 and 112 by <span class="persName-ALLENH">Allen</span>, however, the details of the manuscriptsʼ journey 
                            from <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> to <span class="placeName-NEWHAVEN">New Haven</span> are obscured by conflicting evidence.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">According to a <span class="date-1942">1942</span> article, <a href="/notes/bibliography#YALECOLLECTION" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-YALECOLLECTION">“Yale Collection of the Manuscripts of John Ruskin”</span></a>, 
                            by <span class="persName-CBHOGAN">Charles Beecher Hogan</span>, lot 112 containing the twelve “little notebooks” of juvenilia were 
                            “purchased by Mr. <span class="persName-CG">Charles Goodspeed</span>” when they were auctioned “en bloc at Sothebyʼs”, 
                            and “in turn” these items were “purchased by Yale”. If true, it seems odd that <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> 
                            would have commissioned two agents at the sale—<span class="persName-ALLENH">Allen</span>, as well as B. F. Stevens & Brown—unless, for some reason, <span class="persName-ALLENH">Allen</span> acted in concert 
                            with B. F. Stevens & Brown to obtain these two particular lots. Adding to the confusion, <span class="persName-CBHOGAN">Hogan</span> says that the volumes of letters (lot 110) “were purchased by 
                            Yale at the Sotheby auction of <span class="date-1930-07-24">July 24, 1930</span>”—a 
                            vague statement, suggesting either that Yale did not transact through <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> for lot 110, 
                            or that <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>ʼs mediation is to be taken for granted by the reader. The latter assumption should have been clarified 
                            by a footnote specifying that “other items that came from <span class="placeName-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span>, through Sotheby and <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>” have been “marked 
                            with an asterisk”. <span class="persName-CBHOGAN">Hogan</span> does not attach an asterisk to “the magnificent assemblage of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs letters” at Yale, 
                            leading one to the conclusion that Yale acquired the letters, lot 110, directly through the agency of <span class="persName-ALLENH">Hugh Allen</span>, 
                            while lot 112 came roundabout to Yale, from <span class="persName-ALLENH">Allen</span> to <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> to the university library

                            This conclusion seems confirmed by the current (<span class="date-2014-06">June 2014</span>) Beinecke Library 
                     <a href="/notes/bibliography#BEINECKERUSKINFINDINGAID" target="_self">“Guide to the <span class="title-archive-BEINECKERUSKINCOLLECTION">John Ruskin Collection</span>”</a>, 
                            which describes the provenance of the letters laconically as “Bought at Sothebyʼs, <span class="date-1930">1930</span>”, 
                            and the provenance of the juvenilia more specifically as “Bought from Goodspeedʼs Book Shop, Inc., <span class="date-1930">1930</span>”—but 
                            these annotations may have been based <span class="persName-CBHOGAN">Hogan</span>ʼs article, thus representing no additional information.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Nor is further illumination provided by Yaleʼs <a href="/notes/bibliography#KEOGHREPORT_1930-31" target="_self">“Report of the Librarian, <span class="date-1930-07-01-1931-06-30">July 1, 1930–June 30, 1931</span>”</a>,

                            listing “letters written by him to his father” (but not the juvenilia, lot 112) along with the items that formed the documented <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> purchase. 
                            Perhaps the obscurity surrounding these purchases must simply be put down their having been overshadowed by what this same issue of the

                            from the <span class="date-1930">1930</span> Sothebyʼs sale—the letters and juvenilia—he is likely to have taken a keen interest 
                            in these <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> materials, and advised about their acquisition. Sources differ whether <span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span> 
                            was appointed keeper of rare books in <span class="date-1930">1930</span> or <span class="date-1931">1931</span>,

                            credits all the lots from the <span class="date-1930">1930</span> sale, apart from lots 110 and 112, as having been

                            An exception is lot 117, four notebooks containing manuscript of <span class="title-book-JRPROSERPINA"><i>Proserpina</i></span>, 
                            which is listed as “gift of <span class="persName-CBT">Chauncey Brewster Tinker</span>, <span class="date-1930">1930</span>”,

                            Unsurprisingly, then, <span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span> was intimately involved in the <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> transaction, 
                            although details of the arrangement remain to be investigated—for example, whether he held the <span class="title-book-JRPROSERPINA"><i>Proserpina</i></span> manuscript 
                            for himself for a time, or simply donated funds for that portion of the purchase—and the separate provenance of lots 110 and 112 remains a mystery.</div>
