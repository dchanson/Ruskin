                    are <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>ʼs May 10 birthday and New Yearʼs. Of the latter kind of occasional poem, 
                    whether inscribed for presentation on New Yearʼs Eve or on New Yearʼs Day, the earliest surviving example is

                    for a poem earlier than <span class="title-poem-JRTIMEBLANKVERSE">“Time: Blank Verse”</span>, which may have been presented as a New Yearʼs present a year earlier,

                  <span class="head-section">The New Yearʼs Ode Tradition in the <span class="title-periodical-EVANGELICALMAG"><i>Evangelical Magazine</i></span></span>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">A likely source for modeling the New Yearʼs ode, which was available to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in the <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> library, 
                    was the <a href="/notes/evangelical_magazine_note" target="_self"><span class="title-periodical-EVANGELICALMAG"><i>Evangelical Magazine</i></span></a>, 
                    which regularly included New Yearʼs poems in the “Poetry” section for the January issue. Starting with the magazineʼs volume 1 (<span class="date-1793">1793</span>), 
                    monthly issues featured a brief one‐ to two‐page section entitled “Poetry”, consisting of contributions by readers, signed only with their initials, aliases, or home locations. 
                    These small “Poetry” sections, which were included in each monthly issue, may have served <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> as a model for his verse anthologies in his 
                    <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span></a>, small collections that he entitled “Poetry” 
                    similarly to the header used for the collections in the <span class="title-periodical-EVANGELICALMAG"><i>Evangelical Magazine</i></span> (see, e.g., 
                    <a href="/apparatuses/msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-anthology-MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">MS I Poetry Anthology</span></a>).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">From the beginnings of the magazine, the editors encouraged readers to contribute to all departments, especially with “short pieces” such as poems 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#PREFACEEVANGELICALMAG1794-01" target="_self">“Preface” [<span class="date-1794-01">January 1794</span>]</a>). 
                    Readers responded with verse in a variety of genres—descriptive pieces, elegies, epigraphs, devotional poems, hymns, psalm paraphrases, reflections on Bible verses, 
                    doctrinal arguments, “thing” poems, as well as seasonal poems, including Christmas poems for the December issue, 
                    and New Yearʼs poems for the January issue. The final issue of volume one (<span class="date-1793-12">December 1793</span>) featured contributorsʼ poems on the Nativity, 
                    while the opening issue of volume two (<span class="date-1794-01">January 1794</span>) presented contributorsʼ poems on the New Year; and that pattern was sustained in subsequent volumes. 
                    In each annual volume, the New Year holiday appears to have invited more verse commentary compared to Christmas (and other holy days are rarely noticed at all). 
                    New Yearʼs poems are also often complemented with reflections in prose in other sections of the issue, as well. For example, in the <span class="date-1794-01">January 1794</span> issue, 
                    an essay urges readers to solemnize their minds “when . . . brought <i>to the close of the year</i>” since, 
                    despite all “sagacity”, one “cannot ascertain what events may befal me <i>in the progress of that upon which, at present, I am about to enter!</i>” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#SUITABLEMEDITATIONEVANGELICALMAG1794-01" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-SUITABLEMEDITATIONEVANGELICALMAG1794-01">“Suitable Meditation for the Beginning of the Year”</span></a>, 29).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">The New Yearʼs poems are religious, like almost all of the poetry published in the magazine, and they tend to develop predictable themes—for example, the 
                        shortness of time in which to live a holy life; praise of the <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">Creator</span> for time and the seasons; 
                        the superiority of spiritual gifts over material holiday presents. 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs New Yearʼs poems do not typically reflect these religious and admonitory themes.
                    </div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">One of the first New Yearʼs poems, featured in the January issue of volume two, was authored by a writer using the pen name <span class="persName-pen_name-ALIQUIS">Aliquis</span>—a contributor 
                        included among the magazineʼs first poets in volume one, and continuing as a reliable presence for years afterward, leading one to speculate that 
                        the writer may have been a member of the editorial staff, perhaps one among the twenty‐four Ministers from multiple denominations who founded the magazine 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#ALIQUISNEWYEAREVANGELICALMAG1794-01" target="_self"><span class="persName-ALIQUIS">Aliquis</span>, <span class="title-poem-ALIQUISNEWYEAREVANGELICALMAG1794-01">“The New Year”</span></a>). 
                        <span class="persName-pen_name-ALIQUIS">Aliquis</span> went on to supply a New Yearʼs poem annually for almost four decades, the poetʼs last ode being published in <span class="date-1832">1832</span>. 
                        The earlier New Yearʼs poems by <span class="persName-pen_name-ALIQUIS">Aliquis</span>, similarly to those contributed by other poets to the January issues, are lyric “reflections” and “thoughts” of a speaker, 
                        looking back on oneʼs shortcomings in the preceding year and resolving to do better in the coming year. Some of <span class="persName-pen_name-ALIQUIS">Aliquis</span>ʼs earlier efforts stand out from the couplets and quatrains 
                        that typify the other poems, by aspiring to formal complexity with a six‐line stanza that alternates quatrameter rhyming couplets in lines 1–2 and 4–5 with rhyming trimeter lines 3 and 6. 
                        Then, with the New Yearʼs poem for <span class="date-1804">1804</span>—notably, the year of the “Great Terror”, when British citizens watched with horror 
                        as <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span> massed troops and a flotilla on the French coast of the <span class="geogName-ENGLISHCHANNEL">English Channel</span>, in preparation for invasion—<span class="persName-ALIQUIS">Aliquis</span> expanded the poem from a lyric reflection into an ode, 
                        consisting of three divisions of thought subtitled “Reflection”, “Contrition”, and “Praise”—each section composed using distinct metrical patterns
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#ALIQUISODEFORTHENEWYEAREVANGELICALMAG1804-01" target="_self"><span class="persName-pen_name-ALIQUIS">Aliquis</span>, <span class="title-poem-ALIQUISODEFORTHENEWYEAREVANGELICALMAG1804-01">“Ode for the New Year”</span></a>; 
                        on the “Great Terror”, see <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/the_defiance_of_war_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHEDEFIANCEOFWAR">“The Defiance of War”</span></a>).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-pen_name-ALIQUIS">Aliquis</span> goes on to elaborate this ode structure in New Yearʼs poems for subsequent January issues through <span class="date-1832">1832</span>, 
                        most laid out in this ambitious multipart format. Accordingly, for those January issues, <span class="persName-pen_name-ALIQUIS">Aliquis</span>ʼs ode either fills the entirety 
                        of the normally modest one‐ to two‐page monthly allotment to poetry or it bursts the limits, allowing for contributions by others, as well, to occupy several pages of anthology. 
                        Presumably, in order to have been showcased on this scale, <span class="persName-ALIQUIS">Aliquis</span>ʼs niche performance was welcomed as a holiday tradition by the magazineʼs editors and readers. 
                        Thus, while nothing is known of <span class="persName-pen_name-ALIQUIS">Aliquis</span>ʼs identity, this poetʼs career perhaps presents an example of an amateur poet of moderate skill who achieved modest fame within a pious and respectable circle—a 
                        possible way of viewing <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs career, had he stayed on his path of writing verse for the annuals.</div>
