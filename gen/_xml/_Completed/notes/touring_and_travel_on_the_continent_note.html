                        since more rapid crossings were made possible by the rise of steam packet lines. The steam packets accommodated large excursion parties 
                        along with individual travelers, providing amenities such as food and drink and even entertainment, with music performance being common onboard

                        For travelers of modest means, the steam lines greatly increased the efficiency, reliability, and carrying capacity, improvements that were critical 
                        for travelers who could take holidays from employment only on a limited budget and for definite periods—a point expressly made

                        in their huge jackboots—big as barrels and rimmed with iron to protect their legs—was a frequent subject of commentary

                        objected to post horses taken “from the field, the cart, or the plough” and presenting “a worse appearance

                        while the postilion cut no “less extraordinary figure than his horses. His enormous boots, weighing from 5 to 7 pounds each, 
                        in which there is room for two legs of ordinary size—his powdered hair and long pigtail—his enormous whip, 
                        in the smacking of which he makes the most wonderful evolutions over his head, and the most terrible noise that can be imagined, 
                        and by the regulation of which, on principles known to themselves, he apprises the postmaster as he enters a town or village, 
                        whether the travellers be French or English, and whether they pay well or ill—altogether make up so grotesque a figure”

                  <div class="p">On the <a href="/notes/tour_of_1833_note" target="_self">Tour of 1833</a>, the young travelers soon got into the spirit of English bemusement 
                        and exasperation over the figure of the French postilion—<span class="persName-">Ruskin</span>, in the satirical essay,

                        and his cousin, <span class="persName-">Mary Richardson</span>, in her travel diary. At the start of the tour, Mary 
                        was “much amused with the postillion cracking his whip very loud” to encourage his “most miserable looking animals”, but she soon 
                        professed weariness over “waiting a long time as usual” for horses as “for every thing in this country”. In a set piece flavored 
                        with Dickensian irony, she narrates the upset caused by an incompetent postilion who, as “a coachman” and unused “to ride on horseback”, 
                        “got frightened and trembled all over” and nearly ran their horses into a shop, 
                        bringing a crowd into the street to surround and burden the carriage with assistance. He was replaced by a postilion affecting such nonchalance that, 
                        “with the greatest coolness . . . [he] stopped 20 times to sort something or other” with the tackle. In general, she concludes 
                        disapprovingly, “[i]n France and Belgium, the postillions stop in the middle of every stage, if only five miles, to get beer or brandy”, 
                        cracking their whips on approach to a place where someone would always bring them their refreshment”

                        the Ruskins carried guidebooks on their tours abroad. In the <span class="date-1820-1835">1820s through the mid‐1830s</span>
                        guidebooks, like middle‐class travel generally, were undergoing a transition. The vade‐mecum for English travelers

                        did not become available until <span class="date-1836">1836</span>. Whereas <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span>ʼs 
                        <span class="title-book-MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><i>Hand‐book</i></span> is now often credited with founding the genre of the modern English travelerʼs guidebook, 
                        for earlier journeys like the Ruskinsʼ, taken after the reopening of the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span> following the <span class="date-1815-06-18">Battle of <span class="placeName-WATERLOO">Waterloo</span></span> in  
                        <span class="date-1815-1836">1815 and continuing through the mid‐1830s</span>, travelers often relied on publications that combined personal travel narrative with some practical advice. 
                        As <span class="persName-PF">Pieter François</span> has shown, in the period prior to the publication of <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span>ʼs <span class="title-book-MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><i>Hand‐book</i></span>, 
                        there appeared numerous examples of the guidebook genre, particularly relating to the Low Countries, but in an emergent and somewhat inchoate form. 
                        Only gradually, after <span class="date-1815-06-18">Waterloo</span>, the modern guidebook emerged as a genre distinct from the so‐called 
                        <i>travel account</i>, in that the guidebook came to offer mainly practical travel advice, 
                        whereas the more traditional travel account emphasized topographical description and narrative from an individual perspective 
                        (albeit not too individualistic, lest decorum and authority seem to succumb to eccentricity). In the immediate post‐Waterloo period, 
                        these genres were often mixed in the same book, with traces of the <span class="date-1701-1800">eighteenth‐century</span> travel account governing the narrative (for example, in the adoption of an epistolary form), 
                        while tables of practical advice were added to recommend the book in a crowded field

                        which was published on the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span> by Galignani, approached closely

                        (<span class="date-1800">1800</span>), had been “felt by many before the rise of the Murray 
                        and Baedeker guides to be the best available vade‐mecum for <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>”. 
                        This work, <span class="persName-JB">Buzard</span> remarks, “was by no means single‐mindedly devoted to the role of ‘handbook’”. 
                        It was characteristic of the transitional period of travel writing, in having “the appearance, 
                        when we look back at it with generic presuppositions founded on Murray and Baedeker, 
                        of an impressionistic ‘travel book’”—that is, as still relying, despite its “serving as a makeshift [modern] ‘handbook’ 
                        in the absence of any alternative”, on such <span class="date-1701-1800">eighteenth‐century</span> conventions as a series of letters containing the travelerʼs personal impressions
