               <div class="p"><span class="persName-RBA">Robert Borthwick Adam II</span> of <span class="placeName-BUFFALO">Buffalo, New York</span>, inherited and dramatically expanded the book collection of his uncle, 
                    <span class="persName-RBAI">Robert Borthwick Adam I</span> (<span class="date-1833-1904">1833–1904</span>), a native of <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> who emigrated to the <span class="placeName-USA">United States</span> in the <span class="date-1850-1859">1850s</span> 
                    and established a successful and respected dry goods business in <span class="placeName-BUFFALO">Buffalo</span>, which he expanded to a major department store. 
                    The senior <span class="persName-RBAI">Adam</span> and his wife being childless, they adopted his namesake nephew, then nine, and his sister from <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>. 
                    For both father and son, the main focus of the book collection was <span class="persName-SJ">Samuel Johnson</span> and his circle, 
                    but <span class="persName-RBAI">Adam</span> senior collected other writers, including <span class="persName-RBURNS">Robert Burns</span> and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>; 
                    and while it was the <span class="persName-SJ">Johnson</span> collection that earned the Adamses of <span class="placeName-BUFFALO">Buffalo</span> world‐wide fame, 
                    <span class="persName-RBA">Adam II</span> remained committed also to the <span class="persName-RBURNS">Burns</span> and <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span> until about <span class="date-1923-1924">1923–24</span>

               <div class="p">In the <span class="date-1920-1929">1920s</span>, <span class="persName-RBA">Adam II</span> decided to sell his <span class="persName-RBURNS">Burns</span> and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collections, in order to devote his attention solely 
                    to <span class="persName-SJ">Johnson</span> and the eighteenth century. (Tragically, he would be forced by the stock market crash of <span class="date-1929-10">October 1929</span> 
                    to break up his <span class="persName-SJ">Johnson</span> collection, as well.) In <span class="date-1923">1923</span>, he sent the <span class="title-archive-RBARUSKINCOLLECTION"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collection</span> to the firm of the rare book and manuscript dealer, 
                    <span class="persName-ASWR">A. S. W. Rosenbach</span> (<span class="date-1876-1952">1876–1952</span>) in <span class="placeName-NEWYORK">New York</span>. The firm attempted to interest <span class="persName-HEH">Henry Huntington</span> (<span class="date-1850-1927">1850–1927</span>) in the collection, 
                    but it remained unsold for six years, when, in <span class="date-1929-04">April 1929</span>, <span class="persName-RBA">Adam</span> retrieved it for presentation to Yale University Library. 
                    He donated the collection in memory of his adopted father, who started it, but he also wished to support the efforts 
                    by his good friend, <a href="/notes/tinker_c_b_note" target="_self">Chauncey B. Tinker (<span class="date-1876-1963">1876–1963</span>)</a>, 
                    to build up the Yale libraryʼs rare books and manuscripts department

               <div class="p">In a <span class="date-1929">1929</span> issue of the <span class="title-periodical-YALEGAZETTE"><i>Yale University Library Gazette</i></span>, the <span class="title-archive-RBARUSKINCOLLECTION"><span class="persName-RBA">Adam</span> <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collection</span> was described as constituting 
                    “virtually the whole body of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs works, from the earliest to the latest, just as they were first issued: 
                    <i>editiones principes</i> literally by the score, rare pamphlets, 
                    occasional addresses, unique copies,—everything that might be needed . . . for the professional scholar 
                    bent upon a thorough and serious study in the works of <span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span>”. The article acknowledged, however, 
                    that <span class="persName-RBA">Adam</span> had previously sold off “some of the rarest items”, including two copies of the 
                    <a href="/notes/poems_1850_note" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1850"><i>Poems</i></span> (<span class="date-1850">1850</span>)</a>, 
                    as well as “several autograph letters and manuscripts, which added luster to Mr. <span class="persName-RBA">Adam</span>ʼs library, but had no essential place,
                    perhaps, in the collection that has just been given to Yale”. The article ascribes the sale of these <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> items, 
                    not to the Rosenbach firm, but to an auction at the Anderson Galleries in <span class="date-1926-02">February 1926</span>—a major disposal of over 400 lots 
                    of non‐Johnsonian materials and some Johnsonian, of which 38 items related to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, according to the <span class="title-periodical-YALEGAZETTE"><i>Gazette</i></span> 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#FRENCHADAMCOLLECTION" target="_self"><span class="persName-RDFRENCH">French</span>, <span class="title-essay-FRENCHADAMCOLLECTION">“The R. B. Adam Collection of Ruskin”</span></a>, 1, 6;

                    The relation of these offerings in <span class="date-1926">1926</span> to what had been turned over to <span class="persName-ASWR">Rosenbach</span> in <span class="date-1923">1923</span> is not clear.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Nonetheless, the remaining collection given to Yale was so large that the annual <span class="title-periodical-KEOGHREPORT">“Report of the Librarian”</span> for <span class="date-1928-1929">1928–29</span> 
                    reflected difficulty getting a grip on the numbers of items. First listed in the <span class="title-periodical-KEOGHREPORT">“Report”</span> as consisting of 
                    “over three hundred and seventy volumes by and about <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>”, elsewhere in the same annual report 
                    the gift is numbered at “some 500 volumes and pamphlets”. Six years later, “after an unusual amount of bibliographical study and revision”, 
                    another annual <span class="title-periodical-KEOGHREPORT">“Report”</span> set the total at “464 volumes and 271 pamphlets”, although it is unclear whether these figures refer solely to the <span class="persName-RBA">Adam</span> bequest

               <div class="p">Like <span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span>, <span class="persName-RBA">Adam</span> was generous to scholars who requested access to his collections for research. <span class="persName-SJ">Johnson</span> scholars in particular 
                    benefited from access to and even loan of his possessions, so it is possible that scholars may have taken advantage 
                    of <span class="persName-RBA">Adam</span>ʼs <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collection as well, before it came to Yale. <span class="persName-CGO">Charles Grosvenor Osgood</span> (<span class="date-1871-1964">1871–1964</span>),

                    and <span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span>ʼs graduate students were granted access to <span class="persName-RBA">Adam</span>ʼs collections as well
