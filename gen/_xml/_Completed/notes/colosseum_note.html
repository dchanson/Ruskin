                  <div class="p">The <span class="placeName-building-COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</span> in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> was a vast structure built 
                    <span class="date-1824-1826">1824–26</span> to house an ambitious circular, painted panorama of <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, 
                    along with other entertainments. The panorama was based on drawings by <span class="persName-THP">Thomas Hornor</span> (<span class="date-1785-1844">1785–1844</span>), 
                    a multi‐talented surveyor, cartographer, and landscape designer. <span class="persName-THP">Hornor</span> made his drawings circa <span class="date-1820-1823">1820–23</span>, 
                    while daringly housed atop scaffolding erected at the summit of <span class="placeName-building-STPAULCATHEDRAL">St. Paulʼs Cathedral</span>.
                    The drawings were transferred to canvas by the painter, <span class="persName-ETP">E. T. Parris</span>, who worked section by section on an enormous canvas stretched 
                    inside the <span class="placeName-building-COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</span> dome. The sections were then painted by <span class="persName-ETP">Parris</span> 
                    along with other artists between <span class="date-1825-1829">1825 and 1829</span>. The completed work was believed to be “in effect the largest 
                    oil painting the world had ever seen”, exhibited inside “the largest [dome] in the land”, which was “even larger than that on 
                    <span class="placeName-building-STPAULCATHEDRAL">St. Paulʼs</span>, as . . . proprietors never tired of telling their public”. 
                    Inside the dome, visitors were able to view the panorama by ascending to a lower sight level and to an upper sight level, reached either by stairs or by an “ascending room”—the cityʼs 
                    first passenger elevator. In order to raise funds, the panorama exhibition opened prematurely in <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, before the painting and other exhibits 
                    were quite finished, and the project would not be fully realized in its first instantiation until <span class="date-1832">1832</span>. Soon after the opening 
                    in <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, <span class="persName-THP">Hornor</span> went bankrupt and fled to <span class="placeName-USA">America</span>,

                    and their associated buildings. The <span class="placeName-building-COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</span> was built in the southwest corner of

                    In keeping with the neoclassical terraces, the <span class="placeName-building-COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</span> was designed by <span class="persName-DB">Decimus Burton</span>

                    plans were informed by the taste for the picturesque, which his former partner, the landscape designer <span class="persName-HR">Humphry Repton</span> (<span class="date-1752-1818">1752–1818</span>), 
                    had promoted in giving shape to numerous estates (albeit while embroiled in controversy with theorists of the picturesque, <span class="persName-UP">Uvedale Price</span> [<span class="date-1747-1829">1747–1829</span>]

                    complemented these park settings with picturesque cottages and villas in a wide range of styles, from structures that he modeled on a “picture” in the strict sense 
                    of drawing inspiration from structures depicted in the Italian campagna scenes by <span class="persName-CLAUDE">Claude Lorrain</span>; to irregular, castellated dwellings; 
                    to thatch cottages; and most exotically, to the “Indian” forms of <span class="placeName-building-BRIGHTONPAVILION">Brighton Pavilion</span>, 
                    which he conceived for the <span class="persName-KG4">Prince Regent</span>

                    <span class="persName-JN">Nash</span> landscaped the park as a picturesque setting to showcase (yet another) palace for the <span class="persName-KG4">Prince Regent</span>, 
                    as well as a grand church to serve as a “Valhalla” for the nationʼs heroes. These structures were never realized, but more significantly the plan 
                    sponsored the design and construction of numerous urban villas—a new kind of urban residence set in Reptonian picturesque landscaping, 
                    each villa invisible to its neighbor. Some of the first of these villas were designed by <span class="persName-DB">Decimus Burton</span>, the architect of the <span class="placeName-building-COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</span>, 
                    whose work spanned a wide range of what could be considered a villa—so wide that <span class="persName-DA">Dana Arnold</span> characterizes <span class="persName-DB">Burton</span>ʼs ideas as 
                    “a state of mind as . . . [the houses] offered their occupants a retreat from the rigours of life in the metropolis”
