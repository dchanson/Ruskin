               <div class="p">For bibliographical details describing the copy of this book owned by the Ruskins, see 
                    <a href="/notes/boyhood_books_note#WIDOW" target="_self">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth</a>. 
                    In the Ruskin family, the tale would have served—in the terms of the bookʼs subtitle—as “A Lesson of Piety Affectionately Dedicated to the Young”; and its lessons may have been considered appropriate not only 
                    for <span class="persName-JR">John</span> but also for his cousins who survived the deaths of their parents, <a href="/notes/richardson_patrick_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-PR">Patrick</span></a> and <a href="/notes/richardson_jessie_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-JRP">Jessie Richardson</span></a> of <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>. 
                    The role in the tale of the benevolent American merchant‐uncle may have strikingly suggested the generous support that <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> 
                    lent to <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs orphaned cousins.

                     <div class="p"><span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHMRSSTEWART">Mrs. Stewart</span>, who had lived in a respectable sphere of life in <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>, becomes a widow; 
                                and as her husband died insolvent, no reversion is left for her and her two orphan children, 
                                <span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHGILBERTSON">Gilbert</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHALLANSON">Allan</span>. She parts with most of her now useless furniture, and retires with her sons to a small cottage 
                                in <span class="placeName-ROSNEATH">Roseneath</span>; “where seeking a solace to her griefs in works of piety and affection, she devoted herself diligently 
                                to the care of their instruction”, and in bringing them up in the ways of truth and goodness. Thus consoling herself 
                                in her misfortunes under the influence of religion, and firmly believing that the <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">God</span> who governs the world 
                                never chastens unkindly, she submits in pious resignation to his sovereign will.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">Years roll on, and the period arrives when it becomes necessary that her children should go forth 
                                to some employment in the world. <span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHGILBERTSON">Gilbert</span>, her eldest son, a boy about fifteen years of age, is destined for <span class="placeName-USA">America</span>, 
                                in the employ of an affectionate uncle; and <span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHALLANSON">Allan</span>, about fourteen, is to be apprenticed to a goldsmith in <span class="placeName-GREENOCK">Greenock</span>. 
                                They leave their widowed mother with accumulated anguish upon her wrinkled brow. They embark—the fond parent becomes 
                                inconsolable at her additional bereavement—she revives;—but she no longer embraces them with maternal tenderness, 
                                for they are beyond her reach; and all her concern is, how they will preserve those pious habits which she had endeavoured 
                                to impress upon their minds, and avoid the dread infection of temptation and of crime, to which it would be their lot 
                                to be exposed.</div>

                                <span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHGILBERTSON">Gilbert</span>ʼs uncle meets him on the quay, and welcomes his young nephew to the shores of <span class="placeName-USA">America</span>: 
                                every thing looks auspicious. After spending nearly three years upon the beautiful banks of the <span class="geogName-HUDSONRIVER">Hudson</span>, 
                                and having raised himself high in the estimation of his kind relative and benefactor, 
                                by his attentive conduct and exemplary deportment, <span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHSTEWARTUNCLE">Mr. Stewart</span> (the uncle) having some business to transact 
                                in <span class="placeName-GLASGOW">Glasgow</span>, determines to entrust his faithful nephew, <span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHGILBERTSON">Gilbert</span>, with the important commission; 
                                at the same time appointing him to be the bearer of an invitation to his mother and brother <span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHALLANSON">Allan</span>, 
                                to take up their abode in <span class="placeName-NEWYORK">New York</span>.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p"><span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHGILBERTSON">Gilbert</span> embarks with the pleasing intelligence;—he sets his feet once more 
                                on Scottish ground; he looks forward with anxious solicitude again to embrace his best of parents. 
                                As he approaches nearer home, he redoubles his eager steps—at last, his eye catches in the distance 
                                his widowed motherʼs dwelling—he presses onward—he beholds the cottage door, but sees not his parent 
                                upon her wonted seat. His heart beats high with doubt and suspense—every filial emotion is excited—scarcely 
                                a tiny vapour from the chimney tells that there is an inhabitant within. He lightly raises the latch—he 
                                witnesses his mother once again in the weeds of her widowhood, but, insensible of his return, 
                                and wringing her hands in agony, and her eyes drowned in tears. He inquires the cause of such lamentation; 
                                the mother identifies his voice; she looks upward, and, in a compound paroxysm of ecstasy and grief, 
                                beholds her son <span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHGILBERTSON">Gilbert</span>; but nature cannot sustain the struggle. At length he extorts the fact, 
                                that his brother <span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHALLANSON">Allan</span> is incarcerated in a dungeon, and is to be tried on the morrow for forgery 
                                on the Greenock Bank.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">The widowed mother and her pious son repair with hurried steps to the prison‐house, 
                                to catch one glance of their son and brother. She lies down to sleep; but the still darkness of midnight 
                                affords her no repose: images of terror, dungeons, gibbets, and executioners, rise in her feverish dreams; 
                                and the only balm to her racking mind is to call upon <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">God</span> to preserve his life; to interpose his grace, 
                                and save his precious soul. They arrive in <span class="placeName-GLASGOW">Glasgow</span>, and behold the streets unusually crowded;—they witness 
                                the lords justiciary passing to the court‐house. They hurry to the jail, and inquire for <span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHALLANSON">Allan Stewart</span>; 
                                but admittance is denied them, as he is summoned to the bar, to be put first upon trial. 
                                With much urgent solicitation, they obtain a place in court; they immediately fix their eyes upon the bar 
                                where the culprits stand; but no prisoner is there. They turn pale, and tremble—they shrink from every sound 
                                of the coming footsteps. <span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHALLANSON">Allan</span> at last appears as the criminal between the liveried officers. 
                                The indictment is read; <span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHALLANSON">Allan</span> pleads Not Guilty!—the trial proceeds—the evidence is unquestionable;—not 
                                even a motherʼs fondness can deny that the charge looks black against him. The verdict of the jury 
                                is unanimous and unhesitating. The solemn word of “Guilty” is recorded. The judge pronounces the awful sentence; 
                                and implores him to pass the remainder of his time in genuine repentance and Christian meditation.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">They visit him in his gloomy abode, chained in fetters. The interview is melting. <span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHGILBERTSON">Gilbert</span> and his mother urgently intreat him 
                                to seek remission of his sins through the blood of the <span class="persName-scriptural-JESUSCHRIST">Saviour</span>; and endeavour to dissipate, by the radiance of Christian faith, 
                                the fearful cloud of <span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHALLANSON">Allan</span>ʼs despair. Time rapidly advances—and poor <span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHALLANSON">Allan</span>ʼs life is drawing to a close. 
                                Three sleepless nights remain, and the destined morning will arrive, when the heavens shall be clothed with sackcloth. 
                                <span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHGILBERTSON">Gilbert</span> and his mother hasten once more to the dreary dungeon; and in unutterable anguish at the thought of <span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHALLANSON">Allan</span>ʼs speedy dissolution, 
                                endeavour to console him with the unspeakable comforts of religion; but powerful nature seems to invade, as it were, 
                                the still more powerful empire of religious trust. A pardon, however, unexpectedly arrives; <span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHGILBERTSON">Gilbert</span> conveys the pleasing 
                                intelligence to his disconsolate parent; but she cannot survive the past overwhelming shock; she closes her eyes in death, 
                                before her liberated son reaches her abode.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Thus have we hastily glanced at the history of the pious <span class="persName-fictional-ROSENEATHMRSSTEWART">widow of <span class="placeName-ROSNEATH">Roseneath</span></span>, 
                                and with much pleasure we recommend it to the perusal of our readers.
                            We have already stated that it is a work of fiction; but it has none of the unmeaning and ungovernable incidents 
                                of an overdrawn romance, which has seldom any thing to recommend it but the delusions of a disordered or uncultivated mind—the 
                                visionary speculations of a fanciful imagination—wild in its scenery—improbable in its situations—distorted 
                                in its character—inconsistent with itself—and baneful in its tendency;—but it is a work which bears 
                                so close an approximation to real life itself, as it is continually verified by our own daily observation, 
                                that it might well pass current as a narrative of fact, had not our author apprised us of the contrary.
