               <div class="p">Between <span class="date-1826-1828">1826 and 1828</span>, astronomy featured prominently in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poetry and prose, 
                    from his first mention of the typical beginner&#x02BC;s constellation for British children, <span class="name--CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</span>, 
                    in the <span class="date-1826-1827">1826/27</span> poem, 
                    &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/apparatuses/glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-poem-GLENOFGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; &#x005B;&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;&#x005D;</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;; 
                    to his cataloguing of constellation names from all around the celestial globe in the <span class="date-1827-1828">1827/28</span> poem,

                    to the task of memorizing constellation names and their respective numbers of stars, which is assigned to his character <span class="persName-LUCY">Lucy</span> in the <span class="date-1828-1829">1828/29</span> dialogue, 
                    &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_apparatus" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III&#x201D;</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;;
                    to his Miltonic hymn of praise to the sun in the &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/new_years_poems_note" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;New Year&#x02BC;s poem&#x003C;/a&#x003E; for <span class="date-1828-01-01">January 1828</span>,

                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composed these works in context of rising popular education in astronomy for adults and children 
                    in the <span class="date-1800-1839">first three decades of the nineteenth century</span> in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>. 
                    On the evidence of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s writing about astronomy, he was engaged more by the poetic sublimity of the subject than by the science, 
                    although the works contain hints that he gained at least a basic conceptual understanding of the apparent rotations of the solar system and the fixed stars.</div>

                            and there follow lists of constellation names paired with their respective numbers of stars. The identity of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;lesson book&#x201D; has so far eluded detection 
                            since <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span>&#x02BC;s totals of stars fail to match the numbers given in British astronomy texts commonly available in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>. 
                            The counts of observable stars within the constellation boundaries changed over time, and the constellations themselves 
                            changed as new ones were added and others consigned to obsolescence, so it is not necessarily surprising that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s source remains unidentified. 
                            It is also possible that he devised his own method of counting stars, such as numbering only stars of a certain magnitude that he found on a celestial globe or star chart. 
                            Whatever the case, the kind of text normally associated with this exacting information was a <i>star atlas</i>.</div>

                            which included lessons and exercises aimed at &#x201C;beginners, rather than . . . adepts in the science&#x201D;, and which was

                            <span class="persName-AJ">Jamieson</span>&#x02BC;s atlas boasted a dedication to the king, <span class="persName-">George IV</span>, and it could compete credibly with the French and German atlases then in common use.

                            when he was sixteen, the Ruskins may have acquired a different textbook by <span class="persName-AJ">Jamieson</span>,

                                            and ornamented, and gilded: but what is there in all these things to be compared with the sight of these luminous bodies that adorn every part of the sky?&#x003C;br/&#x003E;&#x003C;br/&#x003E;

                                While often emphasizing the aesthetic side of astronomy, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> does not often rise to a rhapsodic mode.

                                    &#x201C;habit of self&#x2010;control . . . by inspiring &#x005B;a boy&#x005D; in his own mind the wish to control himself&#x201D;. 
                                    By this means, when a youth leaves home for school, parents can rely on their son&#x02BC;s self&#x2010;discipline to guard against temptations to dissipation

                                    himself ventures on this &#x201C;&#x2018;very ingenious thing, exceedingly ingenious&#x2019;&#x201D;. Although he sets forth without learning even &#x201C;half . . . &#x005B;of the planets&#x02BC;&#x005D; motions&#x201D;, 
                                    having neglected the <span class="persName-fictional-ENGINEERME">Engineer</span>&#x02BC;s assignment of readings in <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-">Scientific Dialogues</span>, he believes he could teach himself, like <span class="persName-JFERGUSON">Ferguson</span>, &#x201C;as he went on with his work&#x201D;; 
                                    and his mother, unaware of the extent of <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span>&#x02BC;s ambitions, allows him to proceed, so that he &#x201C;will soon find out, by your own experience, what you can, and what you cannot do&#x201D;. 
                                    While he at least sticks to a single project, the complexity of the orrery soon exceeds <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span>&#x02BC;s abilities, and he nearly disgraces himself in reciting his appointed studies. 
                                    His father counsels him: &#x201C;&#x2018;I would rather, . . . as your father and friend, . . that you had the power of keeping to your resolutions, 
                                    than that you made the most ingenious thing that ever was thought of by a boy of your age&#x2019;&#x201D;

                        <div class="p">The dialogue recognizes that learning complex sciences calls on abilites and virtues that can conflict with one another&#x2014;ingenuity and resolution, enthusiasm and steadiness. 
                                    As <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMAME">Mamma</span> admits to <span class="persName-fictional-MARYME">Mary</span>: &#x201C;&#x2018;It is rather hard, I allow, . . . to reproach poor <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> at the same moment with two seemingly opposite faults, 
                                    with his not finishing any thing, and with his being too eager to finish one thing&#x2019;&#x201D;. In the tale&#x02BC;s primary mission to instruct a child&#x02BC;s self&#x2010;command, however, 
                                    the point of an episode of conflict is less to resolve competing virtues philosophically than for the child to internalize regulation of feeling. 
                                    As <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> promises in future to portion his time judiciously between fundamental lessons and ingenious projects, 
                                    his stirred &#x201C;feelings of this moment would have inclined him to do too much, and to fix upon too many hours for <i>useful</i> studies; 
                                    but his mother advised him to attempt little, and engage but for few, that he might be more likely to keep to his intentions&#x201D;. 
                                    Because the aim is self&#x2010;regulation of feeling, <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span>&#x02BC;s mother considers but one virtue to be paramount in the jostling of abilities: 
                                    candour, the want of which she expects &#x201C;&#x2018;never &#x005B;to&#x005D; reproach him&#x2019;&#x201D;, since a misleading expression of feeling deranges the aim. 
                                    The contrary example of frank expresion in the tale is the dishonest boy, <span class="persName-fictional-TOMME">Tom</span>, whose lying vies with his spontaneous emotion,

                                the <span class="title-book-ASPINASTRONOMY"><i>Familiar Treatise</i></span> eases the reader into a series of brief essays beginning broadly with &#x201C;Of the Celestial Bodies Generally&#x201D;. 
                                From there, the <span class="title-book-ASPINASTRONOMY"><i>Familiar Treatise</i></span> surveys topics familiar to young readers of the dialogues&#x2014;gravitation, the structure and movements of the solar system, the bodies forming the solar system&#x2014;but 
                                explained in greater detail and illustrated with diagrams. Only after this extensive preparation is the reader introduced to the constellations&#x2014;the topic used by the astronomical dialogues 
                                and even by <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span>&#x02BC;s primer to snare the young reader&#x02BC;s initial interest in astronomy. The best is saved for last, however, 
                                as this section is keyed to the kit&#x02BC;s accompanying constellation cards. Following an introductory chapter on the fixed stars, the constellations are described in the order and in the groups 
                                depicted on the cards, again borrowing from <span class="persName-AJ">Jamieson</span>&#x02BC;s text (in reduced form), by first summarizing each contellation&#x02BC;s boundaries, chief stars and their magnitudes, and other identifying features; 
                                and then by relating, in short form, its legendary &#x201C;fable&#x201D;. This plan was in turn copied 
                                by the American academic, <span class="persName-JGREEN">Jacob Green</span>, in <span class="title-book-GREEN ASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><i>Astronomical Recreations</i></span>, and with a similar audience in mind (although the dates of his and <span class="persName-JASPIN">Aspin</span>&#x02BC;s 
                                publications are so close that it is unclear who copied whom).</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">As a primer for study specifically of the constellations, <span class="persName-JASPIN">Aspin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-ASPINASTRONOMY"><i>A Familiar Treatise</i></span> 
                                differs from star atlases and even from other primers by limiting its scope to constellations viewable from <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>&#x2014;a feature 
                                rendering the book less likely to have served as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s source for &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/apparatuses/constellations_apparatus" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 
                                albeit opening a window onto the uniquely British amateur astronomer in the <span class="date-1800-1899">nineteenth century</span>. For example, the section on the constellations supplies two fold&#x2010;out maps, 
                                one a planar representation of the &#x201C;Northern Hemisphere&#x201D; (cribbed from <span class="persName-AJ">Jamieson</span>&#x02BC;s chart in the <span class="title-book-JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><i>Celestial Atlas</i></span>), 
                                piecing together all the sectional views with outlines of the mythical figures, as rendered on the cards making up <span class="name--URANIASMIRROR">&#x201C;Urania&#x02BC;s Mirror&#x201D;</span>; 
                                and the second a &#x201C;Chart of the Heavens from the Latitude of <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>&#x201D;, divided into the boundaries of the visible constellations, 
                                each of which is tinted with a distinct color for clarity and mapped with the constellation&#x02BC;s chief stars. 
                                The book presents no fold&#x2010;out chart of the southern hemisphere, however; and while providing a list of the southern constellations, 
                                the detailed descriptions of each constellation, like the cards constituting <span class="name--URANIASMIRROR">Urania&#x02BC;s Mirror</span>, 
                                include only those southern constellations that are partially visible at the latitude of <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>. 
                                In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span>, the first two southern constellations that are listed in the poem (in its original version), 
                                the <span class="name--CRUX">Southern Cross</span> and <span class="name--CHARLESSOAK">Charles&#x02BC;s Oak</span>, are never visible from <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> and therefore omitted from representation or discussion 
                                in <span class="title-book-ASPINASTRONOMY"><i>A Familiar Treatise</i></span> and <span class="name--URANIASMIRROR">Urania&#x02BC;s Mirror</span> except for their names in the plenary list of southern constellations.

                                a memorization drill, which lists constellation names like <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span>&#x02BC;s exercise, but which is thoroughly secular, with no <span class="title-scripture-KJV">Bible</span> verses attached. 
                                The drill also suggests, however, that he consulted either a star atlas or a primer like <span class="persName-JASPIN">Aspin</span>&#x02BC;s derived from an atlas, since <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> is ordered 
                                to &#x201C;learn the following constellations with the number of stars&#x201D; belonging to each formation. 
                                There follow at intervals in the narrative columns of ten to twelve constellation names in English with their respective total number of stars, 
                                which <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> memorizes each morning

As 
                            remarked previously, the random order in which he names constellations in his poem suggests that he failed to master even the most basic astronomical concepts,  
                            as presented in <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span>&#x02BC;s elementary primer. Nonetheless, the atlas would have appealed not only in its visual depictions and prose summaries of myths; 
                            it would also have bolstered <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s pride in British achievements in astronomical discovery and science. A consistent theme in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poem is his observance of constellations with British associations, such as

                            Plates and globes depicted the mythical figures for which the constellations were named; and plates were found in star atlases, 
                            which among other information related the stories associated with the stars and constellations, 
                            such as the myth of the <span class="name--MILKYWAY">Milky Way (Via Lactea)</span> that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> uses to frame his conclusion to the second fair copy (<span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>):
