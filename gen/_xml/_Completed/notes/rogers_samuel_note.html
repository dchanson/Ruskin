                    <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> was admired for other poetry, as well, especially his <span class="date-1792">1792</span> poem, <span class="title-poem-ROGERSPLEASURES"><i>The Pleasures of Memory</i></span>. 
                    He was also famous as a conversationalist and as a patron of artists and other writers. 
                    A wealthy and successful businessman—he made his fortune in banking—he could afford to craft his polite, formal verse slowly and methodically, 
                    and to promote the classical aesthetic and collecting to which he was fervently devoted. He was a Regency “man of taste” 
                    who survived into an increasingly earnest generation.</div>

                    where he hosted gatherings of artists and writers at his famous breakfasts and dinners, was a palace of art. The rooms were neoclassical in design; and like

                        and some interior features of <span class="placeName-building-STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</span> were copied directly from <span class="persName-THA">Hope</span>ʼs <span class="placeName-DUCHESSST">Duchess Street</span> house,

                  <div class="p">The collection inside <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs museum‐like residence ranged from Greek and Roman antiquities, to Old Masters, 
                    to eighteenth‐ and nineteenth‐century British art, to curious objects of virtu. The library was significant for manuscripts, prints, and drawings, 
                    including the complete drawings by <span class="persName-JFSCULPTOR">John Flaxman</span> (<span class="date-1755-1826">1755‐1826</span>) after 
                    <span class="persName-AEG">Aeschylus</span>, and the largest collection in the kingdom of drawings by

                    was a major patron. In his acquisition of paintings and sculpture, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> oversaw a small but representative collection that, 
                    as <span class="persName-ABJ">Anna Jameson</span> (<span class="date-1794-1860">1794–1860</span>) commented, would serve better to educate a neophyte 
                    in the “true comprehension of the characteristic excellences of various painters” than would a larger and more imposing collection. Old Master paintings included works by 
                    Italian primitive and Renaissance (especially Venetian) artists; Baroque Flemish and Dutch artists; and landscapists, both classical <span class="placeName-fictional-ARCADIA">Arcadian</span> (e.g., <span class="persName-CLAUDE">Claude</span> 
                    and <span class="persName-NP">Poussin</span>) and Dutch. In British art, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs taste in figure and genre painting inclined to the modern 
                    with pieces by <span class="persName-RPB">Bonington</span>, <span class="persName-JHF">Fuseli</span>, <span class="persName-BRH">Haydon</span>,

                    <span class="persName-DWC">Wilkie</span>; and in landscape, his preference leaned to the classical and Dutch‐inspired with examples by <span class="persName-TG">Gainsborough</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span>, <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>, and <span class="persName-RWP">Wilson</span>. 
                    In <span class="date-1835">1835</span>, closer to the time when the young <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was first introduced to <span class="placeName-building-STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</span>,

                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-TSP">Thomas Stothard</span> was particularly important to <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs collecting and decorating, 
                    supplying not only works for the drawing and painting collections, but also illustrations for <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs own books, 
                    and even objects of interior design. A cabinet painted by him depicted characters from <span class="persName-WSP">Shakespeare</span>, <span class="persName-GCP">Chaucer</span>, 
                    and <span class="persName-GBP">Boccaccio</span>, likely designed in the rococo, <span class="persName-JAW">Watteauesque</span> style 
                    that <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span> had favored from his earliest book illustration commissions, and that he termed his <i>sans souci</i> manner

                    <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>ʼs working relationship with <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> was established as early as <span class="date-1794">1794</span>, 
                    when the artist supplied a few cuts for an edition of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSPLEASURES"><i>The Pleasures of Memory</i></span>, followed by much more profusely illustrated editions of this 
                    and other poems, many of these editions published by the firm of Thomas Cadell

                    The artist and patron shared political sympathies, <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span> having been apprenticed in his youth to <span class="placeName-SPITALSFIELD">Spitalsfield</span> radicals and, 
                    as a young artist, formed close friendships with <span class="persName-JFSCULPTOR">John Flaxman</span> and <span class="persName-WBP">William Blake</span> (<span class="date-1757-1827">1757‐1827</span>)

                    <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs associations included some of these artists, as well as influential Whig politicians

                    is accurate about the story of the boyʼs first encounter with <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>.

                        whether he received the book for his <span class="date-1832">1832</span> or <span class="date-1833">1833</span> birthday. Even more surprisingly, 
                        as <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>ʼs accounts show, a copy of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> 
                        was purchased only following the the familyʼs return from the <a href="/notes/tour_of_1833_note" target="_self">Tour of 1833</a>,
                        rather than prior to their departure (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 1:286 n. 1; and see

                        This may have been an additional copy, however. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs birthday copy is said to have been a present from

                    Perhaps <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> gained <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs entrée on the strength of the youthʼs remarkable imitation 
                    of the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> edition of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>,

                    <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> knew about <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs project, since he debuted the young poet in the annual,

                    by publishing a version of poems drawn from the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>. In that debut poem,

                    the combination of variety of color with symmetrical constraint might be credited to the influence of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs taste; 
                    and in the larger <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> project, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was certainly indebted

                    Basing its substance on his Continental tour of <span class="date-1814-1815">1814–15</span>, he started composition in <span class="date-1818">1818</span>.

                    These constant revisions and reissues can be explained as the consequence of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs perfectionism, which he was able to gratify by means of his enormous wealth, 
                    and not necessarily as his response to the indifferent reception of the poem, as has sometimes been alleged. While <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> had the bad luck (or reckless daring) to begin composing a long verse work about <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> just at the time when 
                    <span class="persName-GGB">Lord Byron</span> wrote and published the fourth canto of <span class="title-poem-BYRONPILGRIMAGE"><i>Childe Haroldʼs Pilgrimage</i></span> (<span class="date-1818">1818</span>),

                    <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs poem did sell respectably. <span class="persName-CP">Cecilia Powell</span> has found a figure of 1,250 copies sold by <span class="date-1823-04">April 1823</span>, according to a ledger of that date in the John Murray archive;

                    The Ruskin family numbered among the exceptional, albeit not exclusive, owners of these earlier editions of the poem, having puchased a copy in 
                    <span class="date-1828">1828</span>—presumably of the second part of the poem, issued in that year

                    <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs decision was a gamble, but an ingenious one that responded to rapid changes in the literary market that favored illustrated books.

                    because he was dismayed by the workʼs tepid reception, reviewers having largely treated it coolly or ignored it altogether, 
                    or because he was eager to publish a new, combined and revised version of parts 1 and 2—an extravagant approach to revision that was within his means—his 
                    decision cannot have been unaffected by the precipitous change in conditions that had favored publication of poetry prior to the <span class="date-1826-1829">later 1820s</span>. 
                    As <span class="persName-LE">Lee Erickson</span> has argued, in the first two decades of the century, the prestige of British poetry as a genre was supported by an economy of papermaking that 
                    kept the price of books high, thus encouraging consumers to favor a genre that repaid repeated reading of shorter works. Correspondingly, poets advanced a poetics 
                    that singled out an audience of the fit though few. This economy changed abruptly with industrial improvements that cheapened paper as well as making mass print runs possible through stereotyping. 
                    Now publishers encouraged a variety of genres, especially prose genres, in order to appeal to an audience expanding in both numbers and breadth of social class 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#ERICKSONECONOMY" target="_self"><span class="persName-LE">Erickson</span>, <span class="title-book-ERICKSONECONOMY"><i>Economy of Literary Form</i></span></a>, 19–48). 
                    <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>, for all his refinement, elitism, and perfectionism—indeed, in a certain respect by virtue of those traits—was able 
                    to maintain the viability of his poem, <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, by responding to the growing popular market 
                    as an entrepreneur. He did so by capitalizing on another technological innovation of the period, steel engraving, which made possible the mass production of the engraved image, 
                    and which in <span class="persName-LE">Erickson</span>ʼs view deflected what remained of the popular poetry market into the minor subgenre of light lyric and pictorial verse favored by the 
                    <a href="/notes/annuals_note" target="_self">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</a> 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#ERICKSONECONOMY" target="_self"><span class="persName-LE">Erickson</span>, <span class="title-book-ERICKSONECONOMY"><i>Economy of Literary Form</i></span></a>, 29–31). The medium 
                    made possible two of the most widely distributed and steadily demanded illustrated books of the first half of the century, both by <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>, the 
                    <span class="date-1830">1830</span> illustrated edition of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, and the 
                    <span class="date-1834">1834</span> collected <span class="title-book-ROGERSPOEMS1834"><i>Poems</i></span>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">The design element around which <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> organized these illustrated volumes was the engraved vignette, a feature that caught <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs eye 
                            when he came to imitate the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> illustrated <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> in compiling his own handmade illustrated travelogue, 
                            <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</span></a>. 
                            The vignette contributed to the appearance of an elite consumer item, while <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs investment put the volumes within reach of the middle class. 
                            Previously, however, the vignette had already accompanied a version of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, which was published in the most ephemeral of print venues, the <i>pocket book</i>. 
                    In <span class="date-1824-10-1824-11">late 1824</span>, there appeared a version of part 1 of the poem, with twelve copper engravings by <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>, 
                    published as the <span class="title-manual_guide-ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS"><i>Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</i></span> for <span class="date-1825">1825</span>  
                    (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#POWELLTURNERSVIGNETTES" target="_self"><span class="persName-CP">Powell</span>, <span class="title-essay-POWELLTURNERSVIGNETTES">“Turnerʼs Vignettes”</span></a>, 2; and

                    This was not an edition of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs complete poem, but an adaptation accommodated to the pocket book, 
                    which combined features of an annual almanac with the function of a diary or engagement calendar. The 
                    <span class="title-manual_guide-ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS"><i>Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</i></span> was an up‐market example of this kind 
                    of publication, with the almanac material refined to focus on fashionable information such as tables of the members of the British royalty and other dignitaries. 
                    The role played by <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs poem was to embellish the blank diary pages with brief verse extracts, 
                    illustrated by copper‐engraved vignettes by <span class="persName-TSP">Thomas Stothard</span>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p"><span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span> had been employed to illustrate the <span class="title-manual_guide-ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS"><i>Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</i></span> 
                    since <span class="date-1783">1783</span>, prior to his first cuts for <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs <span class="title-poem-ROGERSPLEASURES"><i>Pleasures of Memory</i></span>. 
                    The artist drew on that poem to illustrate the pocket book for <span class="date-1808">1808</span>, and on <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs 
                    <span class="title-poem-ROGERSHUMANLIFE"><i>Human Life</i></span> for the <span class="date-1820">1820</span> issue

                    The publisher, Thomas Baker of <span class="placeName-SOUTHAMPTON">Southampton</span>, appears to have relied on <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span> 
                    to impart the qualities that made this pocket book stand out in the market and maintain unusual longevity—the thematizing of each annual issue around a work 
                    of popular British literature, sometimes classic, but most often modern. The literary illustrations were limited to twelve vignettes, each less than one by two inches, 
                    and each one heading the first of a two‐page spread of diary pages for a given month. Quotations from the literary work were limited to brief captions, 
                    effectively forming part of the vignette itself. Working within these limitations, <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span> pictorially serialized such hefty works 
                    as novels and long narrative poems by <span class="persName-OG">Goldsmith</span>, <span class="persName-WCP">Cowper</span>, <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-GCRABBE">Crabbe</span>, <span class="persName-TCAMPBELL">Campbell</span>, and <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>

                    Evidence is unclear about what part, if any, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> himself played in the adaptation of 
                    <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> and his other poems to this ephemeral form of print culture.

                     <div class="p">Production of pocket books converged with the rise of the annuals, suggesting how popular print culture in itself helped stage the success 
                    of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs illustrated poems in the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. 
                    Fashionable pocket books flourished from the <span class="date-1770-1799">final three decades of the eighteenth century</span> through the

                    which emerged in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>, shared features of the pocket books such as almanac tables. 
                    <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> probably commenced designing vignettes for the book‐length illustrated 
                    <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> as early as <span class="date-1826">1826</span>, 
                    only one year after the appearance of the pocket‐book version of the poem with its small vignettes by <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>

                    of this long‐running pocket book, presents two significant differences compared to earlier issues, which suggest a greater authorial presence: 
                    <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span> substituted architectural scenes for his usual figure illustrations, a subject more like <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>ʼs; 
                    and <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs text was placed more on a par with the illustrations, rather than serving merely as a prompt for the pictures. 
                    Whereas earlier layouts reduced the literary source to a series of brief captions to the pictures, the <span class="date-1825">1825</span> issue 
                    presented a facing‐page spread, with the verso embellished by an architectural vignette, and the facing recto (formerly blank, in earlier issues) presenting a text box 
                    containing a substantial verse extract, as compared with the mere captions incorporated into the illustrations for earlier issues

                  <div class="p">While capitalizing on recent print technologies, and influenced by a changing economy for poetry, the innovations marking <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs 
                    <span class="date-1830">1830</span> <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> also preserved some old‐fashioned 
                    elements of neoclassical design that suited the authorʼs taste and over which he exerted complete control. In the bookʼs design, as <span class="persName-JPSCHOLAR">Jan Piggott</span> suggests, 
                    <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs model was the page layout of vignette and text as found in  
                    <a href="/notes/bibliography#GOLDSMITHPARNELLPOEMS" target="_self"><span class="title-book-GOLDSMITHPARNELLPOEMS"><i>Poems by Goldsmith and Parnell</i></span></a>, 
                    published by <span class="persName-WBPUBLISHER">William Bulmer</span> (ca. <span class="date-1757-1830">1757–1830</span>) at his Shakspeare Printing Office in <span class="date-1795">1795</span>

                    In that edition, poems were decorated with headpiece and tailpiece engravings by <span class="persName-TBENGRAVER">Thomas Bewick</span> 
                    (<span class="date-1753-1828">1753–1828</span>) and <span class="persName-JBE">John Bewick</span> (ca. <span class="date-1760-1795">1760–95</span>). 
                    In <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, the headpieces typically feature <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>ʼs landscapes, 
                    while the tailpieces illustrate narrative episodes with <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>ʼs figures. The effect could not be achieved using older technologies 
                    employed by the Bewicks, however, since they engraved in wood, producing relief blocks that could be set along with the type, whereas steel engraving was an intaglio process. 
                    To achieve the neoclassical design using updated technology, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs printers devised a method for passing sheets through the press twice, 
                    once for caputuring the intaglio engraving, and once again for taking impressions from the relief type. The intaglio impression was taken first, 
                    and in such a way that the plate registration mark would be cut away with the trimmed pages

                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> exercised authoritarian control over the design and execution of every illustration, just as he obsessively revised almost every poem 
                    for the new edition (and persisted in developing <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> and other works for future editions of his poetry). 
                    <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> decided on the subjects of the illustrations and their treatment, and he demanded subtle alterations in their execution, 
                    even if the laborious steel engraving was already underway. The artists and engravers were compliant, with <span class="persName-">Turner</span> relinquishing his instinct for drama 
                    in favor of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs neoclassicism, and allowing <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>ʼs figures to be placed in his landscapes, 
                    while the less temperamental <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span> remained ready to agree to almost anything 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#BENNETTSTOTHARD" target="_self"><span class="persName-SMBENNETT">Bennett</span>, <span class="title-book-BENNETTSTOTHARD"><i>Thomas Stothard</i></span></a>, 26–29;

                    Even the printer probably did not escape <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs supervision, who was known to descend on printshops and stir 
                    “up everybody with a long stick” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MERRIAMMOXON" target="_self"><span class="persName-HGMERRIAM">Merriam</span>, <span class="title-book-MERRIAMMOXOM"><i>Edward Moxon</i></span></a>, 28 n. 15). 
                    As critics have remarked, however, if <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> was exacting in his demands, he and his collaborators were sympathetically well matched in their approach to the subject. 
                    <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>ʼs cheery representation of childhood and his idealized view of feminine grace clearly appealed to <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs taste 
                    as a collector and a writer (<a href="/notes/bibliography#BENNETTSTOTHARD" target="_self"><span class="persName-SMBENNETT">Bennett</span>, <span class="title-book-BENNETTSTOTHARD"><i>Thomas Stothard</i></span></a>, 31–35); 
                    and <span class="persName-">Turner</span>, while sharing <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs reverence for the antiquity of <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>, 
                    shrewdly offset his patronʼs tendency to mire his poetry in historical pedantry, and instead complemented the poems with topographical interest that the poet neglected

                  <div class="p">The result is a happy collaboration of writer and artists that both embodies the technological advances and the changing literary markets of the <span class="date-1820-1839">1820s–30s</span>, 
                    while also defying the odds presented by those markets with an outstanding success. The <span class="date-1830">1830</span> <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> 
                    seems to pass judgment on the technologies that it exploits, as compared with the gaudy shallowness of the bookʼs cousins, the steel‐engraved 
                    <a href="/notes/annuals_note" target="_self">annuals</a>. Its typography referenced the beautiful typeface used for the 
                    Shakspeare Press edition of <span class="persName-OG">Goldsmith</span>ʼs and <span class="persName-TPPOET">Parnell</span>ʼs poems, 
                    a face designed for <span class="persName-WBPUBLISHER">Bulmer</span> by <span class="persName-WMTP">William Martin</span> (<span class="date-1815">d. 1815</span>). 
                    Its engraving, worthy of the Bewicksʼ skill, was undertaken by <a href="/notes/goodall_edward_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-">Edward Goodall</span> (<span class="date-1795-1870">1795–1870</span>)</a>, 
                    who managed to reproduce <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>ʼs exquisitely delicate atmospheric effects in spite of the hard, stubborn, and unforgiving medium of steel. 
                    In <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, the success was repeated with a collected edition of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs 
                    <a href="/notes/bibliography#ROGERSPOEMS1834" target="_self"><i>Poems</i></a>, likewise jointly issued by the firms of 
                    Cadell and Moxon, and illustrated by additional engraved vignettes 
                    after <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> and <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>. Sadly, <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span> 
                    died in the year of publication, after lingering for several months incapacitated by the effects of an accident.</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">By <span class="date-1847">1847</span>, shortly before revolutions on the Continent must have made <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs Grand Tour poem seem quaintly dated,

                    <span class="date-1834">1834</span> <span class="title-book-ROGERSPOEMS1834"><i>Poems</i></span>, is estimated to have reached 50,000 copies

                    According to <span class="persName-JRH">J. R. Hale</span>, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> considered the <span class="date-1834">1834</span> edition 
                    of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> to be the “first complete” version of the work

                    however, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> appears to have continued to oversee editions of his poems, adding notes and possibly making further small refinements to the poems.

                    In a two‐volume edition of the paired works held by the library of the University of California, Los Angeles, the volume of 
                    <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> carries a title page with the date <span class="date-1835">1835</span>. 
                    Its contents appears identical to that of the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> edition, whatever variants might be discoverable in the individual poems and prose pieces.) 
                    In <span class="date-1839">1839</span>, a new illustrated edition of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> appeared—whether 
                    on the initiative of the author, or the publisher Moxon, or both—which used woodcuts based on earlier designs by <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>, 
                    as well as new designs by <span class="persName-AWC">A. W. Callcott</span> (<span class="date-1779-1844">1779–1844</span>),
