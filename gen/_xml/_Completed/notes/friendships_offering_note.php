                                <span class="persName-LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</span>&#x02BC;s preface seems bent on covering all bases for the possible marketability of his attempt at this miscellaneous venue&#x2014;to compete with Continental models (chiefly German) 
                                of the literary annual by translating the form to meet British taste; to supply the holiday gift market; to furnish (&#x201C;independently&#x201D;) both &#x201C;graphic decorations&#x201D; and &#x201C;original contributions . . . from popular pens&#x201D;;

                                and a purpose not mentioned directly by the competitors, to seize on the British pent&#x2010;up, post&#x2010;Napoleonic desire for travel, actual or virtual, by pairing engraved &#x201C;views&#x201D; of foreign cities with descriptions based on &#x201C;personal observation&#x201D;

                                attempting an appreciative critical history of the annuals when they had declined in popularity, <span class="persName-LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</span>&#x02BC;s early volumes 
                                were criticized for their weak contents and poor production and also their haphazard miscellaneity&#x2014;&#x201C;unpromising&#x201D; assemblages of &#x201C;indifferent views of Continental cities&#x201D;, &#x201C;poor verses&#x201D;,

                                The writer particularly dwelled on the inclusion of &#x201C;ruled pages for memoranda&#x201D;, as typically found in a pocket&#x2010;book, as the proof of unconsidered paste&#x2010;up, 
                                a feature that the writer condemned likewise in the <span class="title-annual-FRIENSHIPSOFFERING">Offering</span>&#x02BC;s early rivals, <span class="title-annual-FORGETMENOT"><i>Forget Me Not</i></span> and <span class="title-annual-GRACES"><i>The Graces</i></span>

                                In the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>, however, reviews of Relfe&#x02BC;s early volumes suggest that critics embraced the miscellany.

                                and flowers of literature with the utility of the superior class of pocket&#x2010;books, and in this . . .  he has in a great degree succeeded&#x201D;&#x2014;adding parenthetically, not that <span class="persName-LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</span> should have aimed at greater uniformity of purpose, 
                                but that he might have made up for &#x201C;the deficiency of an almanack&#x201D;, although admittedly that addition &#x201C;would have necessarily much increased the price&#x201D;

                                by the editorship of <span class="persName-TKH">T. K. Hervey</span> (<span class="date-1799-1859">1799&#x2013;1859</span>). In his prefatory remarks for Relfe&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1826">1826</span> volume, <span class="persName-TKH">Hervey</span> announced &#x201C;a view to an entire change in . . . &#x005B;the annual&#x02BC;s&#x005D; character and plan&#x201D;, 
                                by shifting emphasis from the transience of an annual to the permanence of a keepsake: the &#x201C;alterations&#x201D; were to &#x201C;consist in the removal of all those features which marked it as more peculiarly adapted for one season of the year than another&#x201D;. 
                                Starting with that volume, the almanac and pocket&#x2010;book features were suppressed, and the subtitle shortened to &#x201C;A Literary Album&#x201D; to signal the concentrated focus. 
                                What had happened was not solely <span class="persName-TKH">Hervey</span>&#x02BC;s inspiration, however, but a broader trend reflected in a <span class="title-periodical-MONTHLYREVIEW"><i>Monthly Review</i></span> article 
                                published one year earlier, which is clearly the source of <span class="persName-TKH">Hervey</span>&#x02BC;s announcement of changes being made in <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>. The article presents a brief critical history of the British annual, 
                                celebrating the &#x201C;keen and enterprising spirit of emulation&#x201D; that has enabled &#x201C;our countrymen&#x201D; in a short time to have so improved on the German Taschenbuch that &#x201C;the least elegant of . . . &#x005B;the British annuals&#x005D; is greatly superior to any thing produced on the Continent&#x201D;. 
                                The key to this progress, according to the article, lay in a marker that carried a rebuke to the proprietor of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Frienship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>:</div>

In <span class="date-1825">1825</span>, probably only one annual represented the pinnacle of achievement&#x2014;the <span class="title-annual-LITERARYSOUVENIR"><i>Literary Souvenir</i></span>, 
                                edited by <span class="persName-AWEDITOR">Alaric Watts</span>, the sole publication under review in this <span class="title-periodical-MONTHLYREVIEW"><i>Monthly Review</i></span> article. Although only first published in <span class="date-1825">1825</span>, the <span class="title-annual-LITERARYSOUVENIR"><i>Literary Souvenir</i></span> already benefitted 
                                from a nationalistic evolutionary narrative. (The narrative gained credence from the decision of the <span class="title-annual-LITERARYSOUVENIR"><i>Souvenir&#x02BC;s</i></span> publisher, <span class="persName-RH">Hurst, Robinson</span>, to make way for funding the <span class="title-annual-LITERARYSOUVENIR"><i>Literary Souvenir</i></span> 
                                by discontinuing an existing annual, <span class="title-annual-GRACES"><i>The Graces</i></span>, after publishing only one volume. Although the exchange was friendly, <span class="title-annual-GRACES"><i>The Graces</i></span>, which was born the same year as <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>, 
                                ironically contributed to the evolutionary narrative by claiming British superiority over Continental models for having disburdened itself of the their &#x201C;loaded . . . weight&#x201D; of almanac features, 
                                but then set itself &#x201C;to embrace . . . every topic of accomplishment, elegance, and polite information, that can interest the general reader&#x201D;, 
                                including a decorated diary for the user&#x02BC;s memoranda, which it imitated from <span class="title-annual-FORGETMENOT"><i>Forget Me Not</i></span>

                                One or both volumes included poet/churchmen such as the <span class="persName-TDREV">Reverend Thomas Dale</span> (<span class="date-1797-1870">1797&#x2013;1870</span>), <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s future <span class="placeName-CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</span> schoolmaster, and

                                who supplied mainly verse, but who could also be relied on for a variety of commissions: <span class="persName-BB">Bernard Barton</span> (<span class="date-1784-1849">1784&#x2013;1849</span>), <span class="persName-JCLARE">John Clare</span> (<span class="date-1793-1864">1793&#x2013;1864</span>),

                                Relief from the sentiments of such verse came from humorists like <span class="persName-JG">John Galt</span> (<span class="date-1779-1839">1779&#x2013;1839</span>), <span class="persName-THOOD">Thomas Hood</span> (<span class="date-1799-1845">1799&#x2013;1845</span>), and <span class="persName-HS">Horace Smith</span> (<span class="date-1779-1849">1779&#x2013;1849</span>). 
                                The contributors represented cultures of <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>, <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>, <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span>, and <span class="placeName-IRELAND">Ireland</span>, 
                                as well as lived experience from abroad. Some pieces were written in dialect. They represented a variety of religious and ideological stances, 
                                though never so aggressively as to perturb the unifying script of friendship, sentiment, and memory. 
                            Many contributors labored as editors of competing annuals, magazines, and newspapers, including <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s future personal editor,

                                Fairly or not, reviewers turned to the <span class="title-annual-LITERARYSOUVENIR"><i>Literary Souvenir</i></span> as the standard for taste and execution in illustration, 
                                whereas <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span> was at least typical of the period in highlighting the shared &#x201C;poetry&#x201D; of the Sister Arts 
                                (see <a href="#POETRYOFSISTERARTS">Illustration: The Poetry of the Sister Arts in the Relfe Annual</a>); 
                                and at least one of Relfe&#x02BC;s volumes contained a unique venture, a <span class="date-1826">1826</span> sampling of contemporary French art

                        but with the acquisition of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span> the company made a bid for an expanded share of the burgeoning illustrated book market. 
                        Under their custodianship, <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span> achieved a steady measure of distinction in the growing field of annuals. 
                            The takeover was made most immediately apparent to the public by an innovative embossed leather binding, which included the publisher&#x02BC;s name along with the annual&#x02BC;s title integrated into the cover design and stamped sharply into the material. 
                            (see <a href="#SMITHELDERBINDING">Binding</a>). As part of the deal, Smith, Elder 
                            must have acquired Relfe&#x02BC;s backstock, since an advertisement offered &#x201C;sets of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>,

                            Sales rose, eventually peaking at ten thousand copies per year, helping to assure the fortunes of Smith, Elder as a publisher.

                            In his autobiography, <span class="persName-CK">Knight</span> describes his role in the transition between publishers as hectic: 
                            &#x201C;It was an enterprise hastily entered upon by Messrs. Smith and Elder, late in the season, 
                            and I had to obtain pictures for engraving, secure contributors, and see the book through the press in two or three months&#x201D;. 
                            He credits the success of the ordeal to friends who &#x201C;rallied round&#x201D; with contributions that he considered 
                            more &#x201C;original&#x201D; than the &#x201C;sentimental stories&#x201D; and &#x201C;mawkish&#x201D; verses &#x201C;with their bowers and flowers&#x201D; typical of the annuals

                            and he held the annuals generally in low regard&#x2014;all too characteristic, he believed, of &#x201C;a period in which . . . mediocrity was essentially necessary to great literary success&#x201D;

                                In a review of the annuals for <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, a writer for the <span class="title-periodical-LONDONMAGAZINE"><i>London Magazine</i></span>, who despaired of the annuals ever amassing a pool of genuine talent, 
                                proposed a model based on &#x201C;the Taschenbuchs of <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span>, which were sometimes got up by a few men of genius, who, 
                                at the end of the year, clubbed their <i>adversaria</i>, and published together a little miscellaneous volume, 
                                which had or might not have some definite object. The hint might, we think, be adopted in this country with advantage&#x201D;. 
                                Alhough &#x201C;the time is gone by when men wrote in knots and schools&#x201D;, the writer considering even the Lake School a thing of the past in <span class="date-1826">1826</span>, 
                                he believed &#x201C;&#x005B;t&#x005D;here are . . . many clubs or schools even at present existing, which might throw together an occasional periodical of this kind with effect, 
                                whether the object be grave or gay&#x2014;pleasure or improvement&#x201D;. The echoes of this proposal with <span class="persName-CK">Knight</span>&#x02BC;s experience of publishing the <span class="title-periodical-ETONIAN"><i>Etonian</i></span> are striking

                                    He returned to <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span> with disappointed hopes, but with exotic experience to be made into poetry as well as a passion for the abolitionist cause. 
                                    It was doubtless his earlier literary connections in <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span>, however, with figures no less auspicious than <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>,

                                    and from <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span> to the empire, and here the presumed Englishness of that unifying standard of taste is made explicit

                                    Reviewers might complain about the overall blandness and uniformity of the annuals, especially as the market grew increasingly competitive with new titles added each year, but at the same time the market tended toward uniformity.

                    For the <span class="title-periodical-MONTHLYREVIEW"><i>Monthly Review</i></span>, critical scrutiny of the annuals&#x02BC; literary merit was a sometimes painful duty, 
                    since &#x201C;fugitive and trifling . . . in some instances&#x201D; as the pieces were, the poetry and prose were worth &#x201C;the attention of a journal which professes to watch the intellect of the country&#x201D;;. 
                    It was the annuals&#x02BC; pictorial content, however, that placed the annuals in &#x201C;a class by themselves, which enables us to judge . . . of the progress made amongst us, not only in literary composition, but in the arts&#x201D;

                    <span class="title-periodical-LONDONMAGAZINE"><i>The London Magazine</i></span> went further, having been &#x201C;grievously disappointed&#x201D; in the annuals considered &#x201C;as the united labours of the chief persons distinguished in this country for literature and poetry&#x201D;, 
                    but &#x201C;looking at the prose and verse merely as the letter&#x2010;press of engravings, it assumes a different character&#x201D;

                  <div class="p">In <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>, from Relfe&#x02BC;s volumes to Smith, Elder&#x02BC;s, the number of &#x201C;embellishments&#x201D; per volume remained twelve or thirteen, including the frontispiece and presentation plate, 
                            which form part of the frontmatter. (A <i>presentation plate</i> is an engraved title page with a blank cartouche, in which the giver or owner could 
                    inscribe a name or brief message.) Although some annuals competed by offering more embellishments, a dozen or so was likewise typical of other annuals, 
                    the number perhaps limited by the time and expense required to commission or borrow art, and arrange for the lengthy process of steel reproduction&#x2014;processes that must have grown more competitive as new titles entered the market each year. 
                    As <span class="persName-AWEDITOR">Alaric Watts</span> pointed out to consumers of the <span class="title-annual-LITERARYSOUVENIR"><i>Literary Souvenir</i></span>, &#x201C;if, instead of such illustrations as these &#x005B;ten in number, assembled for the <span class="date-1826">1826</span> volume&#x005D;, from original paintings and drawings, most of which have been procured with very great expense, 
                    I had chosen to introduce inferior plates, perhaps pleasing enough to persons possessing no great refinement of taste, taken from published prints, or obtained from cheap sources, 
                    more than double the number might have been given, at precisely the same cost&#x201D;. However, in order to keep the price at the competitive twelve shillings per copy, he was obliged to balance the costs of original artwork 
                    and engraving against the large&#x2010;volume sales required to make a profit (<a href="/notes/bibliography#LITERARYSOUVENIR1826" target="_self"><span class="persName-AWEDITOR">Watts</span>, preface to <span class="title-annual-LITERARYSOUVENIR"><i>Literary Souvenir</i> &#x005B;<span class="date-1826">1826</span>&#x005D;</span></a>, viii). 
                    According to one estimate of costs entailed in producing all the annuals for <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, the total expenditures on commissions and fees to artists and engravers more than doubled the payments to writers, 
                    despite the disparity in numbers of contributions&#x2014;in any given annual, perhaps nearly a hundred pieces of writing compared to a dozen plates (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#ONSLOWGENDEREDPRODUCTION" target="_self"><span class="persName-BONSLOW">Onslow</span>, <span class="title-essay-ONSLOWGENDEREDPRODUCTION">&#x201C;Gendered Production: Annuals and Gift Books&#x201D;</span></a>, 74).</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">The number of plates contained in a given volume does not appear to have been constrained by practical considerations of binding, such as limiting insertion to the gaps between signatures. 
                    Placement was governed by content: a plate could be inserted facing the first page of a poem describing it, or adjacent to a page in the middle of a tale that contained a climactic event depicted in the engraving

                        <span class="date-1700-1799">Eighteenth&#x2010;century</span> pictorialism might recur in some poems and in tales, picking out details in their accompanying plates as a strategy for binding the picture to a descriptive poem or a tale&#x02BC;s action

                        but more typical is the keynote of pervasive emotion struck by the opening poem of Smith, Elder&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1829">1829</span> volume: &#x201C;Two lovely Sisters here unite&#x201D; so that

The subject was germane to an ekphrastic miscellany like an annual, 
                        since <span class="persName-RSU">Raphael</span> had come to regarded as embodying the art of painting itself. For the French academic artworld, however, <span class="persName-RSU">Raphael</span> stood for the art of painting as a 
                        &#x201C;symbolic embodiment of French artistic ideals&#x201D;. He was a &#x201C;&#x2018;modern <span class="persName-APELLES">Apelles</span>&#x2019;&#x201D; answering to &#x201C;that complete perfection&#x201D; of art 
                        believed to be &#x201C;shown in ancient times by the figures of <span class="persName-APELLES">Apelles</span> and <span class="persName-ZEUXIS">Zeuxis</span>&#x201D;. No less was said of <span class="persName-RSU">Raphael</span> in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>&#x02BC;s Royal Academy, 
                        but during the French Empire, when <span class="persName-">Napoleon</span> had confiscated <span class="persName-RSU">Raphael</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-artwork-RAPHAELTRANSFIGURATION"><i>Transfiguration</i></span> from the <span class="placeName-VATICAN">Vatican</span>, 
                        the Raphaelesque aesthetic ideal also became politicized. <span class="persName-PNB">Bergeret</span>&#x02BC;s depiction of <span class="persName-RSU">Raphael</span>&#x02BC;s wake, attended by powerful nobles as <span class="persName-GV">Vasari</span> recounted, 
                        was meant to illustrate the premise that great men are glorified by their homage to great artists. If <span class="persName-RSU">Raphael</span> embodied the art of painting,

                        and brings it down to size for the annual. <span class="persName-RSU">Raphael</span>&#x02BC;s art is characterized as deathless, not because of the codependency of art with the power of the state,

                     <div class="p">Perhaps because genre subjects and topographical landscape were deemed more accessible to the poetic response expected of the annual&#x02BC;s reader, 
                        <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> in <span class="date-1826">1826</span></span> reflected the current tension between British and French aesthetics, the latter still favoring history painting and classical landscape. 
                        The influence of this debate over the annual&#x02BC;s art commissions may have been somewhat adventitious, but an outcome was the valume&#x02BC;s beautiful final plate,

                     <div class="p">Apparently the first work by this important artist to be published in a British annual, <span class="title-artwork-BONINGTONROUENFROMBONSECOURS"><i>Rouen</i></span> not only represents the advocacy of British picturesque style by rebellious Romantic French artists; 
                        the plate also signals the introduction of engraving on steel to <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>, as advertised in the plate&#x02BC;s caption. 
                        Thus, the annual advanced to the vanguard of a technological development, which had been introduced only in the previous year by Ackermann&#x02BC;s

                        edited by <span class="persName-AWEDITOR">Alaric Watts</span> (see 
                        <a href="/notes/annuals_note#STEELENGRAVING" target="_self">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books: Steel Engraving</a>). 
                        <span class="persName-AWEDITOR">Watts</span>&#x02BC;s volume presented a steel&#x2010;engraved view of the <span class="placeName-THAMES">Thames</span>

                        which, like <span class="persName-RPB">Bonington</span>&#x02BC;s view of the <span class="placeName-SEINE">Seine</span>, pictured a river prospect from a high vantage. 
                        The two pictures thus put on view the rivalry between the annuals, as well as reflecting the broader aspirations of the young French Romantic artists who, at just this time, 
                        were visiting <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> to study the modern British landscape school.</div>

                        received his training in the atelier of <span class="persName-AJG">Baron Antoine&#x2010;Jean Gros</span> (<span class="date-1771-1835">1771&#x2013;1835</span>). 
                        To a neoclassicist such as <span class="persName-AJG">Gros</span> and the influential artist and critic <span class="persName-EDELECLUZE">Étienne Del&#x00E9;cluze</span> (<span class="date-1781-1863">1781&#x2013;1863</span>), 
                        subjects that especially attracted <span class="persName-RPB">Bonington</span>&#x2014;such as the coastal scenery of <span class="placeName-NORMANDY">Normandy</span> 
                        and the Gothic architecture of <span class="placeName-ROUEN">Rouen</span>&#x2014;seemed random and meaningless, low on the scale of the traditional ordering of the Sister Arts. 
                        Students&#x02BC; understanding should be elevated by historical and religious subjects rather than by landscape&#x2014;much less by the localized, provincial scenes 
                        that characterized the British school, as opposed to the timeless classical landscapes of the French tradition. Yet, to the alarm of those who defended 
                        the tradition of <span class="persName-AJG">Gros</span>&#x02BC;s teacher, <span class="persName-JLD">Jacques&#x2010;Louis David</span> (<span class="date-1748-1825">1748&#x2013;1825</span>), 
                        British&#x2010;influenced picturesque subjects were gaining popularity in <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span>. French critics also rejected the loose style of the British school, 
                        such as the textured brushstrokes of oils by <span class="persName-CONSTABLEARTIST">John Constable</span>, and the tonal rather than linear definition of architectural drawing 
                        by <a href="/notes/prout_samuel_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-SP">Samuel Prout</span></a> and others of the &#x201C;Monro School&#x201D;.

                     <div class="p">Nonetheless, English style had recently gained impetus in <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span> from the success of <span class="persName-CONSTABLEARTIST">John Constable</span>,

                        Fired by enthusiasm for British landscape art and for the naturalistic approach it represented, <span class="persName-RPB">Bonington</span> visited <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> 
                        in <span class="date-1825">1825</span>, in the company of <span class="persName-AMC">Alexandre&#x2010;Marie Colin</span> (<span class="date-1798-1875">1798&#x2013;1875</span>),

                        For his contacts in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, <span class="persName-RPB">Bonington</span> relied on engravers, including the <a href="/notes/cooke_family_note" target="_self">Cooke family</a>, 
                        known for their reproduction of work by <span class="persName-JMWT">J. M. W. Turner</span>

                        Both poems composed respectively for the plates rely on Wordsworthian tropes of return and loss to prompt wistful responses to the scenes; however, the speaker of 
                        <span class="title-poem-ANONWRITTENATROUEN">&#x201C;Written at Rouen&#x201D;</span> is compelled to draw attention to the foreignness of the scene, while the speaker of <span class="title-poem-WATTSRICHMOND-HILL">&#x201C;Richmond&#x2010;Hill&#x201D;</span> exploits the homeliness of the familiar view at the expense of pretensions of foreign travelers.

                        of how the invidious commercialization of art through book illustration, and through such popular spectacles as the diorama, threatened a degeneration of the ideology propping up the traditional ordering of the arts. 
                        Even the volume&#x02BC;s single example approaching Davidian neoclassicism (softened by color and eroticism),

                        for the firm&#x02BC;s ambitious early publications in engraving and aquatint. According to an early biographer of the firm, <span class="persName-LHUXLEY">Leonard Huxley</span>, 
                        art reproduction was the special care of <span class="persName-AE">Alexander Elder</span> (<span class="date-1790-1876">1790&#x2013;1876</span>), who was interested in art

                        Presumably, <span class="persName-AE">Elder</span> would have been anxious to showcase the firm&#x02BC;s expertise in their selection and presentation of the new annual&#x02BC;s embellishments. 
                        The firm would also have needed to extend their expertise beyond engraving and aquatint to commission steel engraving, which had already been introduced under Relfe (see 
                        <a href="#RELFEFRENCHILLUSTRATI0N">Genre and Landscape Art in the Annual, and the Contest between the British Picturesque Aesthetic and French Neoclassicism</a>; and

                     <div class="p">As at least an appearance of shift in emphasis, Smith, Elder advertised that their debut volume would feature engravings taken from recently exhibited British paintings, 
                        including art &#x201C;painted expressly for the Work&#x201D;. The claim was not unprecented: <span class="persName-AWEDITOR">Alaric Watts</span> advertised that two engravings for the <span class="date-1826">1826</span> <span class="title-annual-LITERARYSOUVENIR1826"><i>Literary Souvenir</i></span> were based on originals 
                        &#x201C;made . . . expressly for this work&#x201D; by <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> and by <span class="persName-GSN">Gilbert Stuart Newton</span> (<span class="date-1795-1835">1795&#x2013;1835</span>) (<a href="/notes/bibliography#LITERARYSOUVENIR1826" target="_self">preface to <span class="title-annual-LITERARYSOUVENIR1826"><i>Literary Souvenir</i> &#x005B;<span class="date-1825">1826</span>&#x005D;</span></a>, vii). 
                        Albeit an exaggeration, the decision by Smith, Elder to feature pictures from recent <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> exhibitions 
                        spoke to the attention that reviewers gave to annuals as a measure of &#x201C;the intellect of the country&#x201D;. The same justification, it seems, lay behind the decision in the list of embellishments for <span class="date-1830">1830</span> volume to give equal weight 
                        to the designation &#x201C;in the collection of&#x201D; as to the tags &#x201C;made expressly for&#x201D; and &#x201C;as exhibited at&#x201D;&#x2014;the patronage of collectors standing also as a measure of the nation&#x02BC;s intellect and wealth. 
                        For consumers like the Ruskins, studying the plates with these designations would have raised their awareness of <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> exhibiting institutions and private collections.</div>

                     <div class="p">The success of Smith, Elder&#x02BC;s takeover of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span> 
                                hinged in part on an innovation in binding, which substituted embossed leather for the printed and glazed paper&#x2010;covered boards and slipcase that were initially characteristic of both this annual 
                                and <span class="title-annual-FORGETMENOT"><i>Forget Me Not</i></span>. On the evidence, however, of a well&#x2010;preserved copy of Relfe&#x02BC;s second volume, the <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1825"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span> for <span class="date-1825">1825</span>, 
                                which was acquired by Princeton University Library Special Collections in <span class="date-2010">2010</span>, one might adjust of narrative of Smith, Elder&#x02BC;s innovation to take account of 
                                how the new publisher developed the annual&#x02BC;s existing reputation for splendor rather than supplanting a drab commodity. While it has been known that <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>, like <span class="title-annual-FORGETMENOT"><i>Forget Me Not</i></span>, was sold pre&#x2010;packaged in printed and glazed paper boards and a slipcase, rather than a temporary binding to be replaced by the consumer (see 
                                <a href="/notes/annuals_note#BINDING" target="_self">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books: Bindings</a>), the Princeton copy reveals a slipcase cover 
                                with an elaborate Gothic Revival design in multiple colors, the gothic tracery forming a window or portal enclosing the title, which is lettered in a gothic and scrolled calligraphic style. 
                                The slipcase spine is cleverly printed with a vertical gothic pillar showing statues in niches, and the case retains an attached purple&#x2010;silk ribbon&#x2010;pull. This design corresponds stylistically to the volume&#x02BC;s title page, which is also Gothic Revival but a distinct design, not printed from the same plate used for the slipcase cover. 
                                The title page is likewise printed in multiple colors, and the design is a gothic arch framing the title and publisher&#x02BC;s imprint lettered in a calligraphic style 
                                (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#PRINCETONLIBRARYSPECIALCOLLECTIONSBLOG-2010-04-10" target="_self">&#x201C;&#x2018;<span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span> wears a most captivating appearance&#x2019;: <span class="date-1825">1825</span>&#x201D;</a>). 
                                As a visual artifact, Relfe&#x02BC;s annual presented a striking and luxurious appearance; and its brightly colored design, 
                                like the mechanized leather embossing that replaced it, originated in the tastes instilled by the Gothic Revival combined with innovative and cheapening industrial&#x2010;age printing and binding technologies 
                                (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#JAMIESONENGLISHEMBOSSEDBINDINGS" target="_self"><span class="persName-EJ">Jamieson</span>, <span class="title-book-"><i>English Embossed Bindings</i></span></a>, 1, 7&#x2013;31).</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">The boards of the Princeton copy likewise suggest that Smith, Elder was elaborating on, rather than eclipsing, the impression made by Relfe&#x02BC;s earlier binding. 
                                This example has a front board covered with a pale embossed paper, which is probably related to a lilac&#x2010;colored case made from embossed card that <span class="persName-EJ">Eleanore Jamieson</span> observed on an <span class="date-1827">1827</span> copy of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>, Relfe&#x02BC;s final volume. 
                                These embossed papers were produced in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> using a &#x201C;fly&#x2010;embossing&#x2010;press&#x201D;, a machine that exerted high pressure to stamp &#x201C;so sharp and detailed an impression over the whole cover&#x201D; 
                                that the covers had to be embossed separately from the book as case bindings, as opposed to &#x201C;blocked bindings&#x201D; that applied embossed patterns to the cover after the book was already bound

                                The embossed design is an arabesque surrounding the borders 
                                <a href="/notes/bibliography#PRINCETONLIBRARYSPECIALCOLLECTIONSBLOG-2010-04-10" target="_self">&#x201C;&#x2018;<span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span> wears a most captivating appearance&#x2019;: <span class="date-1825">1825&#x201D;</span></a>). 
                                Embossed covers in leather, produced by this powerful machine to stamp arabesque designs over the entire surface of the boards, were first produced around <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, simultaneously with its use for Smith, Elder&#x02BC;s debut volume of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>. 
                                The bindings for Smith, Elder were produced by <span class="persName-ABAIN">Alexander Bain</span>, whose name is stamped in tiny but precise lettering at the bottom&#x2010;center of the boards, beneath the more prominently lettered publisher&#x02BC;s name 
                                (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JAMIESONENGLISHEMBOSSEDBINDINGS" target="_self"><span class="persName-EJ">Jamieson</span>, <span class="title-book-"><i>English Embossed Bindings</i></span></a>, 10&#x2013;12, 17). 
                                There are correspondences between the Relfe arabesque design, which includes a lyre in the center&#x2010;top and center&#x2010;bottom borders, and the Smith, Elder cover, which also employs the lyre device, but causes it to stand out, 
                                blocked in gilt in the center of the full front cover. Thus, again, a comparison of the Relfe and the Smith, Elder embossed bindings can be viewed in terms of continuity as well as of change in kind&#x2014;retaining and developing some design elements, 
                                as the new machine&#x2010;embossing technology was applied first to paper and then to leather.</div>

                                A perceived advantage of embossed leather appears to have been to combine luxury with durability, overcoming the need for a slipcase; however, <span class="persName-EJ">Eleanore Jamieson</span> comments that the leather bindings were not as practical as they appeared. 
                                The embossing could not withstand shelfwear, and the books remained on the drawing&#x2010;room table (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JAMIESONENGLISHEMBOSSEDBINDINGS" target="_self"><span class="title-book-"><i>English Embossed Bindings</i></span></a>, 3).</div>

                                As was being urged contemporaneously in a review of the annuals for <span class="date-1827">1827</span> in the <span class="title-periodical-LONDONMAGAZINE"><i>London Magazine</i></span>,

                                &#x201C;the colour . . . &#x005B;was&#x005D; varied&#x201D; in the leather binding &#x201C;for the gratification of different tastes&#x201D;

                                a formal floral and leaf pattern, suggestive of Renaissance or Rococo ornament, as distinct from <i>cathedral</i> patterns, in the style of Gothic architectural ornament

                                The cathedral style was associated with devotional publications, although, as we have seen, the printed boards and slipcase of the Relfe annual might be called <i>cathedral</i>.

                                would have suggested the bindings of prayer books and bibles&#x2014;the only bound stock, besides gift books, that retailers typically offered over the counter 
                                (as opposed to temporary paper&#x2010;covered boards, meant to be replaced by the consumer). These &#x201C;gospel&#x2010;like bindings&#x201D; may have been meant

                                If these associations are valid, then Smith, Elder might be viewed as maintaining the sacred connotation of Relfe&#x02BC;s binding; however, by replacing a cathedral design with an arabesque,
                                the later publisher may have disassociated their new look from a more specifically ecclesiastical appearance&#x2014;a possible source of anxiety, as the rise in popularity of the annuals in the later <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> coincided with the growing religious controversy surrounding the <span class="title-law-CATHOLICEMANCIPATION">Catholic Emancipation Act</span> of <span class="date-1829">1829</span>.</div>

                                The wrapper was a distinct style of <span class="date-1800-1899">nineteenth&#x2010;century</span> dust&#x2010;jacket that completely enclosed the book like gift&#x2010;wrapping,

                                    While the earlier bibliographic account fixated on the invention of cloth covers, which was developed in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> at about the same time as case bindings

                                    and he suggests that wrappers were especially associated with marketing the annuals and their predecessors, the pocket books. 
                                    The surviving wrapper for the <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1830"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering . . . for <span class="date-1830">MDCCCXXX</span></i></span> reveals that even this ephemeral paper covering was designed to flatter buyers with a luxury commodity. 
                                    Smith, Elder had it made from quality paper, and fastened its folds around the book with red sealing wax. The paper was printed so that, when folded properly, 
                                    the front, back, and spine of the package would show a decorated title, advertisements for additional collector&#x02BC;s items 
                                    (e.g., separate portfolios of the volume&#x02BC;s engravings), and the annual&#x02BC;s signature verse epigraph, which the buyer would find also inside, printed on the title page
