                  <span class="head-section">Founding of the Firm</span>
                  
                  <div class="p">The firm began in <span class="date-1816">1816</span> as a <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> stationer and bookseller, 
                    founded by two Scotsmen, <span class="persName-GS">George Smith</span> (<span class="date-1789-01-01-1846-08-21">1789–1846</span>) and <span class="persName-AE">Alexander Elder</span> (<span class="date-1790-01-01-1876-12-31">1790–1876</span>). 
                    According to <span class="persName-SSL">Sidney Lee</span>, the partners undertook their first modest publishing venture in <span class="date-1819">1819</span>, 
                    when they were admitted to the Stationersʼ Company, although more recently <span class="persName-BBELL">Bill Bell</span> has shown evidence 
                    that they began publishing in a small way from the beginning in <span class="date-1816">1816</span> 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#LEESMITHMEMOIR" target="_self"><span class="persName-SSL">Lee</span>, <span class="title-essay-LEESMITHMEMOIR">“Memoir of <span class="persName-GS">George Smith</span>”</span></a>, 3–4;

                    <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>ʼs initial dealings with the firm appear to have been as a customer of their stationery and books. 
                    For example, an entry in his household accounts for <span class="date-1827-06">June 1827</span> shows the notation,
                    “Paid for Books to Smith E”, followed by a list of titles 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFMS28" target="_self"><span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-manuscript-RFMS28">Account Book [<span class="date-1827-01-01-1845-12-31">1827–45</span>]</span></a>, 2r;

                    Thus, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> was among the “friendly Scotch <i>clientèle</i>” that, according to a history of the firm, Smith, Elder 
                    supplied with writing materials, books new and used, and bookbinding services in its early days, as suggested by the preponderance of Scottish titles of books and music recorded in a daybook

                  <div class="p">When first established, the premises were located in <span class="placeName-FENCHURCHST">Fenchurch Street</span>, near to the counting house of 
                    Ruskin, Telford, & Domecq in <span class="placeName-BILLITERST">Billiter Street</span>, which linked <span class="placeName-FENCHURCHST">Fenchurch Street</span> to <span class="placeName-LEADENHALLST">Leadenhall Street</span>

                    In <span class="date-1824">1824</span>, the firm moved one street farther west to 65 <span class="placeName-CORNHILL">Cornhill</span>; and taking on a third partner, it became Smith, Elder, & Company. 
                    An important part of the business was focused on exporting books and stationery to <span class="placeName-INDIA">India</span>, 
                    supplying British subjects stationed with the East India Company 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#LEESMITHMEMOIR" target="_self"><span class="persName-SSL">Lee</span>, <span class="title-essay-LEESMITHMEMOIR">“Memoir of <span class="persName-GS">George Smith</span>”</span></a>, 4–6). 
                    The headquarters of the East India Company, <span class="placeName-building-EASTINDIAHOUSE">East India House</span>, 
                    was situated close by (see <a href="/notes/london_city_note" target="_self">City of London</a>; see also <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self">Red Book</a>).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">It would have mattered to <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> that the founders of the firm, <span class="persName-GS">George Smith</span> and <span class="persName-AE">Alexander Elder</span> were,

                    mercantile opportunities and cultured, metropolitan lives in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>. They also opened a window onto the romance of literary life. 
                    <span class="persName-GS">Smith</span> had served in the firm of John Murray, the publisher of <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>, 
                    and even had the honor on one occasion to deliver proof sheets to the poet himself—or, in a more colorful version of the story, 
                    carried an inquiry about a new edition that caused <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span> to spring up and dance around the room

                  <div class="p">It was <span class="persName-AE">Elder</span> who oversaw the fledgling publishing arm of the business, however; 
                    and although the earlier memoirs characterize his involvement as “spasmodic”, <span class="persName-AE">Elder</span> counted as a central figure 
                    for the expatriate literary Scotsmen in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> during the <span class="date-1820-1839">1820s–30s</span>, 
                    according to <span class="persName-GH">Gillian Hughes</span>

                    Among these Scots émigré writers and editors were <a href="/notes/pringle_thomas_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-TP">Thomas Pringle</span> (<span class="date-1789-1834">1789–1834</span>)</a>

                    was key to the success of Smith, Elder & Company as a fine art and literary publisher. The firm took over this literary annual in <span class="date-1827">1827</span> from a neigboring bookseller 
                    in <span class="placeName-CORNHILL">Cornhill Street</span>, <span class="persName-LRPUBLISHER">Lupton Relfe</span>, and rapidly developed it from a pale imitation 
                    of Ackermannʼs <span class="title-annual-RAPFORGETMENOT"><i>Forget Me Not</i></span> 
                    into one of the best‐selling productions of the two‐decade reign of the <a href="/notes/annuals_note" target="_self">annuals</a>. The burgeoning innovations in visual and print culture 
                    that made the <a href="/notes/annuals_note" target="_self">annuals</a> a popular success—mass‐producible illustration such as steel engraving, along with mechanized bookbinding and papermaking—proved 
                    particularly effective in the firmʼs make‐over of <a href="/notes/friendships_offering_note" target="_self"><span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span></a>.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Again, <span class="persName-AE">Alexander Elder</span>ʼs tastes appear to have been key in the up‐to‐date and high quality of the firmʼs illustrated publications, 
                    for he was also an art enthusiast, and commissioned a number of ambitious portfolios of picturesque views. Among the earliest of these was 
                    <span class="title-artwork-"><i>Views in Scotland</i></span>,

                    a series of copper‐engraved views of the principal towns and historical sites of <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>, published in <span class="date-1824">1824</span>. 
                    Printed in aquatint, each plate sold at half a guinea, the series realizing a profit beyond the artistʼs substantial commission of £1,000

                    The high quality of art reproduction that the firm had achieved by the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> is testified by its role in producing 
                    <span class="title-book-GRINDLAYINDIA"><i>Scenery, Costumes and Architecture, Chiefly on the Western Side of India</i></span> (<span class="date-1826-1830">1826–30</span>)

                    which has been ranked “among the finest illustrated books ever produced” for the beauty and subtlety of its aquatints. Its first two parts were produced by 
                    the more experienced firm of Ackermann, but the remaining four parts by Smith, Elder

                    <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> certainly was on a familiar footing with the Ruskin family by <span class="date-1832-01">January 1832</span>,

                    Perhaps <span class="persName-CTR">Charles</span>ʼs gift to <span class="persName-JR">John</span> prompted <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> to seek the acquaintance. 
                    <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>ʼs editorship of the annual started in <span class="date-1828">1828</span>—his first volume being that for <span class="date-1829">1829</span>

                    This last volume, which featured the young <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs first poems for the annual, was substantially completed during the <span class="date-1834-06-21-1834-09-22">summer of 1834</span> 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#VIGNEPRINGLE" target="_self">Vigne, <i>Thomas Pringle</i></a>, 244). In the latter volume, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> made his first
