                  <div class="p">Readers of <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span> are familiar with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs description of the “trevelling chariot” used for the familyʼs summer holidays, 
                    which was lent by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs business partner, <a href="/notes/telford_henry_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-HT">Henry Telford</span> (d. <span class="date-1859">1859</span>)</a>, 
                    in the years of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs youth, “before my father thought it right to hire a carriage” for long journeys (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 35:29). 
                    In documentary evidence related to the Ruskinsʼ <span class="date-1827">1827</span> journey to <span class="placeName-Scotland">Scotland</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> lists a small expense 
                    connected with “chaise <span class="placeName-Perth">Perth</span>”—presumably, the <span class="persName-HT">Telford</span> carriage driven to <span class="placeName-Perth">Perth</span>, 
                    since the terms <i>post chaise</i>, <i>posting chariot</i>, and <i>travelling chariot</i> describe the same type of vehicle,

                  <div class="p">The terms <i>chariot</i> and <i>chaise</i> were applied to four‐wheeled vehicles of the same body type—the former typically referring 
                        to vehicles for town use, but which could be adapted to posting with removal of the coach box, and the latter to traveling carriages. 
                        A late eighteenth‐century source explains: as “a close carriage” that was “intended only for expeditious travelling”, the post‐chaise was considered “the most pleasant”, compared to a coach; 
                        “the view in front not being obstructed by a coach‐box, nor the draught impeded by any cumbersome weight: 
                        lightness and simplicity are the principles on which this carriage ought to be built, if intended for post work only”. 
                        However, “for travelling with on the continent”, the post‐chaise “require[d], like the coach, to be built strong, 
                        and finished with conveniences suitable for the journey”

                  <div class="p">Surviving examples of the post‐chaise or traveling chariot from the early nineteenth century can be viewed at the <span class="placeName-building-NTCARRIAGEMUSEUM">National Trust Carriage Museum</span> at <span class="placeName-ARLINGTON">Arlington</span>. 
                        As the museumʼs guidebook explains, the term <i>chariot</i> refers to the “shape of the body”, seating only two passengers—or as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> comments in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, 
                        “two persons and so much of third personage as I possessed at three years old”. A single seat is positioned “behind the doors” and facing the windows, which take up the front and sides. 
                        This configuration contrasts with the design of the heavier <i>coach</i>, which seated “four inside the body”—two couples facing one another, seated on either side of the doors in the middle of the coach body, 
                        one couple on “a seat ahead of the doors”, and the other couple on a seat “behind” the doors.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">In the chaise, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs seat as a small boy “was the little box containing my clothes, strongly made, with a cushion on one end of it”, which, “set upright in front (and well forward)”, 
                    afforded him a “horizon of sight the widest possible” through the large front windows and the adjacent side windows set in the doors. 
                    While <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> says he “was thus not the least in . . . [his parentsʼ] way”, his box would likely have obstructed a set of two folding panels, if 
                        the carriage was so equipped. These panels, as explained by the <span class="placeName-building-NTCARRIAGEMUSEUM">Carriage Museum</span> guidebook, could “be let down” from the wall beaneath the front windows, 
                        enabling “the inside passengers to stretch their legs at full length into the boot and sleep while they travelled”. 
                        If the <span class="persName-HT">Telford</span> carriage was equipped with such panels, perhaps <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs box could be shifted to one side in order to let down at least one of the two panels
