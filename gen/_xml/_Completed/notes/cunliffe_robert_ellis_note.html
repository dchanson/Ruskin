               <div class="p"><span class="persName-REC">Cunliffe</span> assembled a collection of drawings by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, which the editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> described in <span class="date-1912">1912</span> as 
                    “the choicest and most representative” among “private collections” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-books-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 38:224). 
                    The collection is significant to <i>ERM</i> because it was representative in the sense chronologically inclusive, with examples dating from as early as <span class="date-1833">1833</span> 
                    (see <a href="/notes/drawings_1833_note" target="_self">Drawings from the <span class="date-1833-05-14-1833-08-19">Tour of 1833</span></a>). 
                    <span class="persName-REC">Cunliffe</span> appears therefore to have been motivated by the biographical approach that characterized <span class="date-1867-1900">late‐century</span> collecting (see

                    According to <span class="persName-JSD">James S. Dearden</span>, <span class="persName-REC">Cunliffe</span> acquired most of his drawings from <span class="persName-JSAR">Joan Severn</span> at <span class="placeName-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span> 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#DEARDENCUNLIFFE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span>, <span class="title-essay-DEARDENCUNLIFFE">“The <span class="persName-REC">Cunliffe</span> Collection of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> Drawings”</span></a>, 238).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span> numbers 74 drawings in the collection at the time of <span class="persName-REC">Cunliffe</span>ʼs death, 66 of which he found listed in the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>ʼs 
                    <span class="title-catalogue-CATALOGUEOFRUSKINSDRAWINGSLE">“Catalogue of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs Drawings”</span>

                    In the <span class="title-catalogue-CATALOGUEOFRUSKINSDRAWINGSLE">“Catalogue”</span>, items from the collection are credited to “Mrs. Cunliffe”, 
                    because her husband had died prematurely a decade earlier, at age 54, from scarlet fever. He was a <span class="placeName-MANCHESTER">Manchester</span> solicitor, retired in <span class="date-1899">1899</span> to an estate named the <span class="placeName-building-CROFT">Croft</span> in <span class="placeName-AMBLESIDE">Ambleside</span>. 
                    In <span class="placeName-MANCHESTER">Manchester</span>, he had been active in the Literary and Philosophical Society, interested mainly in scientific pursuits

                    He and subsequently his wife loaned drawings to early exhibitions, such as the
