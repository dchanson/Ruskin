                            In the present note, precedents and problems in past approaches are summarized as a foundation for the rationale governing the editorial approach adopted in <i>ERM</i>. 
                            Past practices include separating genres and disciplines that Ruskin, in his youth, did not necessarily perceive as divided; 
                            isolating works from larger corpuses in which Ruskin experimented with anthologizing and recontexualizing those works; and imposing editorial policies with misguided aims of suppressing texts that editors deemed incomplete, 
                            while intrusively regularizing and even substantively revising texts that did get selected for publication.</div>

                        <span class="head-sub-subsection">The Editorial Division of Poetry from Prose</span>
                        
                        <div class="p">The first editors of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs early manuscripts divided the archive by genre, poetry from prose. 
                                The precedent for this division was set by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs father and his friend, 
                                <a href="/notes/harrison_w_h_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-WHH">W. H. Harrison</span> (ca. <span class="date-1792-1878">1792–1878</span>)</a>, 
                                when they collected a selection of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs early verse compositions in the anthology 
                                <a href="/notes/poems_1850_note" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1850"><i>Poems</i> (<span class="date-1850">1850</span>)</span> by <span class="persName-pen_name-JR">“J.R.”</span></a> 
                                For them, the anthology commemorated <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs erstwhile vocation as a poet, an ambition that they had devotedly supported as editors and promoters, but that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself had decisively abandoned. 
                                Nearly a half‐century later than this first project, the decision to separate the poetry from the prose was maintained by 
                                <a href="/notes/collingwood_w_g_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> (<span class="date-1854-1932">1854–1932</span>)</a> in his edition, 
                                <a href="/notes/poems_1891_note" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i> (<span class="date-1891">1891</span>)</span></a>. 
                                His choice arguably was driven or at least intensified by the cachet that, by the end of the century, had come to surround 
                                <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1850"><i>Poems</i> (<span class="date-1850">1850</span>)</span> as a scarce collectorʼs item. 
                                The heated rare‐book market surrounding the <span class="date-1850">1850</span> volume had already resulted in a pirated American edition of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poems—one of several piracies that threatened <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs income from his books 
                                (see <a href="/notes/poems_1891_note#PROVOCATION" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i> (<span class="date-1891">1891</span>)</span>: The Provocation of American Literary Piracy</a>). 
                                Animating all this interest in the poems was the charm of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs autobiographical narrative in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span> about his youthful career as a poet manqué.</div>
                        
                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> planned a complementary edition of prose, documenting <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs turn from poetry to criticism. 
                                This edition was never realized under <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs editorship. Ultimately, the project was hurriedly and inadequately compiled 
                                as the first volume, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE_EARLYPROSE"><i>Early Prose</i></span>, of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>, 
                                under the supervision of <a href="/notes/cook_e_t_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-ETC">E. T. Cook</span> (<span class="date-1857-1919">1857–1919</span>)</a> and

                                recent editions of early prose works that <a href="/notes/allen_george_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-GA">George Allen</span> (<span class="date-1832-1907">1832–1907</span>)</a> 
                                had revived, more with a view to producing handsome volumes for the collectorsʼ market and thwarting sales of American piracies, 
                                than with a serious scholarly purpose (see <a href="/notes/collecting_of_modern_authors_note" target="_self">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</a>).</div>
                        
                        <div class="p">While these editorial decisions were influenced by the market, the editions did not entirely lack scholarly merit, 
                                but their bibliographical underpinnings were flawed by the foundational decision to segregate poetry from prose. 
                                <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>, who had access to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs study in his home, <span class="placeName-building-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span>, 
                                was the first to undertake a descriptive and analytic bibliography of the early verse <i>manuscripts</i> (earlier 
                                bibliographers had described only the youthful <i>publications</i>) and he published his findings as the 
                                <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">“Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems”</span>, 
                                appended to volume 1 of the <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i> (<span class="date-1891">1891</span>)</span> 
                                (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS4D1891" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS4D1891"><i>Poems</i> [4<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>]</span></a>,1:261–67;

                                Whatever bibliographical attention <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> may have given to the prose manuscripts in his preparations, 
                                the <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">“Preliminary Note”</span> was rendered incomplete and lacking in evidence, 
                                owing to arbitrarily omitting entire manuscripts that contain solely prose. Even on its own terms as a bibliography of the poetry manuscripts, 
                                the <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">“Preliminary Note”</span> is problematic 
                                in neglecting to describe or explain prose works present in several of the manuscripts that the note does describe—or even to describe prose included <i>as part of</i> works composed primarily in verse.</div>
                        
                        <div class="p">In the <a href="/notes/library_edition_note" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span></a>, 
                                <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> addressed the problems raised by this division only imperfectly. 
                                The editors maintained <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs scheme of housing works separately by genre in the volumes, 
                                <span class="title-book-"><i>Early Prose</i></span> and <span class="title-book-"><i>Poems</i></span> (volumes 1 and 2, respectively), 
                                but in the prose volume they did not attempt to match <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">“Preliminary Note”</span> 
                                for the poetry with a corresponding bibliographical description of the prose manuscripts. Rather, in <span class="title-book-"><i>Early Prose</i></span> they hastily repackaged 
                                existing republications of early prose writings made in the <span class="date-1890-1899">1890s</span> by <span class="persName-GA">George Allen</span> along with their scanty bibliograpical notes. 
                                In <span class="title-book-"><i>Poems</i></span>, volume 2 of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>, 
                                the editors reprinted <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">“Preliminary Note”</span>, 
                                expanding it only with brief descriptions of some additional verse manuscripts, and with lists by title of the individual verse works contained in the manuscripts—a useful enough enhancement, 
                                so far as it went, but failing to question the fundamental logic or serviceability of separating the poetry manuscripts from the prose in the first place 
                                (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 2:529–41).</div>
                        
                        <div class="p">As <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> organized the manuscripts that they found at <span class="placeName-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span> 
                                during preparation of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>, their curatorship of the early manuscripts was based on the same arbitrary distinction. 
                                They separately bound some that contained texts of early prose exclusively, while gathering stray poems (including, inconsistently, some early prose) 
                                in <a href="/apparatuses/msia_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span></a>. They relegated description of the prose manuscripts 
                                (or some of them) to volume 38, the <span class="title-book-"><i>Bibliography</i></span> volume 
                                of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>, classifying these descriptions as “Juvenilia”—leaving open the question 
                                of what should be comprised under that term, if not also the early poetry manuscripts listed separately in the <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">“Preliminary Note”</span>. 
                                Thus, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs editorial scheme—which, if flawed in its logic, had at least beeen carried out consistently and reasonably accurately—was now also 
                                confused by inconsistency and unevenness of bibliographical description and editorial procedure in the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">In <i>ERM</i>, rather than perpetuating the late nineteenth‐century conceptualization of the early manuscripts in terms of a vocational watershed between poetry and prose, 
                                our ambition is to organize the archive around a creatively dynamic tension perceivable throughout the early writing—a tension, less between poetry and prose 
                                than between a unitary work, whether in verse or prose, and its potential to join and alter a larger anthology or collection, 
                                and also a dynamism between traditional genres and their potential to join with others to form a composite. 
                                In the manuscripts of the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> known to the Ruskin family as the <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self">Red Books</a>, 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> projected his prose compositions as “volumes” of <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">“Harry and Lucy Concluded”</span>, 
                                intended as an ongoing multi‐volume series, while filling out each of these “volumes” 
                                with poems collected into small anthologies. Later, he advanced beyond volumes that compiled multiple genres to design unitary works 
                                as multi‐genre anthologies in themselves, as in the <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus" target="_self">Account of a Tour on the Continent</a> 
                                (<span class="date-1833-1834">1833–34</span>)—a work initially composed as a travelogue solely in verse, 
                                and then re‐conceived as a composite‐genre travelogue in verse, prose, and picture. 
                                Thus, in his youth, while <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> learned to observe conventional generic boundaries in many of his poetic, scientific, and theological manuscripts, 
                                he was also constantly intrigued by their dynamic interrelatedness. To represent this dynamism of container and contained, 
                                we exploit the 〈teiCorpus〉 element of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) markup,

                                In fact, many of <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs choices appear to have resulted, not from systematic emendation at all,

                                (see, e.g., <a href="/notes/bibliography#HANSONMATERIALITY" target="_self"><span class="persName-DCH">Hanson</span>, <span class="title-essay-HANSONMATERIALITY">“Materiality in John Ruskinʼs Early Letters and Dialogues”</span></a>),

                                Accordingly, the logical terminus a quo for the chronological inclusion of manuscripts lies with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs earliest extant poem,

                                since the emerging biographical consensus followed <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs autobiography in perceiving <span class="date-1843">1843</span> as the debut of his

                                Paradoxically, in the case of juvenilia, attempts to define and circumscribe the scope of a body of early writing can undermine the perceived value of the editorial project. 
                                As <span class="persName-CAA">Alexander</span> and <span class="persName-JMCM">McMaster</span> comment, 
                                establishing an end‐point of an authorʼs “apprentice” work tends to reflect backward 
                                on the early writing in negative terms, owing to pejorative connotations of the terms used to characterize 
                                the writing, including the term <i>juvenilia</i> itself. For example, the separation between the Brontë sistersʼ early writing and the novels has often been approached 
                                as a “problem” in a derogatory sense, with the <i>juvenile</i> understood to persist as a kind of lingering debilitation

                                has traced child writing as a literary historical phenomenon from the eighteenth through the early nineteenth centuries. 
                                Although <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth‐century</span> writers may seem themselves to have sanctioned a moralistic and negative assessment of their early writing, characterizing their transition away from juvenilia as a righteous rite of passage, 
                                <span class="persName-KEB">Kate E. Brown</span>, among others, has revealed considerable complexity in this imaginary, by re‐examining how <span class="persName-CBW">Charlotte Brontë</span> (<span class="date-1816-1855">1816–55</span>) 
                                thought about her transition from <i>juvenilia</i> to the novel, <span class="title-book-BRONTEPROFESSOR"><i>The Professor</i></span> 
                                (composed ca. <span class="date-1844-1846">1844–46</span>; published <span class="date-1857">1857</span>). By characterizing this novel in its preface as a “little book”, 
                                <span class="persName-CBW">Brontë</span> emphasized its material form (she contended for a single‐volume publication, contrary to publishersʼ three‐volume standard). 
                                By dwelling on the novelʼs smallness, <span class="persName-CBW">Brontë</span>ʼs preface works to connect <span class="title-book-BRONTEPROFESSOR"><i>The Professor</i></span> with the juvenilia—distinctively, 
                                a collection of little books in their material form—more than the preface disassociates the novel from early writing. As <span class="persName-CBW">Brontë</span> writes: 
                                “A first attempt it [the novel] certainly was <i>not</i>, as the pen which wrote it had been previously worn a good deal in a practice of some years”—an assertion of the continuity of the writing life that is again figured in terms of material associations, the worn pen. 
                                At the same time, <span class="persName-CBW">Brontë</span> falls into the defensive reflex of denigrating the value of the juvenilia, by erasing its existence as quickly as she invokes it, 
                                claiming to have “destroyed almost as soon as” she created these earlier “crude effort[s]”. 
                                (That claim was false, but at the time of the ca. <span class="date-1851">1851</span> preface, the miniature <span class="persName-CBW">Brontë</span> juvenilia were unknown outside the family; 
                                and as <span class="persName-KEB">Brown</span> remarks, <span class="persName-CBW">Charlotte</span> had grown secretive about the little books and the sagas they contained, 
                                wary even of mentioning them to close friends. The miniature manuscripts came to light publicly after <span class="persName-">Charlotte</span>ʼs death, when her husband briefly entrusted a “packet” of the manuscripts to <span class="persName-EGASKELL">Elizabeth Gaskell</span>, 
                                who then described them in her <span class="date-1857">1857</span> <span class="title-book-GASKELLLIFEOFBRONTE"><i>Life of Charlotte Brontë</i></span>.) 
                                <span class="persName-KEB">Brown</span> links the secrecy with which <span class="persName-CBW">Charlotte</span> enshrouded the juvenile manuscripts, along with their distinctive materiality, 
                                with the episode in <span class="title-book-BRONTEVILLETTE"><i>Villette</i></span> (<span class="date-1853">1853</span>) in which <span class="persName-fictional-LUCYSNOWE">Lucy Snowe</span> preserves letters from <span class="persName-fictional-JOHNBRETTON">John Bretton</span> 
                                by sealing and burying them beneath the roots of the  “nunʼs tree”. Such actions invest the written artifacts with significance as “beloved objects”, 
                                which, <span class="persName-">Brown</span> argues, are not repudiated but disavowed.  “Repudiation seeks to obviate a loss by claiming it as oneʼs own desire, 
                                rejecting the lost object of love in an effort to restore self‐esteem. . . . [D]isavowal offers more contradictory satisfactions: 
                                it both denies and accedes to loss so as to perpetuate grief”, allowing “for two mutually exclusive responses to coexist”—namely, 
                                responding to loss by “at once memorializing a lost love” in the beloved object and by “denying its loss”

                            began to sway literary scholars toward a more sociological approach focused on study of the textual artifact in its cultural moment. 
                            Historians came meanwhile to recognize that, in their allegedly purist views of documentary editing, they had tended to overlook their own interventionist and “literary” practices

                            <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> can be credited with favoring a more consistently historical approach than <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs, 
                            given <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>ʼs policy of printing unpublished materials, albeit selectively and in heavily edited versions. In any case, a diplomatic approach to transcribing 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscripts became the norm with the editorial labors of <span class="persName-VAB">Van Akin Burd</span>. 
                            Victorian studies was influenced by <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>ʼs <span class="date-1973">1973</span> edition, <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>The Ruskin Family Letters</i></span>, 
                            which comprehensively collected the entire familyʼs historical papers—the <i>family</i> 
                            letters—as requisite to scholarship, rather than limiting the published correspondence to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs side, narrowly viewed as a literary accomplishment. 
                            <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> also attempted faithfully to reproduce the idiosyncrasies of the Ruskinsʼ punctuation, 
                            recognizing how the pulse of thought can be revealed in the hand. The reader is treated as a confidante, comprehending the fullness of the family conversation, 
                            and brought closer to the young <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs responsive thought and feeling. As <span class="persName-SE">Sheila Emerson</span> observes, 
                            the frequent lack of punctuation in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs early writing provides reflects how he 
                            “bound his phrases each to each” and allowed “their movement [to jam] back and forth in the mind” 
                            (<a href="/notes/bibliography#EMERSONGENESISOFINVENTION" target="_self">Emerson, <span class="title-book-EMERSONGENESISOFINVENTION"><i>Genesis of Invention</i></span></a>, 27). 
                            This view was shared even by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs mother, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>, 
                            who “let <span class="persName-JR">John</span>s letters come just as he writes them”, as she explained to <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> when enclosing their sonʼs letters inside her own,
                            in order “that you may not be misled in your judgment as to his hopes and feelings”

                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in manuscript, where syntax and punctuation “convey clearly the flow of his ideas and spirit at the moment of writing. 
                            His punctuation, while unconventional, is logical and expressive of the pause, pitch, and stress of his sentences”. <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> admits doubt 
                            “that print can reproduce the individuality of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs punctuation”; 
                            and after a long paragraph entrancingly describing the meaning of every eccentric stroke, his regret is palpable that any endeavor by an editor

                            can result only in a pale reflection of the experience of reading a <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> letter in manuscript. 
                            The most exacting documentary transcription, <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> declares, can “never record the story told by his handwriting, which often reflects his moods”, 
                            and he defies the “printed page [to] convey the pleasure of opening . . . [<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs] 4½ by 2½ inch

                     <div class="p">In the evolution of <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>ʼs justification of a diplomatic approach to manuscript transcription—first appealing to re‐creation of an intimacy with a writer, and later arguing for a historical rationale—his 
                            editions reflect a longer trend in manuscript and book collecting. 
                            Late‐Victorian collectors sought first editions by “modern” (i.e., nineteenth‐century) writers in the belief that the physical book produced closest in time to the authorʼs composition 
                            carried a personal connection with a writer. In manuals on book collecting, this “sentiment” borne by first editions was figuratively expressed, as it later was by <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> in his most enthusiastic writing, as if following 
                            the authorʼs hand on his writing table. Subsequently, the New Bibliographers of the <span class="date-1930-1939">1930s</span> rejected 
                            such sentiment in favor of more “objective” approaches 
                            (see <a href="/notes/collecting_of_modern_authors_note" target="_self">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</a>; 
                            and <a href="/notes/bibliography#HANSONSENTIMENTANDMATERIALITY" target="_self">Hanson, “Sentiment and Materiality in Late‐Victorian Book Collecting”</a>). 
                            In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> studies, a sentiment of intimacy with the author through collecting or manuscript study seems to have persisted longer, 
                            perhaps because <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself sought such immediacy of connection with audiences by commenting on the materiality of writing, 
                            whether as dramatized in <span class="title-book-JRFORS"><i>Fors Claivigera</i></span> as the act of writing thwarted by piercing steam whistles, 
                            or as represented in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span> by a facsimile of his boyhood writing for whatever it might reveal about his youth. 
                            Added to this encouragement by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in his published work to think about his writing as a physical act was the historical accident 
                            of manuscripts remaining at <span class="placeName-building-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span> for discovery by <span class="persName-HGV">Helen Gill Viljoen</span> 
                            prior to their dispersal in the estate sales—an experience that made her suspect of any form of editorial intervention that might operate as a conspiracy 
                            against <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs ideas. Likewise <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>,

                            jumps quickly from the record of past editorsʼ attempts to regularize <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs punctuation and grammar 
                            to an accusation that what past editors truly sought was to suppress (quoting <span class="persName-CEN">Charles Eliot Norton</span>) 
                            the “‘too personal, too intimate, or of too slight interest’”

                            Since the era of the New Bibliographers, the widening access to manuscripts via ever more spectacularly vivid digitization has brought only renewed skepticism 
                            about creating the illusion of reproducing the real thing. In <i>ERM</i>, our aim is neither to accuse manuscript studies or first‐edition collecting of “sentimentality” nor to defend the “aura” of objects; 
                            rather, in annotation and markup of transcriptions taken from original materials in almost all cases, 
                            and in exhibition of these transcriptions alongside digital facsimiles where possible, our aim is to realize a model that,

                            he often meant his punctuation, many orthographic styles, and other aspects of presentation to reflect, less his inner world, than the print and pictorial culture surrounding him, in an era as visually stimulating as our own.</div>

                     <div class="p">Pursuing his physical imitation to small typographical features, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> invented marks 
                            that present the digital encoder with odd challenges in markup. For example, in order to fully justify his hand‐printed text on the right as well as left margins, as in a printed book, 
                            he invented an end‐of‐line mark that resembles a hyphen, but that varies in length according to what he needed to fill out the measure of a line, 
                            where words fell short of the right‐justified margin. (<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> continued employing this end‐of‐line mark as late as <span class="date-1834-1835">1834–35</span> 
                            in his most elaborate and sophisticated imitation of the print culture of illustrated travel literature, the <a href="/witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix" target="_self">MS IX fair copy</a> of his

To encode this mark as a hyphen would be misleading (particularly since he also used hyphens at the ends of some lines to divide syllables across the break), 
                            whereas to ignore the mark altogether would be implicitly to assert that the materiality 
                            of text has no bearing on how we study and think about the youthful productions of nineteenth‐century authors. In this instance, <i>ERM</i> 
                            uses the TEI glyph element, 〈g〉, assigning it the @type “justification”. This is an interpretation, 
                            not a neutrally objective encoding of horizontal strokes occurring at the ends of lines, but documentary editing that is innocent of editorial interpretation is neither possible nor desirable, 
                            if the purpose is to understand how Ruskin both appropriated the appearance of print and constrained his invention to obey its rules (see 
                            <a href="/notes/bibliography#PIERAZZODIGITALSCHOLARLYEDITING" target="_self"><span class="persName-EPIERAZZO">Pierazzo</span>, <span class="title-book-PIERAZZODIGITALSCHOLARLYEDITING"><i>Digital Scholarly Editing</i></span></a>, 101). 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs early manuscripts are already interpretations, in presenting themselves as “printed” works. In cases of punctuation marks too enigmatic 
                            to interpret, the recurring pattern is assigned markup and annotated with a provisional explanation, but no definitive interpretation is imposed. Also, no characters or punctuation marks are ignored that can reasonably be inferred as intentional. 
                            Even if we must temporize about how to interpret and encode what we see, we avoid the inefficiency of passing over puzzling transcription to be captured later

                     <div class="p">Which of these categories of <i>private</i>, <i>confidential</i>, or <i>public</i> applies to juvenilia and youthful writing? Juvenilia often imitate public forms by mimicking 
                            the appearance of published documents, yet the audience is normally confined to the family circle. <span class="persName-DHR">Reiman</span> 
                            considers a case of manuscript juvenilia, <span class="persName-JA">Jane Austen</span>ʼs (<span class="date-1775-1817">1775–1817</span>) 
                            <span class="title-book-AUSTENVOLUMETHEFIRST"><i>Volume the First</i></span> (begun ca. <span class="date-1786-1787">1786–87</span>), 
                            and proposes a special subcategory, “<i>polished</i> private and confidential manuscripts”,
                            which takes into account the conditions of authorship that developed during the <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth‐century</span> “age of printing”. 
                            Professional authors in the nineteenth century came to realize “that their final manuscripts were way stations on the road to a perfected text, rather than the thing itself”; 
                            accordingly, “the manuscript no longer carried the same textual authority that it once had, even when it represented the authorʼs final involvement in such matters as the orthography and punctuation 
                            of most of the text”. Authors in the age of print sent “their work to press . . . anticipating—and in many cases hoping—that changes in the text 
                            or its presentation [would] be introduced by the printers or the publishers”. Not so, manuscript “poems or other compositions that were intended for the perusal 
                            of a few specific individuals—in short, <i>private</i> or <i>confidential</i> documents”—that the author 
                            fair‐copied for limited distribution, but did not intend for publication. These kinds of artifacts, which include nineteenth‐century juvenilia, 
                            bear authority comparable to that of scribal copies of pre‐modern manuscripts, which “the writer never expected . . . to be superseded 
                            by a more authoritative printed text. Such a manuscript had to be more carefully prepared than a press copy, because it would neither be vetted by publisherʼs 
                            readers and compositors nor corrected in proof”

                            whereas from the standpoint of the child author, the model of nineteenth‐century print culture empowered the writer by taking into oneself the structures of editorial authority and bookmaking. 
                            The materiality—the polish—of nineteenth‐century juvenilia is as significant as the rhetorical and textual relation between author and a private or confidential audience, 
                            because, as <span class="persName-CAA">Christine Alexander</span> remarks about the embodiment by child authors of the specifically nineteenth‐century phenomenon of magazine culture, 
                            the serious play of appropriating this material world of print prevented the writer from “simply being colonized by the teaching adult”, 
                            and instead enabled the writer and maker to “coloniz[e] the adult world itself by remaking it in the image of the self; and it is by this process 
                            that the child discovers the self” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#ALEXANDERPLAYANDAPPRENTICESHIP" target="_self"><span class="persName-CAA">Alexander</span>, <span class="title-essay-ALEXANDERPLAYANDAPPRENTICESHIP">“Play and Apprenticeship: The Culture of Family Magazines”</span></a>, 31).</div>

                            Here, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs parents not only can decide who is privy to their sonʼs manuscripts but they also evidently exercise their own ideas about which poems are appropriate to be shared. 
                            If the parcel contained fair copies in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs hand, then the authority implicit in the polish

                            suggests that readers perceived authority in the material artifact itself, which bore direct witness to the authority of the writer—or 
                            of something about the writer. “I let <span class="persName-JR">John</span>s letters come just as he writes them”, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> explained to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> when enclosing their sonʼs letters inside her own,

                            <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> assumes a Romantic idea about writing as an open window to the writerʼs expression, which if copied in her own hand 
                            would not only lose authority, but even potentially mislead the reader. 
                            There do survive manuscript copies of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs works in his parentsʼ and othersʼ hands, but these are far less common than <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs own fair copies; 
                            and it seems unlikely that what <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> wanted the Grays to “see”—not just read—would have been a fair copy in her own hand, 
                            which derived authority from her adult sophistication of punctuation, spelling, orthography, and the like. 
                            Rather, “judgment as to [the child writerʼs] hopes and feelings” derived from an intimate experience and knowledge that were available 
                            only through the authoritative original artifact; and by virtue of the artifactʼs materiality, 
                            this experience could be extended to a trusted confidential circle.</div>
                        
                        <div class="p">Evidence suggests that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> shared this sense of an intended confidential audience that, in <span class="persName-DHR">Reiman</span>ʼs defintion, 
                            was most likely “personally known to or interested in the author”.  
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs understanding of these conditions is indicated by his inclusion of a letter to the Graysʼ relation,

                            By including a letter to <span class="persName-MONROROBERTMRS">Mrs. Monro</span> as part of the handsewn pamphlet, which consists otherwise entirely of poems, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> appears implicitly to invite <span class="persName-MONROROBERTMRS">Mrs. Monro</span> to form part his confidential audience beyond the immediate family circle. 
                            The designation “Works”, moreover, attests to the significance of this production, both as a physical thing, a “volume”,
                            and as an abstract promise of more to come.</div>
                        
                        <div class="p">It follows that, as an editorial procedure appropriate to a manuscriptʼs classification as a polished confidential production, 
                            an edition of <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth‐century</span> juvenilia should include manuscript images, as does <i>ERM</i>; 
                            diplomatic, and not eclectic or otherwise “corrected” transcriptions of texts; 
                            and a thorough physical description of the manuscript. In <i>fin de siècle</i> editions of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs early poems and prose, 
                            some interest in the physical manuscripts was attested by facsimiles of selected manuscript pages, 
                            although the basis of selection was rarely made evident, and the sparseness of such examples, which was doubtless legislated in part by cost, was probably limited also by 
                            a perception that such images satisfied curiosity rather than providing essential scholarly information. Manuscript facsimiles in these editions, 
                            like reproductions of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs drawings, were printed on heavier paper stock and bound only into the large‐paper,

                            and not in the inexpensive octavo editions. In the <a href="/notes/library_edition_note" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span></a>, 
                            manuscript facsimiles seem to gain scholarly purpose, but in fact the manuscripts selected for reproduction tend to be as random and lacking in context 
                            as those in <span class="persName-GA">George Allen</span>ʼs collectorʼs editions of the youthful writing, which he published in the <span class="date-1890-1899">1890s</span>. 
                            The early editors did supply descriptive bibliographies of the manuscripts, but the descriptions were limited in detail; and as argued above in 
                            <a href="#DEFINING">Defining <i>Works</i> and <i>Manuscripts</i></a>, lost even more coherence and consistency

                            in “large‐paper” editions as curiosities for specialized collectors. Once the readership was widened beyond collectors to include the anonymous, 
                            public consumption of a “common” edition, such curiosities were dropped, while the editorʼs duty remained only (in both common and collectorsʼ editions) to 
                            intervene heavily in the texts in order to “improve” them according to a public standard of uniform punctuation and formal decorum. 
                            As <span class="persName-CAA">Christine Alexander</span> comments, in late‐Victorian editions 
                            of nineteenth‐century authorsʼ juvenilia, heavy‐handed “improvement” of texts was typical of editorial approaches 
                            to what were condescendingly termed an authorʼs juvenile “effusions”.
                            <span class="persName-CAA">Alexander</span> contends that these “poorly transcribed, bowdlerized and ‘improved’” texts 
                            wholely “reinforce the attitude of inferiority towards early works and show the kind of 
                            disrespect for childhood that was common well into the twentieth century”—perhaps a somewhat overstated claim, given that
                            this attitude was tempered by editorsʼ acknowledgement of the special artifactual status that juvenile manuscripts held for their original, confidential readership

                            Nonetheless this materiality retained its value primarily among collectors and did not affect the the editorʼs mission to “improve” the texts for a modern, anonymous audience.</div>

                                by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> (e.g., a poem, an essay, a
                                sermon, a mathematical proof), including all available witnesses of that
                                text (each of these edited and annotated), and accompanied by the
                                workʼs explanatory apparatus and available facsimiles.</li>
                        
                        <li>A <i>manuscript</i> is a physical document manifesting
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs texts. 
                                A given work may be confined, so far as presently known, to a single text witness found in a single manuscript; 
                                or a work may be made up of multiple text witnesses found in more than one manuscript.</li>

                     <div class="p">In the archive, a work is represented by diplomatic transcriptions of all available witnesses, from its manuscript through its nineteenth‐century 
                                published instantiations, the range typically terminating in a version published in the

                                All transcriptions are annotated with glosses, both textual and contextual,

                     <div class="p">Traditionally in Ruskin studies, major manuscripts, which were originally bound notebooks or bound later by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs editors, 
                            were numbered by the editors; and the manuscriptsʼ nomenclature and physical arrangement were retained 
                            when distributed among various repositories. In <i>ERM</i>, these major manuscripts 
                            are each represented by a critical apparatus; and facsimiles of the major manuscripts are presented both in whole 
                            and in part, divided into pages associated with each of the discreet <i>works</i> that make up the contents of the manuscripts.</div>

                                which is hyperlinked throughout the archive, includes notes summarizing biographical, bibliographical, geographical, and contextual information. 
                                For illustrating the Ruskin family journeys, maps with timelines are under development 
                                (see <a href="/notes/plan_of_archive_note" target="_self">Plan of the Archive</a>).</div>

                            and a given manuscriptʼs Manuscript Pages. This design was initially based on the organization of

                            Similarly, these earlier patterns of organization were reflected in the approaches to bibliographical description by 
                            <a href="/notes/viljoen_h_g_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-HGV">Helen Viljoen</span></a>.

                            of <span class="persName-VAB">Van Akin Burd</span>, when <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span>ʼs papers remained in his keeping, 
                            and later when <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> deposited her papers at the Pierpont Morgan Library.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">While building on these past approaches, <span class="persName-DCH">Hanson</span> came to recognize how the organization of the archive into separate <i>works</i> with their respective bodies of commentary—poems, 
                            essays, sermons, and so on—lent necessary bibliographic commentary but concealed a dynamic tension that interested <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>—a 
                            tension between a given textual work and the material manuscript containing it, the container often presenting 
                            possibilities for expansion that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> exploited and explored. From the earliest juvenilia, 
                            he was evidently fascinated by the dynamic potential of a work to contain or be contained by something else. 
                            If <i>ERM</i> carried on in the path of earlier editions, 
                            routinely separating “lexical codes” from “bibliographical codes” according to historical precedent, 
                            we would achieve apparent clarity on the archive but at the expense of a characteristically Ruskinian feature.</div>

                     <div class="p">Editing the early <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscripts calls for representing both the integrity of a unitary work 
                            and what <span class="persName-NF">Neil Fraistat</span> terms its <i>contexture</i>—the workʼs 
                            potential to contribute to some grander stage of organization (<a href="/notes/bibliography#FRAISTATPOEMANDTHEBOOK" target="_self"><span class="persName-NF">Fraistat</span>, <span class="title-book-FRAISTATPOEMANDTHEBOOK"><i>The Poem and the Book</i></span></a>, 4).
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> used his manuscripts to build contexture among the works they contain, sometimes exploring loose associations among rapidly drafted, successive fragments in the rough‐draft notebooks, 
                            <a href="/apparatuses/msvi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span></a> and <a href="/apparatuses/msviii_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span></a>, 
                            and sometimes treating manuscripts as “volumes” or miscellanies in an expanding corpus—the individual volumes themselves often made up partly of anthologies, as 
                            found in several of the <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self">Red Books</a> and in

                            To represent both the contexture of the unitary work and the integrity of the unitary work in itself, 
                            <i>ERM</i> uses the TEI element, 〈teiCorpus〉, 
                            combined with standoff markup using <span class="title-program-XINCLUDE">XInclude</span>. Since 〈teiCorpus〉 can both contain and be contained by other 〈teiCorpus〉 documents,

                            likewise recognized as the chief entity of the archive, and which he numbered 
                            according to a rough chronological sequence by roman numeral in his <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">“Preliminary Note”</span>.
                            In the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>, <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> expanded on

                            listing the titles in the sequence in which they occur (which is not necessarily an indication of their order of composition). 
                            They did the same for collections that were not originally bound, rather that they had gathered and bound themselves (usually in red buckram), entitled with a roman numeral, 
                            and inserted into their expanded version of <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">“Preliminary Note”</span>. 
                            This attention to the bound manuscript as a container did not fundamentally affect editorial practice in either <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs or

                            their practices still centered on the discrete text, presented chronologically. In <i>ERM</i> likewise, we transcribe and annotate discrete works 
                            (using a documentary approach, not the earlier editorsʼ eclectic and aesthetic approaches), but we also seek to describe 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs strategies for contexture. The results are expressed as what the user finds listed on the Index Page

                            which he conceptualized filling (at least initially) in some cases as “volumes” in a series, 
                            such as the volumes of the “Harry and Lucy” lessons, along with their complementary poetry anthologies (e.g.,

                            and which he formed in other cases as miscellanies, such as the

                     <div class="p">The distinction between corpora and major manuscripts admittedly is ambiguous, with the contexture of corpora elevated by only a degree of intentionality above that of major manuscripts—the 
                            latter exhibiting looser but still definable contexture, such as <a href="/apparatuses/msv_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span></a>, 
                            which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> compiled incrementally, open‐endedly, and apparently somewhat randomly, 
                            one fair‐copy poem after another, yet still definably as “Miscellaneous Poetry”. 
                            In terms of TEI markup, both corpora and manuscripts are enclosed by the same 〈teiCorpus〉 element. 
                            The slippage of one category into the other reflects <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs 
                            own dynamic process of containment and expansion. He was even apt at times, like <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span>, to think of the entirety 
                            of his “works” as a single corpus, as suggested by his annotation on 
                            <a href="/apparatuses/msii_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span></a>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">A more conventional way of representing anthologies in TEI markup is to enclose multiple, related texts with the 〈group〉 element. 
                            Since this element can nest only within a 〈TEI〉 document, 
                            and unlike 〈teiCorpus〉 cannot itself contain a 〈TEI〉 document, 
                            the 〈group〉 element is too inflexible to accommodate <i>ERM</i>ʼs design for both single works and corpora or manuscripts. 
                            Single works are represented by multiple 〈TEI〉 documents—typically, an apparatus, multiple witnesses and facsimiles, and glosses—while 
                            corpora and manuscripts are also represented by multiple 〈TEI〉 documents, including an apparatus plus the sequence of works comprised by the collection 
                            (each work again consisting of its multiple 〈TEI〉 documents). An advantage that the 〈group〉 element holds over 〈teiCorpus〉 
                            is that the former is designed to accommodate a 〈head〉 element, which would more satisfyingly encode a title, such as 
                            <span class="title-anthology-MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">“Poetry” [MS I Poetry Anthology]</span>, as compared with what is shown in the sample markup above. 
                            Instead, using 〈teiCorpus〉, either one must attach the anthology title as a 〈head〉 to the germane witness of the first item in the anthology, 
                            which is badly formed markup; or, as we have done above, one must insert the title as a separate TEI document. Arguably, however, 
                            the latter procedure is as well‐formed as it is valid in the frequent cases in which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs titles and title pages 
                            refuse to conform to the structures that the 〈group〉 element was designed to describe. The 〈teiCorpus〉 element more flexibly 
                            accounts for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs dynamic play with the relation between container and contained.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">For example, in the originally blank, pre‐bound notebook that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> named

                            and that the Ruskin family knew as one of the <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self">Red Books</a>, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> used the inside front endboard to make a title page for a text,

                            possibly intending the work, at least initially, to be coextensive with the entirety of the physical notebook 
                            (see <a href="/apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_apparatus#TITLE" target="_self"><span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">“Harry and Lucy Concluded”</span>: Title</a>, and 
                            <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus#TITLE" target="_self">MS I: Title</a>). Whatever his initial plan was, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            completed <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">“Volume I”</span> of this prose work without filling the notebook—a terminus
                            that he declared by inscribing “end of Harry and Lucy”, and carrying on by adding an anthology,

                     <div class="p">This colophon reflects the play of closure by declaring a second ending—the “end of the poems”—specifying 
                            the end of the poetry anthology. This declaration was erased by somebody, using a rough pencil scratchout, 
                            perhaps in order to shift the emphasis to the end of a larger entity comprising 
                            <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">volume 1 of “Harry and Lucy”</span> plus the poetry anthology, 
                            <span class="title-anthology-MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">“Poetry”</span>. The colophon had perceptibly altered the usage of “volume” 
                            on the original title page of <span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span>, which was clearly meant to apply only to the prose work. 
                            Were we instead to use the 〈group〉 element, which calls for a 〈front〉 element to contain frontmatter, we could not represent a title page 
                            that is in flux. We may not have described <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs dynamically developing ideas much more vividly using 〈teiCorpus〉, but at least we have not misrepresented his ideas.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Our usage of 〈teiCorpus〉 also permits description of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs manuscripts and corpora as collaborative or mediated documents, 
                            which were sometimes glossed by his parents. We do not know who scored through “end of the poems” in the colophon of 
                            <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>, 
                            but it was certainly <span class="persName-MR">Ruskinʼs mother</span> who inserted a gloss 
                            amid the poems making up <a href="/apparatuses/msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-anthology-MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">“Poetry” [MS I Poetry Anthology]</span></a>. 
                            She wanted to date precisely her sonʼs beginning and completion of the manuscript. 
                            The determinacy of <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs gloss, with its definite “this book begun” and “finished”,
                            competes with the ambivalent play of <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs closure 
                            (see <a href="/apparatuses/mr_gloss_dating_msi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-gloss-MRGLOSSMSI">Margaret Ruskinʼs Gloss on the Dating of MS I</span></a>). 
                            While not necessarily intended to impose her will on the manuscript, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs gloss proved 
                            as ambiguous as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs own colophon, 
                            since both were followed by a new work entered on the inside back endboard—an emblematical drawing, 
                            <a href="/figures/heights_of_wisdom_drawing_msi" target="_self">“Heights of Wisdom, Depth of Fools”</a>, which 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> dated a few months later than <span class="persName-MR">his mother</span>ʼs gloss. 
                            Such play, whether including an edge of competitiveness or joy of collaboration, cannot be fully described in terms of an 
                            <span class="title-program-XML">XML</span> structure; the dynamics of play can be interpreted and discussed only in the archiveʼs commentary. 
                            However, the contributions of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs parents are very often convincingly encoded as glosses, 
                            which are not in the same class as the editorʼs explanatory and textual glosses that hang from and refer only to specific texts, 
                            but which form stand‐alone TEI documents (including their own apparatuses and transcriptions) 
                            referring to and forming part of the corpus as a whole.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Finally, the 〈teiCorpus〉 markup also easily allows for reordering corpora athwart manuscripts. In the case of

                            an eclectic editorial approach was adopted both by <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> and by <span class="persName-ETC">E. T. Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Alexander Wedderburn</span> 
                            on the grounds that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> left extensive writing for the work in draft 
                            along with an ambitious outline for arranging and completing the work; however, prior to realizing that plan, he abandoned the fair copy, 
                            requiring copytext to be drawn from both the fair copy and the draft. <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> justified his approach in <span class="date-1891">1891</span> as follows: 
                            “[A]s I find from a list at the end of . . . <a href="/apparatuses/msviii_apparatus" target="_self">[MS] VIII</a>”

                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> “intended this volume [i.e., the <a href="/witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix" target="_self">MS IX fair copy</a>] 
                            to contain about 150 pieces of prose and poetry, and at least as many drawings! 
                            And in saying [in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>] that he did not follow his tour beyond the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Mr. Ruskin</span> 
                            refers only to this volume, <a href="/apparatuses/msix_apparatus" target="_self">No. IX</a>”, and not to what he had in fact composed. 
                            “I am pretty certain that he was not aware of the amount of material existing in rough copies at the back of his book‐shelves”

                            which includes both poems and prose sections; and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs multiple versions of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>, 
                            whereby he evolved the work from a poetic travelogue in collaboration with his father into a composite work of poetry, prose, and illustration.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Other compelling candidates for separately and eclectically edited corpora witnessing a composite work include a compilation of the “volumes”

                            While arguably the five handsewn booklets containing the fair copies of the sermons 
                            can be treated as a single corpus, the various <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self">Red Books</a> 
                            containing rough drafts of the sermons present a particularly attenuated claim on the texts as composing a portion of their corpora considered as manuscripts.

                            <span class="persName-">David Vander Meulen</span> and <span class="persName-">G. Thomas Tanselle</span>: 
                            “the transcriberʼs goal is to make an informed decision about what is actually inscribed at each point” in a manuscript, 
                            although of course editorial “judgment is necessarily involved in deciding what is in fact present”, 
                            “as when an ambiguously formed character resembles two different letters”. Despite these calls on editorial judgment, which must be notated, 
                            in a documentary editorial procedure the resulting “text cannot simultaneously be unemended and emended” 
                            since “no single text” can be both a transcription and a critical text; these “are mutually exclusive genres” of editing, 
                            although the same <i>edition</i> might contain both transcriptions and emended, critical texts 
                            (<a href="/notes/bibliography#VANDERMEULENTANSELLETRANSCRIPTION" target="_self"><span class="persName-">Vander Meulen</span> and <span class="persName-">Tanselle</span>, <span class="title-essay-VANDERMEULENTANSELLETRANSCRIPTION">“System of Manuscript Transcription”</span></a>, 201, 203).</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">For most works in <i>ERM</i>, the editor supplies documentary transcriptions of witnesses paired with facsimiles (if available) of those witnesses. 
                            The archive also provides, as it were, documentary transcriptions of past critical texts of the works, because we believe that researchers will benefit 
                            by being able to study, in close proximity with accurate transcriptions of manuscript witnesses, how <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs first editors 
                            saw fit to represent those manuscripts to readers.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">The editor is responsible for the accuracy of all transcriptions of witnesses in <i>ERM</i>, having taken most of them himself 
                            over several years from the original manuscripts in the Beinecke Library, Yale University; 
                            the Berg Collection, New York Public Library; the Huntington Library; 
                            the Pierpont Morgan Library; Rare Books and Special Collections, Princeton University Library; 
                            the Ruskin Museum, Coniston; and The Ruskin, Lancaster University. 
                            Later, the project acquired facsimiles in the form of high‐resolution tiff files from the the Beinecke Library, which have helped to confirm and improve on 
                            the editorʼs original transcriptions, and which are exhibited in <i>ERM</i>. The editor is also responsible for final decisions 
                            about the interpretation of doubtful readings of manuscripts and for notating these decisions with textual glosses. In scattered instances, mostly involving manuscripts 
                            used to supplement annotation of the works contained in <i>ERM</i>, the editor initially had time in the physical archives 
                            only to describe a manuscript and gather information for a critical apparatus, and not to transcribe its contents completely; 
                            in those cases, we have sometimes been able to capture a transcription based on a high‐resolution facsimile. This procedure is noted where it occurs, 
                            with the expectation of later revisiting the physical manuscript.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">For support of archival research as well as imaging of the manuscripts, the editor and the Digital Humanities program at 
                            Southeastern Louisiana University are indebted to the agencies listed on the 
                            <a href="/webpages/staff" target="_self">Staff and Support</a> page. Without the travel grants and fellowships awarded by these agencies, 
                            the research underpinning <i>ERM</i> would not have been possible. The editor is also grateful to the staffs of these libraries and archives, 
                            who shared their expertise and supported our research.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">In the earliest stage of developing the digital archive beyond the research and writing, <span class="persName-RGARSIDE">Roger Garside</span>, 
                            formerly senior lecturer in the Department of Computing, Lancaster University,
                            devised a helpful program for translating the editorʼs word processing files into lightly TEI‐encoded 
                            <span class="title-program-XML">XML</span>, and for generating transformations in the form of <span class="title-program-HTML">HTML</span> pages. 
                            This program was subsequently replaced as we elaborated our ideas about describing the early <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscripts 
                            with TEI markup, and also as we pursued a pedagogy for introducing students to TEI 
                            encoding and to the craft of designing and building online scholarly resources. <span class="persName-RGARSIDE">Garside</span>ʼs program, however, 
                            was foundational for helping us to envision the architecture of the archive. Meanwhile, to advance the Digital Humanities program at 
                            Southeastern Louisiana University, we benefited from consultation by <span class="persName-SBAUMAN">Syd Bauman</span>, 
                            <span class="persName-MCHRISTY">Matthew Christy</span>, <span class="persName-JFLANDERS">Julia Flanders</span>, <span class="persName-LMANDELL">Laura Mandell</span>, 
                            <span class="persName-DPARKER">Dot Porter</span>, <span class="persName-LWOOF">Lawrence Woof</span>, and the staff of the <span class="date-2005">2005</span> 
                        NINES Summer Workshop in Digital Scholarship at the University of Viriginia. 
                            <i>ERM</i> is indebted to these individuals and their institutions for their generosity and good will, 
                            which has persisted long beyond their respective workshops or consultations that got us started.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">In the ongoing addition of new files to the archive, the following routines are observed by the encoding team. First, using the SyncRO Soft Oxygen XML editor, 
                            encoders pull the word‐processed files of the Editorʼs original transcript(s) of a work, along with files of his apparatus and other annotation, 
                            into appropriate templates built for the varying document types included in <i>ERM</i>. In a first pass, encoders mark up the Editorʼs original 
                            transcription and commentary according to the <span class="title-program-TEIP5">TEI P5</span> standard; and the encoder checks the editorʼs original transcript 
                            against its manuscript facsimile, querying any possible inaccuracies. Team members are instructed to confirm transcription of every deliberate mark on a manuscript, 
                            in whatever hand. The Editor then reviews the transcription and encoding against the facsimile, and he revises and extends the commentary.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">As <span class="persName-DLVM">Vander Meulen</span> and <span class="persName-GTT">Tanselle</span> comment: “Obviously a transcription 
                            cannot exactly reproduce the relative precision or carelessness with which handwritten letters are formed, or their relative sizes, or the amount of space 
                            between words and lines; but it can aim to record every ink or pencil marking of textual significance on the manuscript—all letters, punctuation, superscripts, 
                            canceled matter, lines linking or excising passages, and so on” 
                            (<a href="/notes/bibliography#VANDERMEULENTANSELLETRANSCRIPTION" target="_self">“System of Manuscript Transcription”</a>, 201). 
                            We consider this aim, and nothing less, as defining the standard for first‐pass conversion of the editorʼs original files, 
                            and for checking or completing transcription against its facsimile at this first stage, because it is impractical and an invitation to oversight to reserve some 
                            portion of transcription for a later stage. One can and should review the accuracy and thoroughness of transcription as often as one likes, but no systematic 
                            procedure for dividing a thorough transcription into stages would be practical, since one would have to redefine the procedure constantly in order to address 
                            the peculiarities of each manuscript.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">To maintain consistency of markup in this process, the encoding team references an internal Encoding Guide, compiled by the supervising encoder, 
                            which lists every element, attribute, and value so far employed in the archive, and which is continually updated, as additional <span class="title-program-TEIP5">TEI</span> 
                            elements and attributes or <i>ERM</i> values are discussed and added by the team. The team also constantly references and updates 
                            a project‐based Regularization Crib, which is a <span class="title-program-MSEXCEL">Microsoft Excel</span> spreadsheet listing every 
                            <span class="title-program-XML">XML</span> file name by category—the names, that is, of files in the document‐type categories of 
                            apparatuses, manuscripts, witnesses, anthologies, drawings, essays, notes, and glosses. The Regularization Crib also lists all standardized editorial titles 
                            for these entities; and it serves as the encodersʼ crib for hex‐codes for special characters, <i>ERM</i>ʼs xml:ids for all proper names, 
                            titles, and bibliography entries used in the archive, the names used to identify hands, and dates and date ranges used to mark historical events. 
                            The team (mainly, in this case, the editor and supervising encoder) continually updates the Regularization Cri  as new works, manuscripts, and commentary are added to the archive.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">To manage workflow, , 
                            
                            encoders add their name and responsibility to the header of each <span class="title-program-TEI">TEI</span> file they edit. When ready for review, 
                            the <span class="title-program-XML">XML</span> file is moved (not copied) from the encoderʼs folder and into a reviewerʼs folder, 
                            in order to guard against accidental confusion and overwriting of files. The Editor examines first‐pass encoding for accuracy, consulting both his notes 
                            from on‐site archival research and the facsimile. After the Editor has reviewed a file for accuracy of transcription and markup, along with consistency with the <i>ERM</i> Encoding Guide and Regularization Crib, 
                            it is uploaded for transformation by <span class="title-program-XSLT">XSLT</span> and the resulting HTML checked for errors.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">The team steadily adds new works and manuscripts to the archive, and the Editor constantly researches and develops the commentary 
                            in apparatuses, notes, and glosses in order to increase the usefulness of the archive for researchers. At any given time, hyperlinks to notes are embedded 
                            in the <span class="title-program-XML">XML</span> files that are presently inactive because the source notes are unfinished. 
                            When a source note is completed and added to the archive, any pre‐existing links to it should become active. All files are subject to revision and reloading 
                            with an appropriately updated version number.</div>

                     <div class="p">Because editing in <i>ERM</i> is documentary, we transcribe without correction <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs (remarkably rare) 
                            misspellings and grammatical errors. Also, we retain his capitalizations, ampersands, and unhyphenated spaces in such words such as <i>to day</i>, 
                            <i>every day</i>, <i>every one</i>, and so on. If <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> omits letters from words, 
                            he usually does so to serve poetic meter. Since the reader can in most cases compare the edited transcript against the facsimile, 
                            the cause of an apparent anomaly will be evident (e.g., doubled letters arising from dividing a word between lines, or doubled words occurring before and after page breaks); 
                            nonetheless, potentially confusing anomalies and other distinctive manuscript features receive discussion in a textual gloss. 
                            Some of the most anomalous and challenging markup decisions are presented by the earliest juvenilia, in which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> invented his own

                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs handwriting, like that of any youth, developed over the course of time in terms of manual skill; 
                                and because he was interested in the material presentation of his manuscripts, he adopted a range of copybook scripts from handwriting manuals, and he imitated 
                                various print typefaces, which he found in favorite books printed between the <span class="date-1820-1839">1820s and 1830s</span>.

                                invented a mark to justify right and left margins in fair‐copy prose, which saved him from having to adjust space between words in a line of text. 
                                To fill the gap to the margin, he inserted a horizontal mark of variable length (and sometimes of variable appearance, shaped like an equal sign or a tilde). 
                                Since it would misrepresent the markʼs purpose to encode it according to its appearance in length as a hyphen, en‐dash, or em‐dash,

                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> often indicated paragraph breaks as minimally as possible. Whether because he meant to use space on a page efficiently, 
                                or because he liked the appearance of a more solid block of text, he often failed to indent a word beginning a new paragraph. The intention of a paragraph break 
                                can be signaled, despite the lack of indentation, by a significant gap between the end of a preceding line and the right margin, with no justification mark used 
                                to take up the slack. Sometimes, however, he fills such spaces with stars, like asterisks, and the following line still seems meant as a new paragraph. 
                                Signals become especially confusing when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> ends a block of text with a dash, which serves some rhetorical purpose 
                                such as an excited pause, and which would be indistinguishable from a justification mark apart from white space following it. In <i>ERM</i>, 
                                therefore, we insert paragraph breaks in a text when both sense and some definite scribal feature—such as significant space at the end of a preceding 
                                line, and/or a rare indentation at the start of the next line—seem to call for a new paragraph. If the manuscript evidence is ambiguous, 
                                the editorial decision is marked by a textual gloss.</div>
                        
                        <div class="p">We encode where line breaks fall in prose manuscripts, and we render these as breaks in the <span class="title-program-XSLT">XSLT</span> transformation, 
                                so that prose witnesses match their facsimiles. In poetry, if <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrote an extension of a line as a runover, 
                                the line‐break element 〈lb/〉 is inserted at the start of the runover text within the transcribed line, and the element is assigned a 
                                @type “runover”, thus:<br/>
                           <br/>
                           <span class="center">〈lb type=“runover”/〉〈space quantity=“00” unit=“chars”/〉.</span>
                           <br/></div>
                        
                        <div class="p">Here the 〈space〉 element quantifies the number of characters that the runover is indented from the left text margin. 
                                (In <span class="title-program-XSLT">XSLT</span> transformation, the runover also renders as an interlineation.)</div>
                        
                        <div class="p">In some cases of line runover in poetry, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> also signaled the runover with a mark that, in some places, 
                                resembles an opening square bracket and, in others, a vertical bar. Usually, he placed this mark at the start of the indented runover line. 
                                One can find such a symbol in early nineteenth‐century periodicals using narrow columns, thus causing multiple runovers in printing of poetry; 
                                however, printers appear to have reserved this punctuation to identify a runover that they were obliged to set <i>above</i> its line, 
                                and therefore needed to punctuate in order to distinguish from other runovers in the same poem set as usual below the line, 
                                and without such a mark. Several examples can be found in the <span class="title-periodical-LITERARYGAZETTEBELLESLETTRES"><i>London Literary Gazette, and Journal of Belles Lettres, Arts, Sciences, &c.</i></span>, 
                                which uses the opening square bracket to mark a runover set above its line—typically, a line that simultaneously carries a runover appearing below the preceding line of verse, 
                                and therefore set without the mark 
                                (see, e.g., <a href="/notes/bibliography#ALMOTHERSMORNINGKISS" target="_self"><span class="persName-pen_name-A.L.">A.L.</span>, <span class="title-poem-ALMOTHERSMORNINGKISS">“A Motherʼs Morning Kiss to Her Child”)</span></a>. 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> does not necessarily reserve use of the mark for this specialized class of runovers, 
                                but may apply it indiscriminately to any runover. As an example, see the opening line of 
                                <a href="/witnesses/the_defiance_of_war_msi" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHEDEFIANCEOFWAR">“The Defiance of War”</span></a>, 
                                which is encoded as follows:<br/>

                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> sometimes used a mark to indicate word division at the end of a line. Like his justification mark, 
                                he varied the word‐division sign in length from a mere dot to an em‐dash, and in appearance from a horizontal line to something resembling an equal sign. 
                                All of these marks are interpreted without comment and encoded as a hyphen, since the intention is obvious in both facsimile and transcript. 
                                Sometimes he divided a word without using any mark at all, if his justified right margin did allow the space; in these cases, no mark is encoded and the line break is 
                                represented without comment—the intention again being obvious in facsimile and transcript.</div>
                        
                        <div class="p">One word division mark does call for special treatment, since it appears confusingly redundant. In some cases, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> uses not only 
                                a mark at the right justified margin to denote a break but also at the left justified margin on the line below. Typically, the latter takes a form resembling an equal sign. 
                                When this mark appears at the left margin and is clearly functioning to signal word division, we tag it as a glyph element, @type “word_division”:<br/>

                        <div class="p">In the earliest prose works, dating from <span class="date-1826-1827">1826–27</span>, such as "Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I" 
                                and his first surviving letter written on his own to his father (RFL ??),
                                Ruskin closes sentences with terminal punctuation--periods, question marks, and closing quotation marks--but he typically uses no internal sentence punctuation. 
                                In verse compaosed during the same period, even terminal punctuation is commonly absent, most poems being fair-copied devoid of punctuation, 
                                although some poems contain a single period at the end, as if punctuating the entire poem rather than the end of a sentence. 
                                In the MS I Poetry Anthology (1826-27), only in the final poem, 
                                <a href="/apparatuses/on_the_rainbinow_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-">“On the Rainbow”</span></a>, 
                                contains a significant attempt at punctuation, including commas added at line breaks. The commas appear to represent an afterthought, 
                                since Ruskin squeezed the marks into tight margins using carets, as if added after the lettering was completed.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">Appearances suggesting that Ruskin added punctuation all at once, overlaying pre-existing print lettering, are even more obvious in poems of <span class="date-1827-1828">1827–28</span>. 
                                In the first of two fair copies of "The Constellations" and in the MS III fair copy of "The Monastery", 
                                portions of the poems birstle with punctuation until the markup abruptly and totally stops, suggesting a task distinct from the fair-copy lettering--an 
                                exercise that Ruskin had not learned to make integral to composition of the text. In the poem "The Monastery", for example, 
                                from book one through the middle of book two, almost every line ends with a comma, colon, or semicolon, whether needed or not, 
                                until this excessive punctuation vanishes altogether at the top of a page and is never resumed through book four of the work. 
                                As a contrast, the heavily punctuated book 1 of "The Monastery" is positioned in MS III immediately following an earlier group of poems, 
                                "Poetry Discriptive", dating from when Ruskin typically omitted punctuation in poetry altogether. 
                                The contrast is striking, perhaps indicating that Ruskin was admonished to attend to this deficiency.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">Another sign that, in poems composed in 1827-28, Ruskin added punctuation all at once is the obsessive markup at line breaks. 
                                Because a large proportion of his lines tend to be end-stopped, Ruskin's end-of-line punctuation is commonly grammatical, if superfluous; 
                                however, where enjambment should obviate use of punctuation, Ruskin nevertheless interrupts the sense with a punctuation mark at the line break. 
                                The overall impression is that, in poetry of this period, Ruskin considered punctuation as a feature more decorative than functional. 
                                It may be no accident that punctuation as a decorative feature emerged simultaneously with Ruskin's adoption of pen and ink.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">In transcription, these obsessive but sporadic flurries of punctuation do not necessarily warrant glossing with annoation, except where grammatical misuse is egregious. 
                                Some of Ruskin's difficulty was mechanical: he evidently had trouble writing commas and periods on the baseline, 
                                with the result that the marks float as if the commas were apostrophes or quotation marks. Semicolons are formed upside down, 
                                with the comma-shaped mark placed above the point. In transcription, this kind of awkwardness is normalized, without flagging merely mechanical aberrations 
                                that are best observed in the facsimile. What does warrant glossing is punctuation apparently of Ruskin's own invention; 
                                however, in both poetry and prose of this period, some of his inventions are so baffling that, unlike the justification mark, 
                                they can only be flagged as a glyph, without explanation of their meaning.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p"><i>The double period</i>. Two horizontally adjoined points. This mark first appears at the ends of some sentences in 
                                "Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2". Since their usage appears indistinguishable from that of an ordinary period, 
                                one can only speculate that Ruskin misinterpreted the purpose of an ellipsis, which he saw in books. He may also have imitated 
                                something in an engraved copybook for penmanship, although the copybook by Edmund Butterworth that he is believed to have owned, and which his father acquired in June 1827, 
                                <span class="title-manual_guide-BUTTERWORTHYOUNGARITHMETICIAN"><i>Butterworthʼs Young Arithmeticianʼs Instructor, Containing Specimens of Writing with Directions</i></span> (<span class="date-1815">1815</span>), 
                                contains no such mark, unless one considers the double commas Butterworth uses to divide numerals for pounds, shillings, and pence 
                                (see The Ruskin Family Handwriting: The Ruskins and Copybook Self-Culture). 
                                As another, more fanciful hypothesis for the origin of Ruskin's double period, 
                                one might associate the mark with the colon, which Ruskin began applying around the same time to line breaks in the poems "The Monastery" and "The Constellations". 
                                In the poems, Ruskin used colons in most cases to divide independent clauses, though he also used periods. Perhaps the double period in Ruskin's mind 
                                functioned like a colon, but laid on its side as he deemed appropriate to prose. Coded as a glyph @type “double‐period”</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p"><i>Quotation marks</i>.Two punctuation marks that Ruskin does use functionally, if imperfectly, in these early manuscripts of 1826-28 are apostrophes that define possessives 
                                and ending quotation marks that define speech. Unlike commas, colons, and semicolons that Ruskin appears to have added all at once to a manuscript,
                                apostrophes to mark possessives are integrated into letter-spacing, indicating that he formed them as he fair-copied the text. 
                                Likewise integrated into prose are quotation marks, albeit seemingly randomly alternating between double and single quotation marks, 
                                and always use only at the ends of quotations, never at the openings. Ruskin's usage also suggests confusion over the distinction between direct and indirect discourse.</div>
                        
                        
                        
                        <div class="p"><i>Terminal comma and pause period</i>. In another idiosyncracy of punctuation, occurring throughout the early manuscripts and perhaps related to what <span class="persName-VAB">Van Akin Burd</span> 
                                has characterized in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs mature hand as a <i>half‐comma</i>, 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> inscribed what look like periods in the middle of sentences, 
                                where syntax calls for commas; and conversely, he wrote what look like commas as terminal punctuation at the end of sentences. 
                                This reversal, while not consistent, occurs regularly enough that the marks can be treated as special glyphs. 
                                Thus, the mark is transcribed as the period or comma that its scribal appearance suggests, but the mark is tagged as a glyph, @type “terminal‐comma” 
                                for what appears intended as terminal punctuation, 
                                and @type “pause‐period” for what appears meant to indicate a pause, not a terminus.</div>
                        
                        <div class="p">As found likewise in letters written by all three members of the family, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> sometimes omits terminal punctuation and instead allows extra space

                                on the toolbar (the curved arrow), the reader can view at stage one (indicated on the toggle arrow by its first third being highlighted) 
                                the earliest textual state of a given witness, with text that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> later deleted appearing gray. 
                                At stage two (indicated on the toggle arrow by two‐thirds being highlighted), the reader views the second state of text, 
                                with the added text replacing the deletion. In stage three (indicated by the toggle arrow being fully highlighted), the reader views 
                                deletions and additions simultaneously—that is, the final state of the manuscript witness, as it presently appears—with additions appearing above, 
                                below, or overlapping with the (grayed‐out) deletions, as the case may be.</div>
                        
                        <div class="p">In <i>ERM</i>, addition and deletion is not marked up as a single act, using the substitution element (〈subst〉), 
                                except in cases of overwriting, which cannot be otherwise interpreted. In many instances of deletion followed immediately by a word 
                                that makes sense of the passage, or with such a word placed above or below the line, no other scenario than an immediate substitution seems probable—particularly 
                                if the change is reflected in a subsequent fair copy. But we leave these inferences to the reader, relegating our own interpretations to a textual gloss or the apparatus.</div>

                                one of the poems for the <a href="/apparatuses/msia_apparatus" target="_self">MS IA, g.1</a>, version of

                                uses marginal symbols to instruct the transposition of two lines from one place in the draft to another place—a meaning for the symbols that is confirmed 
                                by his carrying out the transposition in a later fair copy of the poem. We encode <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs symbol for the point of insertion, 
                                an asterisk, with the element 〈metamark〉, with its @function designated in this case as “insertion”; and we encode the lines to be transposed, 
                                which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> brackets in the margin, as a span of text. This is a striking, early instance of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                                using symbols that function in the way defined by <span class="title-program-TEIP5">TEI P5</span> for 〈metamark〉 —to encode a scribal feature in a manuscript that does not form a part of the 
                                work, but that functions as a direction for how to read the text.</div>
                        
                        <div class="p">All metamarks require an editorial gloss to confirm or speculate about their meaning. In general, it seems, the earlier a possible metamark, the more ambiguous its intention, 
                                and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> is more likely to use a word rather than a symbol. In <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, 
                                in <a href="/apparatuses/the_storm_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHESTORM">“The storm”</span></a>, 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> inscribed a word, <i>bad</i>, which might be tagged as a 〈metamark〉, but its @function and @target 
                                could not be specified with certainty. That <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intended the word as metadiscourse seems evident in its isolation, placed on the same line 
                                as a runover text without its forming a part of that runover in sense or grammar. We can speculate that he intended this negative judgment as a directive to reject the poem's strophe 
                                and replace it with another that follows; however, in this and any such ambiguous instance, we can only encode the word or symbol as a 〈metamark〉 
                                without confidently supplying a @function or @target. Rather, we can only discuss a possible function and target in a textual gloss and/or 
                                (as in the case of <span class="title-poem-JRTHESTORM">“The storm”</span>) propose a meaning that is worked out in the apparatus for the poem. 
                                Any such apparent metadiscursive interjection in a work, the function of which is unclear—such as the ejaculations, “Play” and “arretez Oh arretez,”

                                    <a href="#DEFINING">Defining <i>Works</i> and <i>Manuscripts</i></a>), which is typically a commentary 
                                    on another work or a corpus, inscribed directly on the manuscript witness of that work or corpus, and often written by some agent other than the author 
                                    of the original work or corpus. As works, these sorts of glosses are represented by their own apparatus and witness. An example is

                        <li>Encoded as a @type of 〈note〉, a gloss is editorial commentary. It is this kind of gloss with which the present discussion is concerned, 
                                    since these glosses supply necessary clarifications of editorial procedure and extensions of markup. They are further subdivided into two kinds:
                                    
                           <ul>

                     <div class="p">The editor's explanatory and textual glosses are localized to annotating transcripts of specific works, as compared with the form of commentary 
                                called <i>notes</i>, which are free‐standing and hyperlinked throughout the archive.
                                (see <a href="/notes/plan_of_archive_note" target="_self">Plan of the Archive</a>). As the term implies, 
                                explanatory glosses contextualize specific passages in a work—too specific to be annotated with a 〈note〉 that would be 
                                accessible by hyperlink througout the edition. A textual gloss draws attention a specific textual or bibliographical feature of a witness.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Explanatory and textual glosses are accessed through clickable callouts embedded directly in the text. The callouts appear in a different color than 
                                that of the surrounding text; and explanatory gloss callouts are sequenced in arabic numerals, while textual gloss callouts are sequenced by lowercase letters.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">While it is typically recommended in print editions that such annotations be referenced by line number in order to maintain a clear text, 
                                without the clutter of note callouts (see, e.g., 
                                <a href="/notes/bibliography#KLINEPERDUEDOCUMENTARY" target="_self">Kline and Perdue, <i>Guide to Documentary Editing</i></a>, 117), 
                                two factors render embedded callouts more practical in <i>ERM</i>. First, because the archive preserves the separate integrity of multiple witnesses 
                                of a work, a gloss must be capable of hyperlinking to the same or similar string of characters found in more than one witness, 
                                without regard to differences between witnesses in line numbering. Second, because the archive preserves the evidence of 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs own line numbering, which he applied to some witnesses, annotation callouts need to work independently 
                                that numbering, which is often confused or erroneous.</div>
