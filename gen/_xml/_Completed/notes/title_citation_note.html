               <h1 class="page-title">The System of Title Citation for Works</h1>
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs practice of writing a given title in manuscript is explained in the “Title” section of each Works Apparatus Page and can be observed
                    in the facsimile of the manuscript, if available (see <a href="/notes/plan_of_archive_note" target="_self">The Plan of the Archive</a>). But
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs practices of entitling texts are so inconsistent that the reader would be confused by routine citation of literally transcribed titles.
                    For example, because in some instances <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> capitalized important words in titles but in other instances did not, the latter would, when cited out of
                    context, be indistinguishable from first‐line citations; and at the same time, first‐line citation is necessary for texts that otherwise have no titles.
                    Therefore, for purposes of routine citation throughout the <i>Early Ruskin Manuscripts</i>, each text is assigned a regularized title according
                    to the following set of conventions.
                    
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs own titles for poetry and prose are distinguished by quotation marks. First and important words are capitalized, and
                            spelling regularized, regardless of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs own practice. Generally, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs complete titles are given, except when
                            very long titles prove impractical for routine purposes of hyperlinking; and in those cases, some reasonable short form is substituted, such as
                            <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1"><b>“Harry and Lucy,” Vol. 1</b></span> replacing (were the rule being followed strictly) 
                            <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1"><b>“Harry and Lucy Concluded, Being the Last Part of Early Lessons, in Four Volumes, Vol. 1, with Copper Plates, Printed and Composed by a Little Boy and Also Drawn”.</b></span></li>
                     
                     <li>Untitled poems are cited by their first lines, which are likewise placed in quotation marks, but with only the first word and proper nouns capitalized.</li>
                     
                     <li>When <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> assigned more than one and differing titles to witnesses of the same work, rule no. 1 applies, and the separate titles are joined by
                            <i>and</i>, thus: <b>“The Shipwreck” <i>and</i> “A Shipwreck”.</b>  Hyperlinks to such works are, however, for
                            convenience, named by only one of these joined titles—the link taking the reader to the “Title” section of the Works Apparatus Page of the work in
                            question, where the complexity is fully explained.</li>
                     
                     <li>When <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> assigned the same title to different works (e.g. there are more than one poem named
                            “A Fragment”; more than one named “A Psalm”), rule no. 1 applies, and the titles (if of poems)
                            are followed by first‐line citations in parentheses, following the conventions in rule no. 2.</li>
                     
                     <li>When rules 1–4 fail to establish clarity in particular instances, square brackets are used following the main title to supply
                            the necessary distinctions. For example:
                            
                        <ul>
                           
                           <li>Titles that were invented by later editors (e.g., by <a href="/notes/collingwood_w_g_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span></a> 
                                    in <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS4D1891"><i>Poems</i></span> [<span class="date-1891">1891</span>]) are cited inside square brackets following <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs title, with quotation marks and with first and important words
                                    capitalized. The use of square brackets for this purpose was established by <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> 
                                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS4D1891" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS4D1891"><i>Poems</i></span> [4<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>]</a>, 1: xxv; 
                                    <a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS8D1891" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS8D1891"><i>Poems</i></span> [8<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>]</a>, 1: xii), 
                                    and the editors of the <a href="/notes/library_edition_note" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span></a> 
                                    followed suit (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 2: xxxvi). 
                                    Both editions, however, proved inconsistent in maintaining this practice.</li>
                           
                           <li>Works that share the same or similar titles but that cannot be distinguished by citation of a first line (e.g., because they
                                    are not poems) are given distinguishing information in square brackets. For example, prose works with similar titles, such as
                                    “A Sermon,” are followed by the opening words of the text in square brackets, thus: 
                                    <b>“A Sermon” [“beautiful allegory”]</b>. Similarly, drawings with similar titles
                                    are expanded with distinguishing information in square brackets, thus: 
                                    <b>“Frontispiece” <i>and</i> [Plate] “1,” [<span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1"><i>“Harry and Lucy,” Vol. 1</i></span>]</b>.</li>
                           
                           <li>A date in square brackets following the main title distinguishes between works that share a common title <i>and</i> 
                                    a common first line, yet are not necessarily witnesses of the same work (e.g., <b><span class="title-poem-JRTHESHIP1827">“The Ship”</span> [<span class="date-1827">1827</span>] and <span class="title-poem-JRTHESHIP182829">“The Ship”</span> [<span class="date-1828-1829">1828–29</span>]</b>).</li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>
                     
                     <li>When <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> assigned no title but a first‐line citation is impractical or impossible—for example, in the case of a prose work, 
                            or in the case of a long poem that lacks a main title but that consists of multiple parts, each part carrying its own title or needing to be cited
                            by the first line—these works are given titles without quotation marks, and with first and important words capitalized. For example:
                            <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR"><b>Account of a Tour of the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span></b></span>. Where possible, these descriptive titles are drawn from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs habitual way of referring to
                            the works, albeit not on the manuscript itself (e.g., in his letters, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> refers to the “Mineralogical Dictionary” although no such
                            title appears on the manuscript of that work). Another kind of example calling for this kind of descriptive title is a poem that has been all but
                            obliterated, rendering illegible both <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs own title (if any existed) along with the first line that might have served by rule no. 2. For example: 
                            <b>Poem on Mr. Rowbotham</b>.
                        </li>
                     
                     <li>The preceding rules apply also to titles of groups.</li>
                     </ul>
