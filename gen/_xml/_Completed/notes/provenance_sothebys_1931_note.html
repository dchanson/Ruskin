               <div class="p">On <span class="date-1931-05-18">18 May 1931</span>, Sotheby & Co. held a second sale of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs literary remains, 
                    ten months following on the first, the <a href="/notes/provenance_sothebys_1930_note" target="_self">Sothebyʼs Sale of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> Manuscripts and Library, <span class="date-1930">1930</span></a>. 
                    As described in the title of the <span class="date-1931">1931</span> catalogue, the sale represented 
                    <a href="/notes/bibliography#SOTHEBYCAT1931" target="_self"><span class="title-catalogue-SOTHEBYCAT1931"><i>The Final Portion of the Manuscripts & Library of <span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span>,

                        Removed from <span class="placeName-building-9WARWICKSQ">9, Warwick Square</span>, S.W.</i></span>. The auction also included a

                    On balance, the <span class="date-1930">1930</span> sale had been the more significant of the two Sothebyʼs sales of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscripts, 
                    but the <span class="date-1931">1931</span> sale is important to <i>ERM</i> for the continuing dispersal of early manuscripts.</div>

                  <div class="p">The catalogue for the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> portion of the sale is subdivided into two sections: (1) “Books and Manuscripts 
                        (Principally from the Collection of John Ruskin), the Property of the Late <span class="persName-AS">Joseph Arthur Palliser Severn</span>, Esq., 
                        removed from <span class="placeName-building-9WARWICKSQ">9, Warwick Square</span>, S.W.”; and 
                        (2) “The Final Portion of the Manuscripts and Library of <span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span>,

                        which is about to be offered for sale”. The latter, advertised as the “final portion”, was therefore a continuation of the

                        as opposed to the sale of items conceived as belonging the Severns, removed the their town residence, though some of those items originated in the <span class="placeName-building-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span> library.

                        as well as some “Drawings by <span class="persName-CKG">Kate Greenaway</span>”—the latter, though a small group compared to the <span class="persName-CKG">Greenaway</span> lots disposed of in the <span class="date-1930">1930</span> sale, 
                        deemed deserving of a representative plate in the catalogue, 
                        just as the <span class="title-archive-GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">Greenaway collection</span> had featured prominently in the <span class="date-1930">1930</span> sale

                     <div class="p">The catalogue was not only handsomely designed and printed, and generously illustrated with reproductions of drawings, photographs, and manuscripts; 
                            it was also a worthy scholarly achievement. The <span class="date-1931">1931</span>

                            described the lots sketchily and in briefest terms, making no effort to reference <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs 
                            <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">“Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems”</span>—a 
                            basic scholarly responsibility that the <span class="date-1930">1930</span> catalogue had observed. Many of the items in lots 27–30 were miscellanies of manuscripts, assembled and bound in red buckram 
                            in the course of <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>ʼs labor on the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>. The <span class="title-catalogue-SOTHEBYCAT1931">Sothebyʼs catalogue</span> described these compilations by citing a few titles of individual manuscripts apparently at random. 
                            In <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCAT"><span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>ʼs catalogue</span>, by contrast, while the red‐buckram‐bound compilations are maintained in their integrity 
                            as they had come from <span class="placeName-building-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span>, each of the items contained therein are separately and accurately described with their respective titles, 
                            dates of composition, number of pages, medium, and in some cases dimensions. Many of the itemsʼ descriptions are enhanced, moreover, with sample transcriptions 
                            from a manuscript, or with substantial quotations from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs works to contextualize the item. While <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> must have found the time for such meticulous care 
                            because sales were slow—the Depression had begun, and interest in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had been waning even before the financial collapse (see 
                            <a href="/notes/goodspeed_charles_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-CG">Charles E. Goodspeed</span></a>)—the 
                            dealer far exceeded his basic responsibility and lavished his extensive understanding of and affection for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs work on the catalogue.</div>

                            which include the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> draft fragments of <a href="/apparatuses/monastery_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span></a>. The latter item is illustrated by 23 lines of verse, which <span class="persName-JR">Goodspeed</span> would have to have transcribed himself, 
                            and contextualized with the relevant passage in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span> describing how <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> read <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span> during boyhood travels to <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>

                            The enthusiasm for these early manuscripts carried over to <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>ʼs memoir: although his wide‐ranging acquisitions from the <span class="date-1931">1931</span> sale take up more than ten pages 
                            of description in his catalogue, his account of the sale in <span class="title-book-GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><i>Yankee Bookseller</i></span> focuses on only “two examples of early writings in prose and verse”—namely, 
                            two other pieces from the “four very early MSs”, the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> version of

                            “written when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was eight years old”; and the

                            described (as in the catalogue) using <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs ironic remarks in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span> about his boyhood proclivity for deploying such treatises by way of courtship 
                            (<a href="/notes/bibliography#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER" target="_self"><span class="title-book-GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><i>Yankee Bookseller</i></span></a>, 267–68).</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">A decade later, <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> would again recommend the “particular interest” of the <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“Monastery”</span> manuscript, since,

                            and the university libraries of Harvard and Yale [which] are rich in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> materials”. Now Princeton also could show “reason to be proud 
                            of its share of the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> treasures now in <span class="placeName-USA">America</span>”. Not only did acquisitions of significant manuscripts by prominent writers contribute to Princetonʼs standing 
                            (see <a href="/notes/provenance_american_research_libraries_note" target="_self">Ruskin Collecting by American Research Libraries in the Twentieth Century</a>); 
                            for faculty like <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span>, who was teaching Victorian literature at the time, such collections also provided necessary opportunities for serious undergraduate and graduate research, especially if rich in scope and variety like the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> purchase from <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>. 
                            <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span> considered “most enheartening” how “students have moved in and taken over” the special collections department of the library, 
                            taking their place “among the elder scholars”, and “hunched over some rare edition and absorbed in creating a thesis or report” on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> or some other topic

                     <div class="p">While these items had lingered unsold in <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>ʼs catalogue for eight years after their initial purchase, 
                            it was fortunate for Princeton that this ready‐made substantial and representative collection of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> remained available 
                            when the library found itself in a position to buy. In <span class="date-1930">1930</span>, when news broke of the first Sothebyʼs sale of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, 
                            Yale University Library had arrived at a fortuitous, if hectic moment, when the library was preparing to move into the nearly completed <span class="placeName-building-STERLINGMEM">Sterling Memorial Building</span>—a Gothic cathedral among American libraries, if not quite a Ruskinian one. Among its carefully purpose‐designed facilities was a rare book reading and storage space, appointed to the care 
                            of <a href="/notes/tinker_c_b_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-CBT">Chauncey Brewster Tinker</span> (<span class="date-1876-1963">1876–1963</span>)</a>, 
                            professor of English and now also keeper of rare books. <span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span> was a tireless advocate for collection building; and thanks to his friendship with the book collector

                            of a comprehensive collection of published <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, which presented a strong case for extending the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> holdings with manuscript materials. 
                            Princeton University Library, meanwhile, lagged far behind other Ivy League institutions in library facilities and collections. Nonetheless, <span class="date-1930">1930</span> was a significant year for Princeton to begin organizing future efforts, 
                            since in that year the Friends of Princeton University Library was founded, which proved crucial to raising the status 
                            of Princetonʼs special collections (<a href="/notes/bibliography#AXTELLMAKINGOFPUL" target="_self"><span class="persName-JAXTELL">Axtell</span>, <span class="title-essay-AXTELLMAKINGOFPUL">“The Making of the Princeton University Library”</span></a>, 513).

                            At this time, Yale did acquire a manuscript of <span class="title-book-JRPROSERPINA"><i>Proserpina</i></span>, which complemented its manuscript materials related to that work that Yale

                     <div class="p"><span class="persName-CBHOGAN">Hogan</span>ʼs bibliographical article mentions some holdings by Yale, which cause confusion because seeming to overlap 
                            with Princetonʼs <span class="date-1939">1939</span> acquisitions, but they are distinct. One is “a long sketch on the subject of Infant Baptism, which was later elaborated into the 
                            <i>Essay on Baptism</i>” 
                            (<a href="/notes/bibliography#YALECOLLECTION" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-YALECOLLECTION">“The Yale Collection of the Manuscripts of John Ruskin”</span></a>, 64). 
                            This is a draft of the essay contained in the “Architectural Note Book”, <span class="date-1850-1851">1850–51</span>, acquired from <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> in <span class="date-1930">1930</span> 
                            (see <a href="/notes/provenance_sothebys_1930_note#YALE" target="_self">Sothebyʼs Sale of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> Manuscripts and Library, <span class="date-1930">1930</span>: <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, the <span class="date-1930">1930</span> Acquisitions, and Yale University Library</a>). 
                            It is distinct from the 39‐folio page holograph of the essay, bound in red buckram, which <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> sold to Princeton.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">A second, more puzzling overlapping pair of acquisitions is Princetonʼs and Yaleʼs holdings of manuscript and proofs related to 
                            <span class="title-book-JRSTORMCLOUD"><i>The Storm Cloud of the Nineteenth Century</i></span>. 
                            The Princeton holding clearly corresponds to <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>ʼs catalogue description of the “MS. and proof sheets of the principal part of the work in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs autograph, 
                            comprising 43 folio pp. (with 3 pp. in the hand of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs cousin, <span class="persName-JSAR">Mrs. Severn</span>), bound in red cloth”

                            It is disconcerting, therefore, that <span class="persName-CBHOGAN">Hogan</span> notes the Yale <span class="title-book-JRSTORMCLOUD"><i>Storm Cloud</i></span> bound item of manuscript and proofs as having been 
                            “sold at Sothebyʼs on <span class="date-1931-05-18">May 18, 1931</span>” and brought “to Yale by purchase from Mr. <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>”  
                            (<a href="/notes/bibliography#YALECOLLECTION" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-YALECOLLECTION">“The Yale Collection of the Manuscripts of John Ruskin”</span></a>, 67 n. 4). 
                            The <span class="placeName-building-BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke Library</span> does presently own the item to which <span class="persName-CBHOGAN">Hogan</span> was apparently referring, but it is quite different from Princetonʼs. The <span class="placeName-building-BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke</span> record describes: 
                            “Wrappers and separate title pages for each lecture bound in; wrapper for 1st lecture bound in before general t.p. 32 cm. Binderʼs stamp: Bound by Zaehnsdorf. Bound with mounted corrected proof (7 leaves) for pages 48–63, and approximately 14 pages of manuscript additions. 
                            These are inserted after Part I of the printed text”. This description corresponds to an item in the “Quotation” from the <span class="date-1931">1931</span> sale that <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> provided to Yale: 
                            “‘<span class="title-book-JRSTORMCLOUD">Storm Cloud of 19th Century</span>’. Galleys with corrections. Fourteen pp. in authorʼs ms”. The description is also consistent with <span class="persName-CBHOGAN">Hogan</span>ʼs less precise description, 
                            “part of the manuscript and some proof”. According to Sara Powell, research librarian at the <span class="placeName-building-BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke</span>, this item has not heretofore been easily locatable in the <span class="placeName-building-BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke</span>ʼs catalogue, 
                            because classified as a printed work (BEIN Ruskin +884ta) rather than as a manuscript (email communication to <span class="persName-DCH">David C. Hanson</span>, <span class="date-2019-11-19">19 November 2019</span>). 
                            What remains baffling are the respective provenances of of the Yale and Princeton holdings. It seems clear that, 
                            since the description of a <span class="title-book-JRSTORMCLOUD"><i>Storm Cloud</i></span> item in <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>ʼs “Quotation” for Yale closely corresponds to the current <span class="placeName-building-BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke</span> description, 
                            and since <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> offered his <span class="date-1931">1931</span> Sothebyʼs acquisitions to Yale eight years before selling to Princeton, 
                            the provenance of the Yale <span class="title-book-JRSTORMCLOUD"><i>Storm Cloud</i></span> bound manuscript and proofs can reasonably be traced to the <span class="date-1931">1931</span> Sothebyʼs auction. 
                            The original description in the <span class="date-1931">1931</span> <a href="/notes/bibliography#SOTHEBYCAT1931" target="_self">Sotheby & Co., <span class="title-catalogue-SOTHEBYCAT1931"><i>Catalogue</i></span></a>, 
                            is unhelpfully vague: “<span class="title-book-JRSTORMCLOUD">Storm Cloud of the XIX Century</span>. Corrected proofs with long autograph additions, <span class="date-1884">1884</span>” (lot 29, item V [p. 7]). 
                            The characterization of the manuscript portion as “additions”, however, appears to line up with the descriptions in <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>ʼs “Quotation” and in the current <span class="placeName-building-BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke</span> catalogue. 
                            Unless the Princeton <span class="title-book-JRSTORMCLOUD"><i>Storm Cloud</i></span> item also formed part of the original Sothebyʼs <span class="date-1931">1931</span> lot, therefore, its provenance prior to <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>ʼs possession is in doubt. 
                            Yet this tentative conclusion is unsettled by the itemsʼ respective bindings. The Yale item is encased in a decorated Zaehnsdorf binding, 
                            whereas the Sothebyʼs <span class="date-1931">1931</span> catalogue description of lot 29 ascribes “folio cloth” bindings to each of its items. The <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> <span class="title-book-JRSTORMCLOUD"><i>Storm Cloud</i></span> catalogue item 
                            is likewise described as bound in “red cloth”—the binding that was typically used for the <span class="placeName-building-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span> manuscripts
