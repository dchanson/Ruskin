                    which occupied his creative energy for about a year following the familyʼs return in <span class="date-1833-08-19">August 1833</span> (see <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus#DATE" target="_self"><span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>: Date</a>).

                        The <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> illustrations should be understood less as records of a tour than as imitations of the visual media developed for travel publications in the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>, 
                    which allowed British readers to consume Continental scenery at home and as preparation for traveling abroad (see

                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself makes this distinction in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, when reviewing his <span class="date-1833">1833</span> drawings. On the one hand, tour sketches evolved from “flying scrawls” captured “on the road”, 
                    from which he “made, when staying in towns, some elaborate pencil and pen outlines, 
                    of which perhaps half‐a‐dozen are worth register and preservation. My fatherʼs pride in a <a href="#DRAWINGS1833DIJON">study of the doubly‐towered Renaissance church of <span class="placeName-DIJON">Dijon</span></a> was great. 
                        A still more laborious <a href="#DRAWINGS1833HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPML"><span class="placeName-building-HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELS">Hôtel de Ville of Brussels</span></a> remains with it at <span class="placeName-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span>”. 
                        Yet, however worked up at a later time, these tour drawings are distinct from illustrations produced for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> project, in which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> explored the ekphrastic relation of text and the printed image. 
                        “The <a href="#DRAWINGS1833HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPROUT">drawing of that <span class="placeName-building-HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELS">Hôtel de Ville</span></a> by me now at <span class="placeName-OXFORD">Oxford</span>”, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> goes on to explain in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, 
                    “is a copy of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>ʼs, which I made in illustration of the volume in which I wrote the beginning of a rhymed history of the tour”

                  <div class="p">The method of capturing passing scenes for elaboration at a later time, as described in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, does appear to be broadly supported by the evidence of the drawings themselves. 
                        A slight architectural sketch on the <a href="#DRAWINGS1833SIXVIEWS"><span class="title-artwork-JRSIXVIEWS"><i>Sheet of Six Swiss and Italian Views</i></span></a> might be credibly interpreted as a “flying scrawl”, 
                        but the other five drawings on the sheet, which are careful pen‐and‐ink outlines of landscape vistas, would have required a stop along the road, for which the Ruskins had no leisure. 
                        According to <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>ʼs diary for <span class="date-1833-06-13">June 13</span>, for example, the family “[r]ose at 5, breakfasted, and left immediately to cross the <span class="geogName-SPLUGEN">Splugen</span>, one of the wildest and most beautiful passes of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>”. 
                        Surely they would not have risked breaking pace during this dayʼs journey, which ended at 7:00 p.m. on the other side of the mountain at <span class="placeName-CHIAVENNA">Chiavenna</span>, 
                        in order to allow <span class="persName-JR">John</span> time to devise and outline <a href="#DRAWINGS1833SIXVIEWS-SPLUGEN">“On the road to <span class="placeName-SPLUGENVILLAGE">Splugen</span>”</a> and 
                        <a href="#DRAWINGS1833SIXVIEWS-TUSIS">“On the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> near <span class="placeName-THUSIS">Tusis</span>”</a>. 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> must have designed these vistas later, just as <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> would have required the quiet of a hotel to compose her diary entries, which exactingly incorporate guidebook information 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFT48" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-RFT48">Diary of <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span></span>, <span class="date-1833">1833</span></a>, 40–41). In fact, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs five vistas on the sheet can be interpreted specifically as a retrospective. Already formed into oval vignettes, their lines overlap and interlock at the edges, 
                        as if to form a retrospective panorama, which advances from crossing the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> into <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>,

                        The sheet constitutes a kind of moving picture.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">If the description in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span> of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs sketching routine is generally confirmed by the evidence, 
                        it should also be qualified and supplemented by remarks in <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>ʼs diary. 
                        On the one hand, <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>ʼs mention of an hour of sketching at <span class="placeName-CASSEL">Cassel</span> proves that the outcome of that session, the surviving drawing (indeed, 
                        a “laborious” one) of <a href="#DRAWINGS1833CASSEL"><span class="title-artwork-JRHOTELDEVILLECASSEL"><i><span class="placeName-building-HOTELDEVILLECASSEL">Hotel de Ville, <span class="placeName-CASSEL">Cassel</span></span></i></span></a>, 
                        cannot have been completed on the spot in that time. On the other hand, <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span> 
                        neglects the fact that <span class="persName-JR">John</span> and <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> spent that hour at <span class="placeName-CASSEL">Cassel</span> sketching together. 
                        They also drew side by side at <span class="placeName-ANDERNACH">Andernach</span>, where <span class="persName-JR">John</span> began his <a href="#DRAWINGS1833ANDERNACH"><span class="title-artwork-JRWATCHTOWERATANDERNACH"><i>Watch‐tower at <span class="placeName-ANDERNACH">Andernach</span></i></span></a>, 
                        and again at <span class="placeName-COBLENZ">Koblenz</span>, where <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>ʼs skill may even have gained her an upper hand (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFT48" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-RFT48">Diary of <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span></span>, <span class="date-1833">1833</span></a>, 4, 22, 23; and for further discussion of

                  <div class="p">It was perhaps more typical for <span class="persName-JR">John</span> to sketch by himself; however, <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>ʼs summary of his practice, as jotting down “flying scrawls on the road” 
                        to be worked up into finished drawings “when staying in towns”, also overlooks his on‐site sketching while <i>in</i> 
                        the towns. Very early in the tour, <span class="persName-JR">John</span> established a routine of leaving the hotel under the protection of the familyʼs courier, <span class="persName-SALVADOR">Salvador</span>, to sketch for an hour after breakfast, 
                        and again for an hour or two between dinner, taken around 3 p.m., and tea, taken around 6:00 or 6:30. 
                        At these times, the rest of the family would be taking a walk or shopping 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFT48" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-RFT48">Diary of <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span></span>, <span class="date-1833">1833</span></a>, e.g. 5, 6, 7, 12). 
                        First mentioned at <span class="placeName-TOURNAI">Tournai</span>, where <span class="persName-JR">John</span> went out to sketch the cathedral, this routine eventually drops out of the diary—not, one conjectures, 
                        because <span class="persName-JR">John</span> abandoned the practice, but because it became too common to be worth noticing, whereas <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> found greater interest in describing tourist sites in dense detail. 
                        It is also possible, however, that the elder Ruskins grew wary of the environs of <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs sketching sessions, especially in larger cities, and reined in these excursions, even though accompanied by <span class="persName-SALVADOR">Salvador</span>.

                    is probably the same drawing that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> exhibited at the <span class="title-exhibition-FINEARTSOCIETYRUSKINSTURNERS1878">Fine Art Society (<span class="date-1878">1878</span>)</span>. 
                    In the catalogue for that exhibition, <span class="title-catalogue-JRNOTESONMYOWNDRAWINGS1878">“Notes on My Own Drawings and Engravings”</span>, 
                    he describes the drawing as a copy after <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>, and not as an on‐the‐site tour sketch 
                    (in <span class="title-catalogue-JRNOTESBYMRRUSKIN1878"><i>Notes by <span class="persName-JR">Mr. Ruskin</span> on His Drawings by the Late <span class="persName-JMWT">J. M. W. Turner, R.A.</span></i></span>

                    The latter drawing appears to be <a href="#DRAWINGS1833HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPROUT"><span class="title-artwork-JRHOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPROUT"><i><span class="placeName-building-HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELS">Hôtel de Ville</span>, <span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span>, after <span class="persName-SP">Samuel Prout</span></i></span></a>,

                    It would be logical to associate this drawing with the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>, which presents a blank gap above the header for the section,

                    however, this <span class="placeName-LANCASTER">Lancaster</span> drawing is too large to have been tipped into the gap in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>. A drawing that may have been intended for that space,

                     <div class="p">Such ambiguities seem particularly to beset the cataloguing of drawings from the <span class="date-1833">1833</span> tour, because of their near relation to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs production of illustrations for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> in <span class="date-1833-1834">1833–34</span>. 
                    Yet despite the subsequent difficulty in untangling the provenance of similarly described and entitled drawings, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> maintained a steady distinction—both 
                    in the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span> when producing the drawings, and in the <span class="date-1870-1889">1870s–80s</span> when exhibiting them—between 
                    his tour sketching and his imitation of illustrated travel literature. In the case of the <span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span> <span class="placeName-building-HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELS">Hôtel de Ville</span> drawings, 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> appears to have imitated <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>ʼs drawing in stages, first copying the lithograph on a scale appropriate to the large original, 
                    and then reducing that copy to the scale appropriate to a steel‐engraved vignette.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">Another source of obscurity in distinguishing the tour sketches from the illustrations for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> may lie, not only with an inability to identify a catalogued work and trace it to its current location, 
                        but also with errors or duplications in the cataloguing itself. For example, according to the <span class="title-catalogue-CATALOGUEOFRUSKINSDRAWINGSLE">“Catalogue of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs Drawings”</span>

                            asserts an understanding of the process and outcome of “re‐drawing” a view from nature in order to shape an artifact of print culture, a “sheet of vignettes”. 
                            Just so, in the case of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="placeName-building-HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELS">Brussels Hôtel de Ville</span> drawings, 
                            <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs <span class="title-catalogue-WGCRUSKINEXHIBITION1900">catalogue</span> description of item no. 10 in the <span class="title-exhibition-RUSKINEXHIBITIONCONISTON1900">Coniston Exhibition</span> claims 
                            that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="title-artwork-JRHOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPROUTCOPY">“copy”</span> of a <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span> lithograph “reduced [the original] to miniature scale” to make a vignette. 
                            In contrast, the title of no. 898 in the <span class="title-catalogue-CATALOGUEOFRUSKINSDRAWINGSLE">Library Edition catalogue</span>,

                            suggests uncertainty about the distinction between a “sketch” and a “vignette”. Perhaps by <span class="date-1912">1912</span>, 
                            when the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE_BIBLIOGRAPHY"><i>Bibliography</i> volume of the Library Edition</span> was published, 
                            the editors had become less prone to square particular drawings and manuscripts with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs autobiographical narratives 
                            about how one should view the productions of his boyhood. For example, in a drawing now held by the <span class="placeName-BOSTON">Boston</span> Museum of Fine Arts, 
                            <a href="DRAWINGS1833SIXVIEWS"><span class="title-artwork-JRSIXVIEWS"><i>Sheet of Six Swiss and Italian Views</i></span></a> 
                            (and one wonders if this piece could be identified with the untraced <a href="#DRAWINGS1833SHEETOFVIGNETTES"><span class="title-artwork-JRVIGNETTESFROMSKETCHESINNORTHITALY"><i>Sheet of Vignettes, Re‐drawn from Sketches in N. <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span></i></span></a> or the

                            If <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> meant that the sketch represented his first attempt at recording a historical monument during the tour of <span class="date-1833">1833</span>, he was mistaken.

A drawing of <span class="placeName-building-STRADEGUNESABBEY">St. Radegundʼs</span> survives

                    Sketches served as the basis for vignette illustrations, a process documented in the evolution of <a href="/figures/balstall_drawing_msix" target="_self"><span class="title-artwork-JRBALSTALLMSIX">Vignette after “Ancient Fortress and Rocky peak / Above the vale of <span class="placeName-BALSTHAL">Balstall</span>”</span></a>; 
                    and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> planned additional such adaptations of his tour sketches, as he noted in the

                    Moreover, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs creation of the tour sketches themselves cannot be separated entirely from the visual culture of travel‐related publications that he more explicitly imitated

                            instead valuing signs of an incipient keenness in observing nature. In <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, 
                            he singles out only “half‐a‐dozen” <span class="date-1833">1833</span> drawings as “worth register and preservation” for their observable landscape truth. 
                            For example, in the <span class="date-1878">1878</span> <span class="title-exhibition-FINEARTSOCIETYRUSKINSTURNERS1878">Fine Art Society exhibition of his own drawings</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> showed an <span class="date-1833">1833</span> drawing or group of drawings described as “a dayʼs sketching . . . between <span class="placeName-ARONA">Arona</span> and <span class="placeName-DOMODOSSOLA">Domo dʼOssola</span> on the same journey”, 
                    which, though “finished out of my head” at some later time, documented attention to real landscapes. This work, which came to be catalogued as 
                            <a href="#DRAWINGS1833MAGGIOREANDDOMODOSSOLA"><span class="title-artwork-JRLAGOMAGGIOREANDDOMODOSSOLA1833"><i><span class="geogName-LAKEMAGGIORE">Lago Maggiore</span> and <span class="placeName-DOMODOSSOLA">Domo dʼOssola</span></i></span></a>, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> considered “interesting” for its “proper economy of paper” and “weak enthusiasm”—qualities that he may have connected with his youthful engagement with print culture. 
                            What prompted him to exhibit the work in <span class="date-1878">1878</span>, however, was its evidence of “fastening so early” on a landscape truth that he would illustrate over two decades later 
                            in a drawing called <span class="title-artwork-JRROCKOFARONA"><i>The Rock of <span class="placeName-ARONA">Arona</span></i></span> made for <span class="title-book-JRMODERNPAINTERS4"><i>Modern Painters IV</i></span>. 
                            In the <span class="title-book-JRMODERNPAINTERS4"><i>Modern Painters</i></span> volume, this drawing occurs among the chapters on “Sculpture of Mountains” 
                            to illustrate a discussion of rocky precipices. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> traces the “real rock lines” that follow a “parabolic flow” in overhanging rock forms, arguing that, in nature, 
                            these parabolic lines trace a “delicate overhanging” that becomes “cautiously diminished as [the precipice] gets higher”. In contrast, 
                            <span class="persName-CLAUDE">Claude Lorrain</span> and Renaissance painters were “fond of representing . . . overhanging of rocks with buildings on the top, 
                            and weeds drooping into the air over the edge, always thinking to get sublimity by exaggerating the projection” of their fantastically beetling precipices

                     <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs later emphasis on truth‐to‐nature has influenced critics in their approach to the early tour sketches, which typically consists in sifting bona fide factual observations from the chaff of conventionality. 
                    <span class="persName-PHW">Paul H. Walton</span>, for example, singles out bits of “observation” amid the “timid drawing style, limited at this time by eighteenth‐century conventions”

                            Yet <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs youthful observations of nature were themselves prompted by the visual and print culture of his decade. Whatever adumbration of <span class="title-book-JRMODERNPAINTERS4"><i>Modern Painters IV</i></span> 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> later found in his sketches in <span class="placeName-ARONA">Arona</span>, his observation may have been directed by <span class="persName-WBI">William Brockedon</span>ʼs

                            In <span class="persName-WBI">Brockedon</span>ʼs plate, <span class="title-artwork-"><i><span class="geogName-LAKEMAGGIORE">Lago Maggiore</span></i></span>, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> planned to copy

                    the viewer finds “the overhanging precipice beneath which the route of the <span class="geogName-SIMPLON">Simplon</span> passes to <span class="placeName-ARONA">Arona</span>”; as commented in the accompanying text, 
                    “it is difficult to pass” beneath this precipice “without feeling an emotion of danger”

                    “The Pass of the <span class="geogName-SIMPLON">Simplon</span>”, 17, 18). The emotion is not forced by exaggerating the landscape features, which are peaceful in <span class="persName-WBI">Brockedon</span>ʼs plate; 
                            the only bizarre element is injected by art, rather than nature—the <span class="title-artwork-CERANOSANCARLONE">colossal statue of <span class="persName-CBORROMEO">St. Carlo Borromeo</span></span>, 
                    which extends a blessing over the hills. Even this presence is omitted in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem for this section, 
                            which erases the statue but keeps the word “colossally”, 
                    applying it to the surrounding moutains, “spirits of gigantic things / Lords of the earth and air and sky”

                            Also in the emotion of <span class="persName-WBI">Brockedon</span>ʼs illustrated travelogue, as well as in the Ruskinsʼ experience of travel, lay the realization of recent history: 
                            atop the precipice above <span class="placeName-ARONA">Arona</span> stood the <span class="placeName-building-ROCCADIARONA">Rocca di Arona</span>, an ancient fortress owned by the Borromeo family, in <span class="date-1800">1800</span> reduced to a ruin by <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span>ʼs army.</div>

                    Before the Ruskins departed for the <span class="placeName-EUROPE">Continent</span>, a part of this scene was already vivid to them from <span class="persName-SP">Samuel Prout</span>ʼs lithograph,

                            For the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> planned, but apparently never carried through with copying some portion of this lithograph to illustrate the section, 
                            <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus#account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_pcs_corpus_ehrenbreitstein" target="_self"><span class="title-composite-JREHRENBREITSTEINCOMP">“<span class="geogName-EHRENBREITSTEIN">Ehrenbreitstein</span>”</span></a>

                            Instead, the buildings in <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>ʼs picturesque scene form part of a different kind of drawing that 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> made in <span class="placeName-KOBLENZ">Koblenz</span>—a panorama of the medieval buildings of <span class="placeName-COBLENZ">Koblenz</span> viewed from across the <span class="geogName-MOSELLE">Moselle River</span>.</div>

                            Lithography, as a means of reproduction, offered an intimate connection with the artist, since the medium “multiplied originals” drawn on the stone 
                            by the artist himself, without the intermediary of an engraver. Although in fact successful artistic lithography required codependency 
                            between the artist and the printer, and artists developed specialized lithographic techniques that emulated other forms of printmaking, 
                            the medium persuasively suggested direct connection between the artist and the viewer—particularly so in the case of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>ʼs

                            which was marketed directly by the artist through subscription, with copies distributed by members of his own family

                            Panorama, in contrast, was public spectacle, produced by teams of artists. The grandest was

                            to a vignette was better suited for use in the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> than was the panorama‐inspired

                            which could not be scaled down at all and remain the kind of representation it is. It is jarring, therefore, to see the buildings in <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>ʼs picturesque lithograph 
                            stationed at the left end of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs line of facades along the <span class="geogName-MOSELLE">Moselle</span>, 
                            drawn in spare outline rather than in <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>ʼs crumbly textures. <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>ʼs subject,

                            and the Romanesque <span class="placeName-building-FLORINSKIRCHEKOBLENZ">Florinskirche</span>, anchor the left end of the panorama, while,

                            recognizable by its baroque Welschen hoods capping the towers. On the right end, the panorama is framed by the <span class="date-1201-1300">thirteenth‐century</span> <span class="placeName-building-ALTEBURG">Alte Burg (Old Castle)</span>,

                            which connects to the castle at a right angle to the plane of the picture, spanning the <span class="geogName-MOSELLE">Moselle</span>. 
                            The drawing seems to eschew the artistic personality of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>ʼs <span class="title-artwork-PROUTSKETCHES"><i>Facsimiles</i></span> or <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>ʼs vignettes for <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, and to substitute an objective overview of the medieval center of the town.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">At the same time, the circumstances in which the drawing was made can be interpreted as domesticating its spectacular viewpoint. 
                            <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span> noted in her diary that, after dining immediately 
                            on arrival in <span class="placeName-COBLENZ">Koblenz</span>, “<span class="persName-JR">John</span>

                            while “Uncle and Aunt ascended a little hill from whence they had a fine view”. The childrenʼs view‐seeking was more ambitious: 
                            their hotel, the <span class="placeName-building-CHEVALBLANC">Cheval Blanc</span>, stood on the east bank of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>, the <span class="geogName-EHRENBREITSTEIN">Ehrenbreitstein</span> side, meaning that, to reach the viewpoint 
                            shown in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs drawing, they had to cross “both the bridges”—the pontoon bridge across the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> 
                            from the <span class="placeName-EHRENBREITSTEINVILLAGE">village of Ehrenbreitstein</span> to the old city of <span class="placeName-KOBLENZ">Koblenz</span>; 
                            and then the stone bridge, <span class="placeName-building-BALDWINBRIDGE">Balduinbrücke</span>, across the <span class="geogName-MOSELLE">Moselle</span> from the old town. 
                            Like this brave excursion, the panoramic drawing suggests the boldness of the older cousin, and perhaps her instruction or participation, 
                            since <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs drawing rather strenuously applies linear perspective. This teaching was a specialty of the drawing tutor,

                                The exhibition of these drawings in the decade after <span class="date-1900">1900</span> doubtless testifies to the popularity of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs autobiography, <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>,

                    these <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth‐century</span> reproductions preserved the originalsʼ dimensions. If so, the <span class="placeName-ANDERNACH">Andernach</span> drawing must have been a tour drawing, 
                    since, as reproduced, its dimensions would have been too large to have served as a vignette illustration in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>. 
                    In contrast, the size and shape of the <span class="placeName-INTERLAKEN">Interlaken</span> (<span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span>) drawing, as shown in reproduction, 
                    suggest that the original was intended as a vignette illustration, probably destined for the uncompleted section

                     <div class="p">It is ironic that the originals of these photogravures vanished in a process of reproduction that, in <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span>ʼs characterization, was driven by a desire for authenticity. 
                    According to his <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPREFATORYNOTESPLATES">“Prefatory Notes on the Plates”</span> in the <a href="/notes/poems_1891_note" target="_self"><span class="date-1891">1891</span> edition of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS4D1891"><i>Poems</i></span></a>, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> along with the “publisher, 
                    engravers, and printers” was motivated by an “anxiety . . . that the plates should represent the original drawings as accurately as modern skill permits”. As a foil, 
                    <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> characterizes the “old standard art” of engraving used to illustrate <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs earlier books as a “joint” project of designer and engraver, like 
                    “concerted music” performed by “players on different instruments”. An authentic solo performance by the designer was not reproducible on a mass scale; “it was never . . . 
                    [the artist and engraverʼs] intention to give the style and touch of the draughtsman, his separate individuality, his momentary mood, as shown in the very material and handling 
                    of the original sketch”. But now with the invention “of modern photographic engraving”, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> believed, 
                    this authentic individuality had come within reach of reproducibility. He regarded photogravure as an attempt “to reproduce the master, 
                    to <i>facsimile</i> the authentic document”. This faith in photographic reproduction aligned with <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs biographically 
                    oriented editorial aims: “this is what we want here in such pictures as rightly illustrate a collection of Poems written in Youth, 
                    in bygone historic times, recording a famous manʼs childhood and boyhood, his first impressions and fresh ideas of the world and of life”. Photographic engraving promises to supply 
                    “genuine records of the traditional precocity which we should like to verify: some true measure of the progress which we suspect, but cannnot otherwise trace, by which genius was developed. 
                    We want to see <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs drawings, and not engraverʼs plates” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS4D1891" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS4D1891"><i>Poems</i></span> [4<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>]</a>, 1:v).</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">In the <a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS4D1891" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891">1891 <i>Poems</i></span></a> (large‐paper edition only, the octavo edition containing no plates), the <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPREFATORYNOTESPLATES">“Prefatory Notes on the Plates”</span> complements the <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">“Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems”</span>, 
                    but the former was placed at the front of volume one, and the latter at its end, presumably because the physical witnesses of the photogravure plates were regarded as the closest possible encounter 
                    with the actuality of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs youth. Comparatively, the edited and printed poems placed the material manuscripts at a step removed, mediated by the editor, although some compensation 
                    was afforded by photogravure reproduction of samples of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs early handwriting, as well. <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> admits that “no reproduction can be quite the same thing as an original, if the original 
                    owe any of its interest to the more subtle artistic qualities of line and tone”. The benefit of photogravure, in <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs mind, lay in its “mechanical reproduction by a method which, 
                    clever and charming as it is, adds nothing to . . . [the sketchesʼ] cleverness and charm”—the mechanization assuring that what was conveyed was at least purely authentic, however deficient otherwise.
                    <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> evidently perceived no significant contradiction between this faith in mechanization and his admission that “Messrs. Walker and Boutallʼs photogravures” were “helped by <span class="persName-GA">Mr. George Allen</span>ʼs retouching” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS4D1891" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS4D1891"><i>Poems</i></span> [4<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>]</a>, 1:vi). 
                    But what seemed comparatively to liberate reproduction of an artifact from human intervention in the <span class="date-1890-1899">1890s</span> now seems quaintly like handicraft. 
                    From a <span class="date-2001-2100">twenty‐first century</span> perspective, the early stage of “photogravure was a hand process”; 
                    the skill incorporated the <span class="date-1701-1800">eighteenth‐century</span> technique of aquatint, and “early attempts to print photographs in ink 
                    often included efforts to retain . . . [the] capacity to manipulate the image” through “intrusions of handwork”
