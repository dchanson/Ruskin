               <div class="p">Since the largest holdings of early <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscripts ended up the <span class="placeName-USA">United States</span>, 
                    this note discusses institutional factors that may have influenced collecting of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                    in general, and of the early <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in particular, by American research and university libraries.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">An indirect factor was the influence of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs ideas over the architecture of American university campuses. 
                    The built environment reflected American aspirations about higher education and evolving ideas about the place of the library in campus life. 
                    While these aspirations did not necessarily favor collecting <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> over other canonical writers, 
                    some special impetus may have arisen from interest in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs educational as well as aesthetic ideals. 
                    Another, less exalted factor among Ivy League university libraries was competition, 
                    with Princeton envying Yaleʼs larger and more impressive holdings, 
                    and both institutions eyeing the vast resources at Harvard. 
                    As the first issue of the newsletter of the Friends of Princeton University Library pointedly reminded its readers in <span class="date-1930">1930</span>, 
                    Harvard University Library was “vigorously furthering her effort to improve what . . . 
                    ranked already as fifth in order of size among the worldʼs collections of books” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#PAREDITORIALFPUL" target="_self"><span class="persName-PAR">Rollins</span>, <span class="title-essay-PAREDITORIALFPUL">editorial</span></a>, 1). 
                    Rivalry was specifically invoked as justification for Princetonʼs first major acquisistion of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscripts 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#THORPRUSKINMANUSCRIPTS" target="_self"><span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span>, <span class="title-essay-THORPRUSKINMANUSCRIPTS">“The Ruskin Manuscripts”</span></a>, 2).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Rare‐book departments of university libraries absorbed the tastes and interests of their individual 
                    donors. The generation of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collectors in America represented by

                    was guided by the phenomenon of <a href="/notes/collecting_of_modern_authors_note" target="_self">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</a>. 
                    In following this trend, collectors aspired to acquire every printed item in its original published state that was produced by the modern author of the collectorʼs choice—a comprehensive collection from juvenilia to last words. 
                    Thus, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collectors searched for the authorʼs poems as first published in the <a href="/notes/annuals_note" target="_self">annuals</a>, 
                    and especially as collected in the prized <a href="/notes/poems_1850_note" target="_self"><i>Poems</i> (1850)</a>. Some collectors were also able to extend their comprehensive print collections 
                    with various states of manuscript production such as marked proofs and touched engravings, as well as with letters and drawings. 
                    Juvenile manuscripts were inaccessible to collectors, however, until the opportunity to enhance the scope of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscript and graphic holdings was exponentially raised by the estate dispersal sales in <span class="date-1930-1931">1930–31</span>, with the

                    The chief American buyer at these sales was the <span class="placeName-BOSTON">Boston</span> rare‐book dealer, 
                    <a href="/notes/goodspeed_charles_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-CG">Charles E. Goodspeed</span></a>, 
                    who sold in turn to Yale University Library and to Princeton University Library.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> meanwhile had built his personal collection of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>. 
                    The collection was primarily print, “its scope . . . enlarged to include all the authorized editions of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and his biographies” 
                    comprising “more than five hundred volumes”, but also including drawings, letters, and other materials. <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> donated the collection to Wellesley College in <span class="date-1920-1921">1920–21</span>, 
                    “principally in consideration of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs interest in the education of girls” 
                    and because his own daughters had graduated from Wellesley (<a href="/notes/bibliography#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER" target="_self"><span class="title-book-GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><i>Yankee Bookseller</i></span></a>, 265). 
                    <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> continued adding to the collection throughout the <span class="date-1920-1940">1920s through 1940s</span>.</div>

                     <div class="p">At Yale University between the World Wars, collecting of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and of much else was driven by

                            who advocated for building the libraryʼs special collections and encouraged their use by graduate students. <span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span> generously opened his personal rare book 
                            and manuscript collection to studentsʼ use and persuaded his friend and fellow collector 
                            <a href="/notes/adam_r_b_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-RBA">R. B. Adam II</span></a> to do the same. 
                            While <span class="persName-RBA">Adam</span>ʼs collection was devoted primarily to <span class="persName-SJ">Samuel Johnson</span> and his circle, he inherited a <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collection from his father, which he built 
                            into one of the most comprehensive print collections of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in <span class="placeName-USA">America</span>. <span class="persName-RBA">Adam</span> donated his <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collection largely intact to Yale University Library in <span class="date-1929">1929</span>. 
                            One year later, Yale took the opportunity to complement <span class="persName-RBA">Adam</span>ʼs bequest with acquisitions from the

                            Through the agency of <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> and perhaps others, the sale afforded Yale 
                            with a range of manuscripts that was representative both of the chronology and diversity of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs career (see

                     <div class="p">In <span class="date-1930">1930</span>, acquisition of a <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscript collection by Yale Library formed a timely complement 
                            not only to the <span class="title-archive-RBARUSKINCOLLECTION">Adam Collection</span> but also to the libraryʼs new home, 
                            the <span class="placeName-building-STERLINGMEM">Sterling Memorial Building</span>. Designed in a Gothic Revival style, 
                            the <span class="placeName-building-STERLINGMEM">Sterling</span> would inevitably have brought <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs 
                            ideas to mind, though the building was also very modern. The structure wraps a Gothic cathedral‐ and cloister‐like shell, 
                            which houses the reading and circulation spaces, around a setback skyscraper tower, containing the stacks and technical operations. 
                            In context of this project, a research collection of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was probably considered appropriate, but not vital, 
                            to discussion about architectural style at Yale.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">The time was past when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs ideas were realized directly in designs for Yaleʼs campus buildings. 
                            Ruskinian Gothic flourished from <span class="date-1864">1864</span>, with <span class="persName-PBW">P. B. Wight</span>ʼs (<span class="date-1838-1925">1838–1925</span>) design for the Street Fine Arts Building, 
                            through the mid‐1880s, with <span class="persName-RSTURGIS">Russell Sturgis</span>ʼs (<span class="date-1836-1909">1836–1909</span>) work on Battell Chapel and other buildings. 
                            These men were <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> enthusiasts, and their understanding of his architectural and social ideas found supporters among the faculty 
                            (<a href="/notes/bibliography#LYNNBUILDINGYALE" target="_self"><span class="persName-CLYNN">Lynn</span>, “Building Yale and Razing It from the Civil War to the Great Depression”</a>, 110–18). 
                            But by the <span class="date-1920-1939">1920s–30s</span>, Victorian thinking about architecture was being displaced by Bauhaus. 
                            Gothic Revival did persist in Yaleʼs campus development, just as “collegiate Gothic” thrived on American campuses elsewhere, 
                            and teachers like <span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span>, who edited <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, must have directed students to the criticʼs theories. Nonetheless, it is questionable 
                            whether <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs ideas retained the force of an ideology for architects of American universities. 
                            According to <span class="persName-PGOLDBERGER">Paul Goldberger</span>, the designer of the <span class="placeName-building-STERLINGMEM">Sterling Memorial Library</span>, 
                            <span class="persName-JGR">James Gamble Rogers</span> (<span class="date-1867-1947">1867–1947</span>), was not prone to defend either its neo‐Gothic design or its skyscraper functionality on ideological grounds. 
                            <span class="persName-JGR">Rogers</span>ʼs buildings, <span class="persName-PGOLDBERGER">Goldberger</span> believes, did not aspire to “the same kind of moral authority 
                            that <span class="persName-AWNP">[Augustus Welby] Puginʼs</span> or <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs Gothic possessed in the <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth century</span>” 
                            and that <span class="persName-PBW">Wight</span>ʼs and <span class="persName-RSTURGIS">Sturgis</span>ʼs campus buildings had articulated for Yale a half‐century earlier; <span class="persName-JGR">Rogers</span> sought, rather, 
                            “to provide pleasure for the eye along with a casual, undemanding association with the past” 
                            (<a href="/notes/bibliography#GOLDBERGERROGERS" target="_self">“James Gamble Rogers and the Shaping of Yale in the Twentieth Century”</a>, 272).</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">At the same time, the <span class="placeName-building-STERLINGMEM">Sterling building</span> epitomized what one historian has characterized as the “golden age” of the American university library (<span class="date-1890-1940">1890–1940</span>), 
                            when free‐standing, architecturally imposing library buildings were erected at the geographical and intellectual heart of the university campus. 
                            Earlier, in the colonial era, college libraries occupied a single room in a multipurpose building; and then in the nineteenth century, 
                            larger colleges such as Yale constructed dedicated library buildings—in either neoclassical or (modeled on the English universities) Gothic Revival styles—which 
                            sat on the edge of campus and functioned more as glorified book repositories than as circulating libraries. Starting in the late nineteenth century, 
                            with the erection of vast and imposing library buildings, situated at the center of a revised campus plan, a new message was conveyed: 
                            “educators considered these structures to be ennobling, uplifting students by providing them with opportunities for cultural improvement, 
                            whether by studying library books or the building that housed the books” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#GYUREHEARTOFTHEUNIVERSITY" target="_self"><span class="persName-DAGYURE">Gyure</span>, “The Heart of the University”</a>, passim and 119). 
                            The architectural rhetoric mixed overwhelming cultural authority with individualistic aspiration and enfranchisement—values 
                            that are combined in a challenging and disconcerting fashion in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs lectures about books and reading, <span class="title-book-JRSESAME"><i>Sesame and Lilies</i></span> (<span class="date-1865">1865</span>). 
                            During the golden age of American university library building, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs book servied as a universal school prize—small presentation volumes, 
                            which were tricked out as decoratively within their means as the ornate buildings to which the prizes were meant to direct the grateful recipient.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">While <span class="persName-JGR">James Gamble Rogers</span> may have been no ideologue according to <span class="persName-PGOLDBERGER">Goldberger</span>, 
                            he did contend for maintaining “religion, or at least a version of it, at the Yale center”, according to another architectural historian; 
                            like other campus planners and library architects of his period, <span class="persName-JGR">Rogers</span> proposed “creating a new kind of sacred space for the modern American university—a 
                            cathedral library laden with quasi‐religious iconography”. Not only did the <span class="placeName-building-STERLINGMEM">Sterling</span>ʼs structural plan encase 
                            “the functions of a modern library within the shell of a neo‐Gothic cathedral”; the buildingʼs elaborate decoration scheme of Gothic detail 
                            encompassed an extensive iconographic program, which was perceived as important enough to sacrifice 
                            “six tiers of book stacks in order to fund more ornament” in stone and wood carving, glass and mural painting, and other media

                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs books on architecture were well‐known primers for reading iconographic programs, although the <span class="placeName-building-STERLINGMEM">Sterling</span>ʼs scheme

                            and was teaching Victorian poetry at the time.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">For Princeton, however, the cachet of acquiring a <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collection 
                            at this juncture was probably even less significant ideologically than it had been for Yale, 
                            since the pressing architectural problems were functional rather than aesthetic. Princeton already possessed a Ruskinian‐influenced library building, 
                            the <span class="placeName-building-CHANCELLORGREENLIB">Chancellor Green Library</span> (<span class="date-1872">1872</span>), designed in the Venetian polychromatic Gothic style 
                            by <span class="persName-WAP">William Appleton Potter</span> (<span class="date-1842-1909">1842–1909</span>). The buildingʼs octagonal plan—centered on a panopticon‐like reference desk, 
                            which was encircled by radiating shelves and reading desks—was responsive to librariansʼ thinking of the time, 
                            that services should be “tri‐partitioned” into staff services, secure stacks, and patron reading areas. 
                            This facility was rapidly outgrown, so the <span class="placeName-building-CHANCELLORGREENLIB">Chancellor Green</span> was extended in <span class="date-1897">1897</span>, by being joined to the new <span class="placeName-building-PYNELIBRARY">Pyne Library</span>—a 
                            more practical rectangular building, designed by <span class="persName-WAP">Potter</span> in “collegiate” Tudor Gothic

                     <div class="p">Even the combined <span class="placeName-building-CHANCELLORGREENLIB">Chancellor Green</span> and <span class="placeName-building-PYNELIBRARY">Pyne</span> buildings soon reached capacity, despite what was regarded as an embarrassingly modest pace of growth, 
                            compared to the mammoth collections held by Yale and Harvard. Moreover, the buildings were not designed to accommodate the flexibility and increased usage demanded 
                            by the pedagogical innovations that <span class="persName-">Woodrow Wilson</span> introduced as president of the university in <span class="date-1905">1905</span>—the preceptorial method of instruction—and 
                            that were further developed in <span class="date-1923">1923</span> as the “Four‐Course” plan, which stressed independent and wide‐ranging reading. 
                            In <span class="date-1930">1930</span>, when Yale Library was moving to the new <span class="placeName-building-STERLINGMEM">Sterling Building</span>, Princeton took an important step toward addressing these limitations 
                            by organizing the Friends of Princeton University Library. While the Friends organization was at heart devoted more 
                            to amassing a competitive rare books and manuscript collection for the library than to advocating for brick‐and‐mortar issues, 
                            they nonetheless gravitated to a natural alliance with the bookish humanities and social sciences faculty, since, as <span class="persName-JAXTELL">James Axtell</span> remarks, 
                            they expected their donations to be well cared for and used in an up‐to‐date special collections facility, 
                            as opposed to the dank storage and paltry exhibition space allowed by the <span class="placeName-building-PYNELIBRARY">Pyne</span>

                     <div class="p">The alignment of these forces is reflected in the funding for the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> purchase from <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>,
