               <div class="p"><span class="persName-CG">Charles Eliot Goodspeed</span> was significant both as a personal collector of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and as a seller to other <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collectors, 
                    operating from his shop in <span class="placeName-BOSTON">Boston, Massachusetts</span>, first opened in <span class="date-1898">1898</span> (<a href="/notes/bibliography#WHITEHILLGOODSPEED" target="_self"><span class="persName-">Whitehill</span>, <span class="title-dictionary_entry-WHITEHILLGOODSPEED">“Charles Eliot Goodspeed”</span></a>, 261). 
                    In his memoir, <a href="/notes/bibliography#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER" target="_self"><span class="title-book-GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><i>Yankee Bookseller</i></span></a> (<span class="date-1937">1937</span>), <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> dates his <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collecting from his youth in the <span class="date-1880-1889">1880s</span>, 
                    giving two reasons for “the spell of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>”. First, his books occupied, “if not the highest, at least high rank in modern English literature”, 
                    for “although his style is criticised”, he “is conceded to be a great prose writer”. Second, for collectors, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs books presented outstanding 
                    “examples of book‐making”, excelling “principally in illustration” but also in the “minute attention” that the author gave to all aspects 
                    of book‐making in such works as “<span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, <span class="title-book-JRDEUCALION"><i>Deucalion</i></span>, <span class="title-book-JRPROSERPINA"><i>Proserpina</i></span>, and the other books issued [originally] in parts” (pp. 263, 264). 
                    It was perhaps the bibliophileʼs enchantment with the illustrations in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs books that caused <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> to take a special interest in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs own drawings.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs standard for “book‐making” inspired <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> also as a publisher. In the <span class="date-1939">1939</span> edition of 
                    <a href="/notes/bibliography#LEHMANNHAUPTBOOKINAMERICA" target="_self"><span class="title-book-LEHMANNHAUPTBOOKINAMERICA"><i>The Book in America</i></span></a>, 
                    <span class="persName-HLH">Hellmut Lehmann‐Haupt</span> characterized <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> as “a disciple of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, and moved by many interests which he shared with the Stone and Kimball generation” (p. 254), 
                    referring to the small art‐nouveau publishers of the <span class="date-1890-1899">1890s</span>, such as Stone & Kimball in <span class="placeName-CHICAGO">Chicago</span> and 
                    Copeland & Day in <span class="placeName-BOSTON">Boston</span>. These publishers, according to <span class="persName-HLH">Lehmann‐Haupt</span>, “had in common their determination 
                    to publish only works of literary quality and to bring out their selections in an attractive and distinctive format” (p. 211). 
                    From the founding of his bookselling business through the early <span class="date-1930-1935">1930s</span>, <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> realized these art‐book ambitions in small publishing projects of his own, 
                    which were printed by the Merrymount Press (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MAHONEYGOODSPEED" target="_self"><span class="persName-MMAHONEY">Mahoney</span>, <span class="title-essay-MAHONEYGOODSPEED">“C.

               <div class="p">The spell of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> for <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> was not confined to bibliographical appeal, however. <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> was a thorough and admiring student of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs ideas, 
                    as demonstrated by the scholarship he brought to a not insignificant bibliographical contribution to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> studies in the <span class="date-1930-1939">1930s</span>, his 
                    <a href="/notes/bibliography#GOODSPEEDCAT" target="_self"><span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCAT"><i>Catalogue of Paintings, Drawings, and Manuscripts by John Ruskin</i></span></a>, 
                    published by Goodspeedʼs Book Shop

                    <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>ʼs approach to thinking through <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> appears to have been primarily biographical. 
                    His most cherished collectorʼs possession was the manuscript of <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>; 
                    and according to a record of a talk he gave at Wellesley College Library in <span class="date-1933">1933</span>, 
                    he chose to interest his listeners in “<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs youth” and “his love in later life for <span class="persName-RLT">Rose La Touche</span>”, 
                    illustrating the talk with “his own collection of early <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drawings and other material illustrative of his life”, 
                    including <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs portrait drawing of <span class="persName-RLT">Rose La Touche</span>, and one of <span class="persName-GR">George Richmond</span>ʼs portrait drawings of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#WELLESLEYPRESREPORT_1932-33" target="_self"><span class="title-periodical-WELLESLEYPRESREPORT_1932-33">Wellesley College, “Annual Reports . . . 1932–33”</span></a>, 42‐43). 
                    In <a href="/notes/bibliography#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER" target="_self"><span class="title-book-GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><i>Yankee Bookseller</i></span></a>, he planned to devote part of the chapter on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> to “the story of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and <span class="persName-RLT">Rose La Touche</span>, prefaced by an account of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs 
                    marriage with <span class="persName-ECG">Euphemia Gray</span>”, ultimately deciding to save the topic for treatment elsewhere (p. 268).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> also took a practical interest in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>. Judging by <span class="persName-WMWHITEHILL">Walter Muir Whitehill</span>ʼs remarks about the hobbies that the bookseller pursued in his retirement years, 
                    <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>ʼs interests appear to have been inspired by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs works, such as tending to rare, wild plant species in his woodland garden 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#WHITEHILLGOODSPEED" target="_self"><span class="title-dictionary_entry-WHITEHILLGOODSPEED">“Charles Eliot Goodspeed”</span></a>, 361). His most regretted loss at the final <span class="placeName-building-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span> estate sale in <span class="date-1931-07">July 1931</span> was <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs 
                    mineral cabinet, an “item [that] excited me greatly, for it revived my early interest in mineralogical specimens, never entirely lost”

                  <div class="p">As one of most prominent <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collectors stateside in the first half of the twentieth century, 
                        <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> exhibited characteristics of the trend for 
                        <a href="/notes/collecting_of_modern_authors_note" target="_self">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</a>, 
                        which committed collectors to assembling comprehensive runs of an authorʼs first editions in their original condition. 
                        In his memoir, <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> comments on his “mistake” as a young collector in causing his fledgling <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collection to be uniformly rebound, 
                        instead of preserving the items in their original state. He therefore disposed of that false start and rebuilt his <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collection 
                        on “the primary rule that pamphlet issues of all kinds, if intended for sale to collectors, 
                        must be preserved in their original form”. Eventually, <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>ʼs <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collection reached over five hundred items 
                        of first editions along with “all the authorized editions of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and his biographies” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER" target="_self"><span class="title-book-GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><i>Yankee Bookseller</i></span></a>, 261–62, 265). 
                        The volume count is comparable in scope with a contemporaneous comprehensive <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collection assembled by the American collector, 
                        <a href="/notes/adam_r_b_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-RBA">R. B. Adam II</span> (<span class="date-1863-1940">1863–1940</span>)</a>

                  <div class="p">As a bookseller, <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> held to the standard of “<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> firsts”, just as he had done as a collector; 
                        and he believed he “bought more” of these editions “abroad than any other American dealer”. As a <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> specialist, 
                        he distinguished his shop from the “larger booksellers”, who could be counted on to stock 
                        “the nine‐volume set comprising <span class="title-book-JRMODERNPAINTERS"><i>Modern Painters</i></span>, <span class="title-book-JRSEVENLAMPS"><i>The Seven Lamps of Architecture</i></span>, and <span class="title-book-JRSTONESOFVENICE"><i>The Stones of Venice</i></span>” 
                        in a uniform size with illustrations—the latter caveats obscuring what the initiated <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collector would have recognized, 
                        that these sets were made up with later editions of <span class="title-book-JRMODERNPAINTERS1"><i>Modern Painters I</i></span> and <span class="title-book-JRMODERNPAINTERS2"><i><i>Modern Painters II</i></i></span> rather than the first editions of those two volumes, 
                        not so much because the firsts were a different size than the other volumes (and in the case of <span class="title-book-JRMODERNPAINTERS1"><i>Modern Painters I</i></span>, lacked illustrations), but because the first editions of those two volumes were extremely rare. 
                        Scouring <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> firsts, <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> says that, other than the prized <span class="title-book-JRMODERNPAINTERS1"><i>Modern Painters</i> I</span> and <span class="title-book-JRMODERNPAINTERS2">II</span> and

                        he “found no competition” for first editions of lesser‐known <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> titles—namely, the dozens of books and pamphlets beyond the titles making up the standard 
                        nine‐volume sets always available “on the shelves of the larger booksellers“ (<a href="/notes/bibliography#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER" target="_self"><span class="title-book-GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><i>Yankee Bookseller</i></span></a>, 262–63).</div>

                        for the “mild local interest in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> then prevalent” in the first third of the twentieth century, 
                        and he believed his own “earnestness” contributed to upholding the “fading <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> tradition” at least in New England. 
                        (He hoped that the chapter on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in his memoir would “arouse a new interest in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, at least with collectors”, 
                        when the author had become so “strangely neglected today”). While he knew the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collector <span class="persName-RBA">R. B. Adam</span> only by reputation, not as a client, 
                        <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> supplied other important American collectors, including

                        felt able to assure their other major <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> client, <span class="persName-JHW">J. H. Whitehouse</span>, that the firm could work with mutual advantage for both <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> and <span class="persName-JHW">Whitehouse</span>. 
                        See <span class="title-letter-b_f_stevens_to_j_h_whitehouse_1931-07-17"><span class="persName-RBROWN">Ralph Brown</span>ʼs <span class="date-1931-07-17">17 July 1931</span> letter to <span class="persName-JHW">Whitehouse</span></span>, quoted in 
                        <a href="/notes/bibliography#DEARDENRUSKINBB" target="_self"><span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span>, <span class="title-book-DEARDENRUSKINBB"><i><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, Bembridge, and <span class="placeName-building-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span></i></span></a>, 88.) 
                        It seems likely, however, that, although avoiding squaring off against competitors like <span class="persName-JHW">Whitehouse</span> who targeted the more canonical 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscripts, <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> took on considerable risk. Not only had the Great Depression begun in <span class="placeName-USA">America</span>, 
                        but, even before the crash, interest in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was declining, as <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> later admitted in <span class="title-book-GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><i>Yankee Bookseller</i></span>. 
                        The decline was evident by <span class="date-1929">1929</span> even before <span class="date-1929-10-29">Black Tuesday</span>, since by that date <span class="persName-RBA">R. B. Adam</span> had already donated his <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collection to Yale, 
                        after having unsuccessfully attempted for the previous six years to sell the collection through the major <span class="placeName-NEWYORK">New York</span> dealer, <span class="persName-ASWR">A. S. W. Rosenbach</span> 
                        (see <a href="/notes/adam_r_b_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-RBA">R. B. Adam II</span> [<span class="date-1863-1940">1863–1940</span>]</a>).</div>

                        offered first chance at these items to Yale, but the library purchased only two items
                        (see <a href="/notes/provenance_sothebys_1931_note#YALE1931" target="_self">Sothebyʼs Sale of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> Manuscripts and Library: <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, the <span class="date-1931">1931</span> Acquisitions, and Yale University Library</a>.

                        which must have entailed a significant expense in itself. One recipient of the catalogue in 1932 was <span class="persName-JHW">J. H. Whitehouse</span>, 
                        whom <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> hoped to interest especially in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drawings, though <span class="persName-JHW">Whitehouse</span> 
                        is believed to have delayed acquiring a group of these drawings until <span class="date-1936">1936</span> (<a href="/notes/bibliography#DEARDENRUSKINBB" target="_self"><span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span>, <span class="title-book-DEARDENRUSKINBB"><i><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, Bembridge, and <span class="placeName-building-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span></i></span></a>, 138–39). 
                        In <span class="title-book-GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><i>Yankee Bookseller</i></span>, published in <span class="date-1937">1937</span>, <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>ʼs

                        must have been prompted by the slowing sales of his Sothebyʼs acquisitions. Not until <span class="date-1939">1939</span> were many of the items in <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>ʼs

                        Salvaging viable remains of books and manuscripts from the catastrophe, <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> donated 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscripts to Yale University Library in the hope that they could be preserved in spite of damage. 
                        He chose the <span class="placeName-building-STERLINGMEM">Sterling Library because</span> “it was his wish to complete Yaleʼs holdings of the available major <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscripts,

                  <div class="p">The first of these gifts, sent soon after the fire in <span class="date-1941-03">March 1941</span>, was the manuscript of <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>,

                        As he had boasted before the fire in <span class="title-book-GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><i>Yankee Bookseller</i></span>, it was “for the manuscript of <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span> 
                        that I have most regard. I had bought . . . [the autobiography] when published in periodical form, looking forward to each succeeding number 
                        with a keener interest than the modern reader would have for the weekly installment of a story by <span class="persName-ACHRISTIE">Agatha Christie</span> 
                        in the <span class="title-periodical-SATURDAYEVENINGPOST"><i>Saturday Evening Post</i></span>. . . . I cannot imagine a temptation sufficent to make me part with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs portrait of <span class="persName-RLT">Rose La Touche</span> 
                        and his manuscript of <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER" target="_self"><span class="title-book-GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><i>Yankee Bookseller</i></span></a>, 269). When that time of parting did come, 
                        not as a temptation, but as an unthinkable catastrophe, <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> was devastated with remorse. Writing to 
                        <a href="/notes/tinker_c_b_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-CBT">Chauncey B. Tinker</span> (<span class="date-1876-1963">1876–1963</span>)</a>, the keeper of rare books at Yale University Library, 
                        whether he would “care to be bothered with material in such damaged condition”, <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> thought it “fitting that what is left of it should be preserved there. . . . 
                        I myself do not feel like putting it in shape for better preservation. . . . 
                        I hardly need to say how keenly I regret that, as the custodian of a manuscript of this kind, I have been so negligent in properly caring for it. 
                        We think of these things, however, when it is too late”. In a subsequent letter, <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> rejoiced in having recovered more of the manuscript, 
                        but two octavo volumes had perished altogether
