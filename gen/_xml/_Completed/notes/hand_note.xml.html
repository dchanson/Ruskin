                    <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> claims that, in childhood, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                    “developed his own writing like other precocious boys and girls, though there is some trace of teaching at the very start”; 
                    and then later, “after <span class="date-1830">1830</span>, he exchanged, perhaps at the instance of superior orders, his ‘print’ 
                    for copperplate”, imitating his <span class="persName-JJR">father</span>ʼs mercantile round hand with the aid of a copybook

                    Seemingly the most untenable assumption in <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs account is the exclusion of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs mother from any role in his developing handwriting, 
                    by limiting the story to the boyʼs precocity and his fatherʼs masculine mercantile discipline. 
                    Who else but <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> presided over the scenes of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs first handwriting 
                    during <span class="persName-JR">John James</span>ʼs frequent absences on business trips? (See <a href="#CURSIVE"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs Cursive Hand</a>.)</div>

                        a creature in nature starting to use its limbs. On <span class="date-1823-03-15">15 March 1823</span>, when <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> transcribed “exactly word for word” what 
                        the four year old “said was a letter to send to” his father and “pretended to read” for his motherʼs dictation “from his paper” on which he had “been very busy

                        when “learn[ing] himself to write”, evidence of his “copy[ing] from his books” as a possible auto‐didactic practice

                        Throughout the book, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> traced the outlines of the engraved illustrations on the blank reverse of those pages

                        <div class="p">But the <span class="persName-fictional-OLDMANTD">old man</span>, as he was something of a scholar, had a great ambition that his darling
                                    should learn to read and write: and this was a work of some difficulty; for he had neither 
                                    printed book, nor pens, nor paper, in his cabin. Industry, however, enables us to overcome difficulties: 
                                    in the summer‐time, as the <span class="persName-fictional-OLDMANTD">old man</span> sat before his cottage, he would draw letters in the sand, 
                                    and teach <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> to name them singly, until he was acquainted with the whole alphabet. 
                                    He then proceeded to syllables, and after that to words; all which his little pupil learned 
                                    to pronounce with great facility: and, as he had a strong propensity to imitate what he saw, 
                                    he not only acquired the power of reading words, but of tracing all the letters 
                                    which composed them on the sand.</div>

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> can scarcely have relied solely on himself, however, for the <span class="persName-fictional-OLDMANTD">old man</span>ʼs method of progressing from alphabet to syllables to words.

                        could apply either to “metallic” or “wooden” instruments, wooden pencil‐making with superior plumbago had been an established industry in

The cedar pencil of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs youth was probably unvarnished or unpainted (treatments that became popular in mid‐century) and sharpened using a penknife 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#PETROSKIPENCIL" target="_self"><span class="persName-HPETROSKI">Petroski</span>, <span class="title-book-PETROSKIPENCIL"><i>The Pencil</i></span></a>, 69, 126–44). The artistʼs porte‐crayon—a holder for pieces of pure plumbago, chalk, or charcoal, such as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> is shown 
                        holding in <span class="persName-GR">George Richmond</span>ʼs <span class="date-1843">1843</span> watercolor portrait—was associated with children in French <span class="date-1700-1799">eighteenth‐century</span> genre paintings showing boys absorbed in drawing,

                        Such depictions were intended to suggest progressive educational ideas and represented children as thoughtful, individualistic observers

                        For common purposes, however, the French porte‐crayon was replaced by the Conté pencil, developed in the <span class="date-1790-1799">1790s</span> by <span class="persName-NJCONTE">Nicolas‐Jacques Conté</span>, 
                        who devised a method of filling the wooden casing with a blend of graphite and clay, thus stretching and improving supplies of inferior Continental plumbago when war with <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span> cut off access to <span class="placeName-BORROWDALE">Borrowdale</span> graphite

                  <div class="p">In his earliest pencil lettering, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> formed his characters very large  
                        and allowed ample interlinear space—the line spacing owing in part to his following the pre‐ruled lines in the stationerʼs notebooks known in the family as the <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span></a>. 
                        The model for his large (and, by <span class="date-1826">1826</span>, well‐formed) lettering probably lay in the typography of his books—not in a handwriting copybook, which <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> acquired for him in <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, but which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> appears not to have used immediately

                        In the <span class="date-1767-1834">late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries</span>, a precedent for typography in childrenʼs books had been set by

                        in order to make print accessible and legible to a childʼs eyes. As <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span> explains in the preface, 
                        a “great defect” she found in books commonly produced for children was “the want of <i>good paper, a clear and large type</i>, 
                        and <i>large spaces</i>. They only, who have actually taught young children, can be sensible how necessary 
                        these assistances are” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#BARBAULDLESSONS" target="_self"><span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>, <span class="title-book-BARBAULDLESSONS"><i>Lessons for Children</i></span></a>, 3–4; and see <a href="/notes/bibliography#MCCARTHYBARBAULDLESSONS" target="_self"><span class="persName-WMCCARTHY">McCarthy</span>, <span class="title-essay-MCCARTHYBARBAULDLESSONS">“Mother of All Discourses”</span></a>, 200–201).

                        (its four parts were intended for children aged two to four), but he certainly was familiar with <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>ʼs

                        <a href="/apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I”</span></a>, 
                        his adaptation of <span class="persName-ME">Maria Edgeworth</span>ʼs 
                        <a href="/notes/bibliography#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL" target="_self"><span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><i>Frank; A Sequel</i></span></a> and 
                        <a href="/notes/bibliography#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED" target="_self"><span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span></a>, 
                        he imitated the <a href="/notes/edgeworth_harry_and_lucy_concluded_note" target="_self">originalʼs title page</a>; and in the text, he may have modeled his letters on the serif typeface used for <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>ʼs 
                        books, even adopting a decorative capital <i>Y</i> from the display type of the title page. 
                        (The lettering suggests Caslon or perhaps the English transitional serif typefaces, such as Baskerville and Bulmer, 
                        which predominated in British books of the <span class="date-1767-1834">late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries</span>.) Another influential model was the <span class="title-series-DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">“Doveʼs English Classics”</span>, 
                        a reprint series of which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> owned volumes of <span class="persName-APOPE">Pope</span>ʼs translation of the <span class="title-poem-HOMERILIAD"><i>Iliad</i></span> (<span class="date-1824">1824</span>) 
                        and of <span class="persName-JDRYDEN">Dryden</span>ʼs translation of the <span class="title-poem-VIRGILAENEID"><i>Aeneid</i></span> and other works by <span class="persName-VIRGIL">Virgil</span> (<span class="date-1825">1825</span>). 
                        At three by five inches, much smaller than the <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span> volumes, 
                        the <span class="title-series-DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">“Doveʼs English Classics”</span> were comparable in size to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span></a>, 
                        but typographically the text was the opposite of <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>ʼs child‐friendly large and spacious type. 
                        The densely set lines of verse on small pages resulted in many runovers, which the printer/publisher J. F. Dove signaled with a right‐facing square bracket <i>[</i>, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> precisely imitated 
                        when his own poems crowded the margins of his <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span></a> 
                        (see <a href="/notes/boyhood_books_note#DESCRIPTIONS" target="_self">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Physical Descriptions</a>;

                  <div class="p">As another creative solution to problems occasioned  
                        by constraining his lettering within the guidelines of bookmaking, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> invented a punctuatoin mark enabling him to imitate a text block, justified right and left. 
                        Encountering difficulty in managing his letter‐ and word‐spacing so as to end a line of prose on the right‐justified margin, 
                        he filled in the gap with a variable‐length hyphen. Presumably, he based his mark on hyphenation used in print to divide words at the margin, 
                        and he did also employ the hyphen for that purpose. More often, however, he effectively adapted the hyphen as an original punctuation mark, whose varying length enabled him to justify margins. 
                        In <i>ERM</i>, the mark is designated as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <i>justification mark</i> 
                        (see <a href="/notes/editorial_rationale_note#JUSTIFICATION" target="_self">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology: Element, Attribute, and Value Usage—Justification, Runover, and Word Division</a>). 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> continued to use this mark for the purpose of right‐justifying text at least through <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy of 
                        <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">An Account of a Tour of the Continent</span> (<span class="date-1834">1834</span>.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">A particularly obsessive and time‐consuming typographic imitation that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> adopted to ornament his printed lettering 
                        was a decorative capital that he called “double” print. This was formed with a doubled downward or upward stroke, which could be left open or filled wtih shadow. 
                        Examples occur in the earliest fair‐copy manuscripts, both in the <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self">Red Books</a> and in the separate 
                        presentation copies of poems that were later bound in <a href="/apparatuses/msia_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span></a> and 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/msia_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span></a> 
                        (see, e.g., the <span class="date-1827-01-01">1 January 1827</span> pencil presentation copy, <a href="/witnesses/time_blank_verse_msia" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTIMEBLANKVERSE">“Papa whats time a figure or a sense”</span></a>). 
                        Possible models for the “double‐lettering” include a display typeface used on title pages of <span class="title-series-DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">“Doveʼs English Classics”</span> 
                        and a similar engraved lettering used on maps in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs geography book, 
                        <span class="title-book-GOLDSMITHGEOGRAPHY"><i>Geography Illustrated on a Popular Plan</i></span> (<span class="date-1820">1820</span>) by the <span class="persName-RJG">Reverend J. Goldsmith</span>—the 
                        author also of a geography text used by the Brontës 
                        (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 35:79;

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> appears to have derived his double‐lettering primarily from a serif model, 
                        but he may also have based it on the sanserif typefaces that began as a neoclassical revival in the <span class="date-1780-1789">1780s</span> 
                        and sprang into a variety of forms and associations in the first decades of the nineteenth century 
                        (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#CRAMSIEGRAPHIC" target="_self"><span class="persName-PCRAMSIE">Cramsie</span>, <span class="title-book-CRAMSIEGRAPHIC"><i>Story of Graphic Design</i></span></a>, 117–18, 126–27). 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> used these decorative printed letter forms until <span class="date-1828-1829">1828–29</span>, when his lettering for many texts 
                        became notably smaller, though no less typographical in form—the decrease in size perhaps owing to his increasing agility with pen and ink, which he was using by then, but perhaps also to imitating the smaller type in the adult books 
                        he was consuming by then.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Double‐print lettering cost <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> a great deal of time and attention, as in the elaborate fair copy of the poem

                        which he apparently failed to complete in time for a holiday presentation to his father (see

                        The showmanship and consequent difficulties managing his time drew worried comments from his <span class="persName-MR">mother</span>. 
                        In a study of writing instruction in colonial <span class="placeName-USA">America</span>, <span class="persName-EJMONAGHAN">E. Jennifer Monaghan</span> notes the disjunction between the point of the writing masterʼs exercises—which was 
                        focused on “form” and the “purely visual properties” of handwriting, thus requiring the student “to learn 
                        how to represent the words of others” in “a variety of scripts”—and the ultimate purpose of writing instruction, 
                        which was to teach “a child to express himself” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#EJMONAGHANLEARNING" target="_self"><i>Learning to Read and Write in Colonial America</i></a>, 275). 
                        <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> turned the writing masterʼs approach on its head, asking her husband to “excuse” how <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs “showing you” the mechanical skill of “his writing 
                        occupied his thoughts fully more than how he expressed his feelings” (<a href="/apparatuses/mr_to_jjr_1827-04-28_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">Margaret to John James Ruskin, <span class="date-1827-04-28">28 April 1827</span></span></a>

                        From the perspective of the nineteenth‐century child writer, however, what seems a deflection into materiality may have seemed a source of empowerment.

                  <div class="p">The problems caused by obsessive print forms would be solved by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs adopting a more flowing “copperplate” round hand for fair copies of his poems—especially longer poems,

                        Yet <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> continued to take pleasure in decorating his text, the opportunities for fancy calligraphy only increasing with his mastery of pen and ink

                        writers gave “an account of both their own and the adult world”, empowering themselves 
                        to “construct an identity of authorship” chosen in “response to the print culture of their time”

                        provide a reliable guide. In <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> alone, imported goose quills consumed annually averaged around 20 million, 
                        and the country as a whole used about double that number. However, the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span> 
                        also witnessed the mass production of steel pens—referring to what nowadays is typically called the <i>nib</i>, as opposed to the pen‐holder held in the hand—and by <span class="date-1838">1838</span> this output increased to 220 million. In the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>, 
                        manufacturers (chiefly in <span class="placeName-BIRMINGHAM">Birmingham</span>) were improving the flexibility of pens as well producing them in quantities sufficient to lower their retail cost considerably. 
                        Even fountain‐pens were being patented, although not mass‐produced until the end of the century. These alternatives to the traditional quill became more affordable and widely used in the

                        consumers typically were unskilled in mending a quill for extended use, or unwilling to take the trouble, 
                        preferring merely to discard a dull pen for a fresh one. Steel pens broke easily, but as they became cheaper (dropping from about eighteen shillings per dozen at the start of the century

                        as his default hand for rough draft of poetry and prose. An early example is the poem,

                        This manuscript originated as a fair copy of the poem, using an ink, print‐lettered hand similar in appearance to the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> fair copy of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span>, which is dated ca. <span class="date-1827-1828">1827–28</span> (books 1–2). 
                        In the margins, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> revised the poem in a sprawling cursive hand, using both pen and pencil. This version of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span> is undated,

                        which incorporates the revisions. The cursive hand is awkward, but recognizably <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs, and legible without difficulty. 
                        Judging by the pencil cursive hand used for the ca. <span class="date-1829-02-1829-05">February–May 1829</span> rough draft of

                        until <span class="date-1793">1793</span>, shortly before <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> enrolled at that institution in <span class="date-1795">1795</span>.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Apparently, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> regarded this juncture in the development of his sonʼs handwriting as a coming of age, 
                        analogous to his own. When <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> enrolled at the Edinburgh Royal High at age ten, 
                        he was already somewhat older than his class, the customary starting age being eight—<span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs age when first using a pen. 
                        Scottish burgh schools like the Edinburgh Royal High in theory championed a democratic ideal 
                        of seating tradesmenʼs sons alongside those of patricians, and fees were kept moderate. Nonetheless, the Ruskin family 
                        may have delayed in order to scrape together the means even for moderate fees, or <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs mother, <span class="persName-CTWR">Catherine</span>, 
                        may have been apprehensive of exposing him to a famously sadistic Latin master 
                        (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#SCOTTISHHERITAGE" target="_self"><span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span>, <span class="title-book-SCOTTISHHERITAGE"><i>Ruskinʼs Scottish Heritage</i></span></a>, 59–62;

                        Given his own delayed matriculation, whatever its cause, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> perhaps acted with deliberate resolve in introducing his son in <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, at age eight,

                        In an <span class="date-1825">1825</span> advertisement, the publisher Oliver & Boyd of <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span> characterizes

                        as “designed for the Use of Schools and Private Families”, by “combining accurate Writing, correct Figures, and judicious Arrangement”. 
                        Respecting the five productions by <span class="persName-EDB">Butterworth</span> listed, the advertisement goes on to declare that “[f]or beauty of design, and correctness of execution, 
                        these Works of Mr <span class="persName-EDB">Butterworth</span> are admired by every competent judge of Penmanship.

                  <div class="p">As a path to self‐cultivation, copybooks typically provided instructional texts (set in letterpress) along with illustrations of writing samples in various styles or <i>hands</i> 
                        (reproduced from engraving or woodcut and, later, from lithograph). Subcategories of copybooks specialized in particular disciplines or audiences, 
                        such as youths or ladies; and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> may have learned from such a manual at Mrs. Riceʼs Academy for Ladies in <span class="placeName-CROYDON">Croydon</span>, 
                        where she attended as a girl and learned accurate spelling and legible penmanship “in good round hand” among other accomplishments

                        Most copybooks modeled the formal script known as <i>English round hand</i> or <i>copperplate</i>, for which 
                        an influential standard had been set by the copybook, <span class="title-manual_guide-BICKHAMUNIVERSALPENMAN"><i>Universal Penman</i></span> (<span class="date-1733-1741">1733–41</span>), 
                        jointly authored by the engraver and writing master, <span class="persName-GBE">George Bickham</span> (<span class="date-1684-1758">1684–1758</span>), and his son. Practiced using a pen with a flexible quill nib, 
                        round hand called for a looping style that accentuated contrasts of thin and thick strokes, a style related to the late eighteenth‐century transitional and modern typefaces 
                        that featured these extreme contrasts, such as Baskerville and Bodoni 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#CRAMSIEGRAPHIC" target="_self">Cramsie, <span class="title-book-CRAMSIEGRAPHIC"><i>Story of Graphic Design</i></span></a>, 119–21). 
                        In the eighteenth century, round hand settled into a practical but elegant script that was less elaborate than earlier versions, and that was widely used in business. 
                        In the view of a historian of calligraphy, the common English round hand was “colourless, thoroughly unromantic, and dull”; however, these “were precisely 
                        the qualities which commended [the hand] to those who wrote our invoices and to those abroad who received them”; and this “plain hand for a plain purpose” 
                        was typified in the nineteenth century by “the books of <span class="persName-EDB">Butterworth</span>”, in which the hand became “even more matter‐of‐fact and more standardised” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MORISONDEVELOPMENTOFHANDWRITING" target="_self"><span class="persName-SMORISON">Morison</span>, <span class="title-essay-MORISONDEVELOPMENTOFHANDWRITING">“Development of Hand‐Writing”</span></a>, xxxiii, xl).</div>

                        <span class="persName-EDB">Butterworth</span>ʼs practical text, however, modeled an elegant but easy round hand that was less demanding and time‐consuming than his earlier “double print”,

                        “has induced such habits of laborious study as will at least place him on an equality if he does not go beyond many 
                        of far higher genius”; and one sign of the dogged self‐improvement was his “trying by copying <span class="persName-EDB">Butterworth</span> to improve

                        but laborious exercises were not required, as in <span class="persName-JRPSONWILLIAM">William</span>ʼs case, to make up for the lack in native genius.
