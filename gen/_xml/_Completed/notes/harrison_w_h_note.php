                    mentions his age as eighty&#x2010;one, which would push his birth year back to <span class="date-1792">ca. 1792</span> (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFMSL5" target="_self">John James Ruskin, Letters to W. H. Harrison</a>).

                    As their home residence, the Harrisons lived nearby the Ruskins in the suburb of <span class="placeName-CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</span>, 
                    but <span class="persName-THILTON">Hilton</span> believes that, though <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> often dined at <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> and later <span class="placeName-">Denmark Hill</span>, &#x201C;the Ruskins did not call at his small, poor home&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#HILTONRUSKINLATERYEARS" target="_self"><span class="title-book-HILTONRUSKINLATERYEARS"><i>John Ruskin: The Later Years</i></span></a>, 217). <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> typically addressed <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> at his Crown Life office to discuss editorial business.</div>
               
               <div class="p">When the Ruskins first became acquainted with <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> (presumably when he took over editorship of 
                    <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>), he would have been able to regale them 
                    with reports of conversation with such relics of Regency literary society as <span class="persName-WTB">William Beckford</span> (ca. <span class="date-1760-1844">1760&#x2013;1844</span>) 
                    as well as with influential literary men of the day, such as the editor <span class="persName-WJ">William Jerdan</span> (ca. <span class="date-1782-1869">1782&#x2013;1869</span>) 
                    and the author and clergyman <a href="/notes/croly_george_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-GCREV">George Croly</span> (ca. <span class="date-1780-1860">1780&#x2013;1860</span>)</a>. 
                    <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>&#x02BC;s piquant recollections of famous writers&#x02BC; appearance, haunts, and conversation suggest a man of humor and observation, 
                    and a frequenter of convivial and benevolent institutions such as the Literary Fund Club. <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> then was a respectable 
                    City man with minor literary and artistic connections, who for that reason would have appealed to <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, 
                    and who shared <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s ultra&#x2010;Tory opinions about the supremacy of the British church and state as a bulwark against Roman Catholicism. 
                    <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> was also, one suspects, obsequious to the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskins</span>&#x02BC; pretensions and did not object to taking a gentlemanly form of remuneration for his services.</div>
               
               <div class="p">According to his memoir, <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> traced his first encounter with a famous
                    author to hearing <span class="persName-STC">S. T. Coleridge</span> (ca.<span class="date-1772-1834">1772&#x2013;1834</span>), in lectures that can
                    be dated <span class="date-1812-1813">1812&#x2013;13</span>, when <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> would have been around twenty years old.
                    &#x201C;He was giving a series of lectures on the belles lettres in a large room on the first floor of a sixth&#x2010;rate tavern at
                    the end of a blind alley on the right hand side of <span class="placeName-building-FETTERLANE">Fetter Lane</span>, not far from
                    <span class="placeName-building-FLEETST">Fleet Street</span>. . . . I heard <span class="persName-STC">Coleridge</span> lecture the same winter at the Surrey Institution,

               <div class="p"><span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> was also personally acquainted with artists, connections that long pre&#x2010;existed 
                    his association with the Ruskins. He claimed that his friendship with the genre painter <span class="persName-WE">William Etty</span>
                    (ca. <span class="date-1787-1849">1787&#x2013;1849</span>) reached back to their teens:
                    &#x201C;When I first knew <span class="persName-WE">Etty</span> he was a pupil of <span class="persName-STL">Sir Thomas Lawrence</span>&#x201D; (i.e., <span class="date-1807">ca. 1807</span>)

                     <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> also knew the architectural painter and printmaker <span class="persName-DRP">David Roberts</span> (<span class="date-1796-1864">1796&#x2013;1864</span>), with whom he shared contributions to

               <div class="p"><span class="persName-DRP">Roberts</span> illustrated the <span class="title-annual-JENNINGSLANDSCAPE"><i>Jennings&#x02BC;s</i></span> volumes for <span class="date-1835-1838">1835&#x2013;38</span>,
                    based on his sketching excursion to <span class="placeName-SPAIN">Spain</span> in <span class="date-1832-1833">1832&#x2013;33</span>. 
                    <span class="persName-DRP">Roberts</span>&#x02BC;s series of <a href="/notes/annuals_note" target="_self">annuals</a> picturing <span class="placeName-IBERIA">Iberia</span> 
                    formed a &#x201C;monumental transcription of picturesque <span class="placeName-SPAIN">Spain</span>&#x201D; in the growing early&#x2010;Victorian &#x201C;visual archive&#x201D; representing the Romantic&#x2010;era journey to the peninsula, 
                    which shifted perceptions from British &#x201C;Enlightenment dismissals of <span class="placeName-SPAIN">Spain</span> as the antithesis of all rationalist ideas and practices 
                    to an enthusiastic &#x2018;hispanophilia&#x2019;&#x201D;. The letterpress for these volumes was written by <span class="persName-TRT">Thomas Roscoe</span> (ca. <span class="date-1791-1871">1791&#x2013;1871</span>), 
                    who drew on published sources but also on his personal observations made during an <span class="date-1835">1835</span> journey, which retraced <span class="persName-DRP">Roberts</span>&#x02BC;s earlier itinerary through the country 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#SAGLIAIMAGININGIBERIA" target="_self"><span class="persName-">Saglia</span>, <span class="title-essay-SAGLIAIMAGININGIBERIA">&#x201C;Imag(in)ing Iberia&#x201D;</span></a>, 127, 126, 123, 130). 
                    <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> provided letterpress for the follow&#x2010;up annual for <span class="date-1839">1839</span>, featuring scenes in <span class="placeName-PORTUGAL">Portugal</span>, 
                    on which he collaborated with the artist <span class="persName-JHP">James Holland</span> (ca. <span class="date-1799-1870">1799&#x2013;1870</span>). 
                    It is not clear whether <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> visited <span class="placeName-IBERIA">Iberia</span> for the purpose. In the preface, 
                    he noncommittally cites &#x201C;materials collected during a recent visit&#x201D;; and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> later intimated that his old friend never left <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>. 
                    The annual&#x02BC;s narrative is stiffly patched together from historical sources and a travel record of mundane encounters with fleas, dirt, and stubborn servants 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#HARRISONTOURISTINPORTUGAL" target="_self">Harrison, <i>Tourist in Portugal</i></a>, vi; and see

                    Since <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> undertook writing about <span class="placeName-PORTUGAL">Portugal</span> only a few years after taking over editorship of 
                    <a href="/notes/friendships_offering_note" target="_self"><span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span></a>, 
                    one can reasonably speculate that he collected useful information from <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, 
                    the father of his precocious contributor, <span class="persName-pen_name-JR">J.R.</span>, and the traveling partner of a firm that imported Portuguese sherry.</div>
               
               <div class="p">Subsequently, <span class="placeName-PORTUGAL">Portugal</span> became something of a specialty of <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>&#x02BC;s,
                    supplying the setting for other tales and poems in the annuals, such as .

                    in which he mentions the Ruskins only in passing, perhaps played a part in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s crafting 
                    of the much more delicately balanced rhetoric&#x2014;poised between nostalgic admiration and critical satire&#x2014;in his introduction to these sketches, 
                    <span class="title-essay-JRMYFIRSTEDITOR">&#x201C;My First Editor: An Autobiographical Reminiscence&#x201D;</span>. 
                    <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>, for his part, appears to have deemed reflection on his friendship and professional relation with the Ruskins 
                    to have been out of bounds for his memoir, with the possible exception of the section on <span class="placeName-OXFORD">Oxford</span>. 
                    That portion reads like an unused travel sketch for the annuals, recounted by the narrator of his tales and sketches&#x2014;genial, ironic, given to rhetorical flourish. 
                    The sketch concludes by opening a window only slightly on the relationship he developed with the 
                    &#x201C;Graduate of Oxford&#x201D;: &#x201C;As in athletics, so in intellectual contests, life is often the price of the prize. 
                    Here is a poem from the pen of an undergraduate, who has since achieved a world&#x2010;wide fame. 
                    It was published without the name of the author, and I dare not add it&#x201D;&#x2014;and he quotes <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s
