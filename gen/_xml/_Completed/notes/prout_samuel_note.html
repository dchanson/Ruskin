               <div class="p">Painter, best known for his picturesque views of architectural subjects,
                    primarily in the form of drawings, watercolors, oils, and prints. <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span> was a personal friend of the Ruskin family,
                    and it is easy to imagine why. Besides his evidently engaging personality, and
                    the artistic interests that he shared with the family, <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>ʼs religious biography paralleled that of the Ruskins, 
                    having been born into a Dissenter family
                    (Congregationalist) and migrated to the Established Church. 
                    His persistently poor health would have drawn the sympathy of the Ruskins, who themselves tended
                    to be preoccupied with ailments (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#LOCKETTPROUT" target="_self"><span class="persName-RLA">Lockett</span>, <span class="title-book-LOCKETTPROUT">?<i>Samuel Prout</i></span></a>, 18–20).</div>

                    over the years, although changing in tone and emphasis along with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs interests, seem always to revolve around verifiable truths about these early associations with the artist

                    and the lithographs presented in the <span class="title-artwork-PROUTSKETCHES"><i>Facsimiles</i></span>, although in the interim <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span> exhibited watercolors based on these tours.
                </div>
               
               <div class="p">Along with his pioneering destinations for sketching tours, <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span> was significant for exploring new media. 
                    Having developed his skills as a lithographer throughout the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>, <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span> 
                    “could claim to have been the first important lithographic artist in <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#LOCKETTPROUT" target="_self"><span class="persName-RLA">Lockett</span>, <span class="title-book-LOCKETTPROUT"><i>Samuel Prout</i></span></a>, 45). This mastery was first cultivated 
                    through association with <span class="persName-RAP">Rudolf Ackermann</span> (<span class="date-1764">1764</span>–<span class="date-1834">1834</span>), 
                    whose many entrepreneurial innovations included helping to introduce lithography to <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>. An early lithographic 
                    project was <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>ʼs <span class="title-collected_sketches-PROUTLIGHTSHADOW-italic">Hints on Light and Shadow</span> (<span class="date-1838">1838</span>), 
                    which linked <span class="persName-RAP">Ackermannʼs</span> sponsorship of the new medium to the firmʼs founding mission of art instruction 
                    and the manufacture of art materials (<a href="/notes/bibliography#FORDACKERMANN" target="_self"><span class="persName-JF">Ford</span>, <span class="title-book-FORDACKERMANN"><i>Ackermann</i></span></a>, 103, and see 21–28). 
                    Likewise, the novelty of the <span class="title-book-PROUTILLUSTRATIONSRHINE"><i>Illustrations of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span></i></span> as well as the 
                    <span class="title-collected_sketches-PROUTSKETCHES-italic">Facsimiles</span> lay partly in the lithographic medium, even as late as the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. 
                    <span class="persName-DRP">David Roberts</span>ʼs (<span class="date-1796">1796</span>–<span class="date-1864">1864</span>) lithographic views of the Holy Land, for example, 
                    lay a decade in the future. Already by <span class="date-1823">1823</span>, <span class="persName-RAP">Ackermann</span> was turning over <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>ʼs 
                    and other artistsʼ lithographic projects to <span class="persName-CH">Charles Hullmandel</span> (<span class="date-1789">1789</span>–<span class="date-1850">1850</span>) for printing, 
                    as <span class="persName-RAP">Ackermann</span> could not maintain quality along with supporting other projects, such as the mass production of 
                    <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>ʼs first successful 
                    <a href="/notes/annuals_note" target="_self">annual</a>, <span class="title-annual-FORGETMENOT"><i>Forget Me Not</i></span> (<span class="persName-JF">Ford</span>, <span class="persName-RAP">Ackermann</span>, 64; and see

               <div class="p">For the Ruskins in <span class="date-1833">1833</span>, the dramatic size (22 by 15 inches) of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>ʼs lithographic prints,
