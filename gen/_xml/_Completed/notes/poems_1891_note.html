               <div class="p"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>The Poems of John Ruskin</i></span>, edited by <a href="/notes/collingwood_w_g_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span></a>, 
      was published by <a href="/notes/allen_george_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-GA">George Allen</span></a> in <span class="date-1891">1891</span>. The two‐volume edition was released in the two forms that, by then, 
      <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span> had established on a plan that was profitable while remaining responsive to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs standards of quality for bookmaking and to his ideas of fair trade in selling and distributing books. 
                    That is, for modest consumers, <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span> made the two volumes available for ten shillings net, in the sturdy and serviceable <a href="/notes/uniform_edition_note" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRWORKSUNIFORMEDITION">Uniform Edition</span></a>. 
                    For collectors, <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span> produced a deluxe edition, lavishing his craftsmanʼs love of fine bookmaking on what a <span class="date-1900">1900</span> advertisement described as 
      “a Large Edition, with 23 Illustrations in Photogravure from Drawings by the Author and Facsimiles of MSS. Medium 4to”, priced at thirty shillings for the two volumes 
      (reproduced in <a href="/notes/bibliography#DAWSONPEOPLESRUSKIN" target="_self"><span class="persName-PDAWSON">Dawson</span>, <span class="title-book-DAWSONPEOPLESRUSKIN"><i>The Peopleʼs Ruskin</i></span></a>, ii). 
                    Even in the less expensive <a href="/notes/uniform_edition_note" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRWORKSUNIFORMEDITION">Uniform Edition</span></a> format, a few plates were bound into volume 1, which facsimiled samples of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs boyhood handwriting—embellishments 
                    that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> and <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span> likely deemed essential to all readersʼ experience of the materiality of the boyhood manuscripts as well as key to <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs arguments for dating the poems

                  <div class="p">Sporadic evidence suggests that plans for publication of the poems developed over a number of years. 
                            Presumably, from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs standpoint, his fatherʼs private publication of <a href="/notes/poems_1850_note" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1850"><i>Poems</i></span> by <span class="persName-JR">J. R.</span> (<span class="date-1850">1850</span>)</a> had long ago brought to a close 
                            any perceived need for further collecting of the poems. Ironically, it was the existence of that private publication that, 
                            because of its rarity and increasing interest as a collectorʼs item in the final third of the century, prompted the American publisher 
                            John Wiley & Sons to release an unauthorized edition, 
                            <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1882"><i>Poems by John Ruskin</i></span>, in <span class="date-1882">1882</span>. 
                            The volume was “collected and edited” by <span class="persName-JOWRIGHT">John Osborne Wright</span>, 
                            basing his copytext on poems published in the <a href="/notes/annuals_note" target="_self">literay annuals</a>. 
                            The wording of the title page, <i>collected and edited</i>, was clearly designed to evoke the sought‐after 
                            <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1850"><i>Poems</i></span> by <span class="persName-JR">J. R.</span> “collected | <span class="date-1850">1850</span>”; 
                            and <span class="persName-JOWRIGHT">Wright</span>ʼs preface highlighted the rising desirability of the <span class="date-1850">1850</span> volume, 
                            while pretending to scoff at the rare‐book market in which “copies have become virtually inaccessible except to the most rabid bibliomaniac, 
                            whose heavy purse enables him to successfully outbid competitors in the auction room and bookstore”. 
                            A footnote pointed to the sale of a copy in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> two years earlier for 41 guineas 
                            (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS1886" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1886"><i>Poems by John Ruskin</i></span>, ed. <span class="persName-JOWRIGHT">Osborne</span></a>, i, iv). 
                            While the <span class="persName-JOWRIGHT">Osborne</span> edition capitalized on the phenomenon of 
                            <a href="/notes/collecting_of_modern_authors_note" target="_self">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</a>, 
                            the bookʼs preface conveys an impression, however disingenuously, that its piracy was justified as a democratic public service, 
                            by bringing a rare and expensive resource within reach of the common reader.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> reacted aggressively to counter what he recognized as piracy, but his reaction was complicated by his ambivalence toward his early writings. 
                            Writing in <span class="date-1882">1882</span> to <a href="/notes/wedderburn_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-AW">Alexander Wedderburn</span></a>, he fumed perhaps less about piratical practices by American publishers or about an opportunistic reprint trade 
                            that was simultaneousy pursued by British publishers—issues that increasingly worried <a href="/notes/allen_george_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-GA">George Allen</span></a> 
                            (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#DAWSONGEORGEALLENOFSUNNYSIDE" target="_self"><span class="persName-PDAWSON">Dawson</span>, <span class="title-book-DAWSONGEORGEALLENOFSUNNYSIDE"><i>George Allen of Sunnyside</i></span></a>, 22, 25–26). 
                            Rather, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> at least pretended to be outraged more about English law, 
                            half‐playfully holding <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> personally responsible for his profession as a barrister: “what a beast British law is! 
                            Iʼm obliged to print these—at least a lot out of—these idiotisms—because another fellow—a blackguard—called Wily! [punning on Wileyʼs name]—has 
                            published them without my leave—copyright of [the literary annual] <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> being out! Theft & libel in one!” 
                            To <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, literary piracy was mere theft, whether at home or abroad, another way in which authors were denied 
                            fair pay in the tangled system of book dealing, from which he had attempted to extricate his work by setting up <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span> as his personal publisher. 
                            As <span class="persName-BEM">Brian Maidment</span> has argued, however, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs seemingly personalized complaints were more broadly polemical 
                            than the anger or resignation expressed by other British writers toward American piracy 
                            (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MAIDMENTPIRATEDBOOKS" target="_self"><span class="persName-BEM">Maidment</span>, <span class="title-essay-MAIDMENTPIRATEDBOOKS">“John Ruskin, George Allen, and American Pirated Books”</span></a>, 7–8). 
                            What especially piqued <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> about the Wiley edition was that, as he states in his letter to <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>, 
                            the publication combined theft with a “libel”, meaning that he disowned the poems as “idiotisms”, 
                            even as he was compelled to protect his property as a writer, since English copyright law failed to do so on his behalf 
                            (<span class="title-letter-jr_to_aw_1882-02-07">Ruskin to A. Wedderburn</span>, <span class="date-1882-02-07">7 February 1882</span>,

                            an unknown hand docketed this letter “83” in pencil above <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs “82” for the year).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">With only seeming irrelevance, the letter goes on to call out <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> 
                            for “your profession”, “mak[ing] <u>me</u> pay 300 pounds for calling <span class="persName-JAMW">Whistler</span> a coxcomb!”—referring 
                            to <span class="persName-JAMW">J. A. M. Whistler</span>ʼs <span class="date-1878">1878</span> libel case against <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> for the criticʼs disparaging comments about 
                            the painterʼs <span class="title-artwork-WHISTLERNOCTURNEINBLACKANDGOLD"><i>Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket</i></span> (<span class="date-1875">1875</span>). 
                            (Although <span class="persName-JAMW">Whistler</span> won his suit, the victory was pyrrhic, since he was awarded only a farthing in damages, 
                            while the plaintiff and defendant had to split court costs, which amounted to ??? on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs part [see  
                            (<span class="title-letter-jr_to_aw_1882-02-07">Ruskin to A. Wedderburn</span>, <span class="date-1882-02-07">7 February 1882</span>, 
                            in <a href="/notes/bibliography#ALSJRTOAW" target="_self">Ruskin ALS to Alexander Dundas Ogilvy Wedderburn, <span class="date-1874-1888">1874–1888</span></a>).
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs analogy equates what he sees as parallel cases of American chicanery from which English law 
                            failed to protect him—the painterʼs coxcomb “impudence” of charging high prices for “flinging a pot of paint in the public face”, 
                            and the “blackguard” wiliness of the American publisher scooping up <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs unprotected property and tossing it 
                            into an overheated book market, which the editor pretends to disparage while capitalizing on the exaggerated prices surrounding <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poems. 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> leaves unsaid, however, whether it is the edition or the poems themselves that constitute a “libel” on his reputation. 
                            Would he have conceded the logic of <span class="persName-JAMW">Whistler</span>ʼs self‐defense that the pricing of any portion of his work ought to be calibrated according to the artistʼs 
                            “knowledge of a lifetime𠄭? It would seem that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> ought to have allowed the point, 
                            given the biographical approach that he later adopted in his preface to his own edition, the <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i></span>, 
                            attributing a “peculiar interest” to the seemingly worthless juveniia as a witness to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs “development” and “growth”

                            the <span class="date-1891">1891</span> <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i></span> did not profit by the agreement, which applied only to new works published after <span class="date-1891">1891</span>. 
                            Nonetheless, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs edition was published in the <span class="placeName-USA">United States</span> legally, as part of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSBRANTWOODEDITION">Brantwood Edition</span> of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs works, 
                            which was produced under an agreement with the <span class="placeName-NYC">New York</span> firm, Charles E. Merrill & Company. While the 
                            <span class="title-book-JRWORKSBRANTWOODEDITION">Brantwood Edition</span> did not prove very profitable, it did pay royalties to the author 
                            while upholding <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs expectations for quality of bookmaking. This venture provided the foundation 
                            for <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span>ʼs subsequent attempts to arrive at mutually satisfactory terms with the Merrill Company 
                            for producing and marketing an “honest Ruskin” edition in the <span class="placeName-USA">United States</span>, although in the end the agreement seems to have led only to suspicion and grievance on both sides

                            since <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs edition was a new work with an introduction of its own, as opposed to the older works making up

                            It was also hoped that <span class="persName-CEN">Norton</span>ʼs name on the title pages would persuade consummers to justify the price of the edition, compared with the cheap and widely available American piracies.</div>

                                                of Mr. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs most intimate friend and most acute and sympathetic critic, many of them containing extracts from personal letters written 
                                                while the works were in preparation, give to this edition a rare and unique value. The two volumes of poetry written between the ages 
                                                of seven and twenty‐six, with an appendix of later poems now first collected from original manuscript and printed sources, 
                                                are edited in chronological order, with notes biographical and critical, by Mr. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs secretary, <a href="/notes/collingwood_w_g_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-WGC">William G. Collingwood</span>, M.A.</a> 
                                                The chronological arrangement of the poems—the authorʼs age at the time of writing being printed at the top of each page—illustrates 
                                                in a most interesting manner the development of his mind and style. The two volumes of poems have been copyrighted in this country under the new law,

                        By the <span class="date-1890-1899">1890s</span>, the privately printed and distributed <span class="date-1850">1850</span> edition of the <i>Poems</i> had taken on a talismanic aura for rare book collectors, 
                        and <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>inevitably justified the purposes of the <span class="date-1891">1891</span> edition in part by appealing to the “no idle curiosity . . .  that prompts the admirers 
                        of Mr. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs works to collect his boyish writings and to learn the story of his youth”. But he also denies playing to this audience, 
                        arguing that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> is “misunderstood by the casual reader” etc. (v–vi).

                  <div class="p">In his editorial rationale, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>, admitted that the poemsʼ “author himself has never brought them forward”, 
                        it being “impossible for him to offer his own juvenile productions as examples of the lofty ideal he preached” in his attempt to elevate 
                        “the public taste in poetry as well as art” (a half truth, since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did occasionally quote from his juvenilia, 
                        with precisely the purpose of showing that they adumbrated his ideals). <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>, however, was determined to shape the corpus 
                        of early writing in favor of the “sonorous line and noble thought”, the “genuine feeling and fine, enthusiastic description”. 
                        Without expurgating irony and fun, <span class="persName-WGC">the editor</span> felt obliged to present the consistency of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs 
                        “ways, and aims, and attitude”—conditions that “in his case, more than with” other writers, were “determined at an early age, 
                        and illustrated in his early writings. That is the recurrent burden of his autobiography:—‘I find in myself nothing whatsoever <i>changed</i>’”

                  <div class="p">Although printed in the back of volume 1 like an appendix, the “Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS8D1891" target="_self">Ruskin, <i>Poems</i> [8, 1891]</a>, 1:261–67;

                        probably reflects in its title the accurate relation of the “Note” to the remainder of the edition. As a “preliminary” effort, the descriptive bibliography dates at least in part to <span class="date-1889">1889</span> or earlier, 
                        on the evidence of the binding history of <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span>. In the “Note”, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> describes <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span> as “an envelope containing loose papers”,
                        whereas in its present state this manuscript is bound in several volumes. These bindings originated in <span class="date-1889">1889</span> at the latest, although the physical and documentary evidence is obscured and somewhat muddled 
                        (<a href="/apparatuses/msxi_apparatus#DESCRIPTION" target="_self">see MS XI: Description</a>). Thus, while <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> apparently failed to revise his “Note” to reflect ongoing efforts respecting the manuscriptsʼ preservation and provenance—efforts that may 
                        have been beyond his ken (see Provenance of Early Manuscripts at Denmark Hill and Brantwood)—the “Note” does record a “preliminary” stage of the editorial project. And this makes sense, 
                        as the noteʼs stated purpose is to justify the chronology that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> used to arrange the edition: “After some study of these ancient Codices, . . . the Editor has been able to disentangle their contents 
                        and to arrange them in chronological order; which it may be worth while to note here, both for the assistance of future students, and in jusification of the hypothetical dates assigned to some of the poems”

                        of whose “full account of the published poems” in the

                        1:268). <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> was therefore to some degree influenced by <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span>ʼs manipulation of the bibliographical record in favor of juvenile poems 
                        that <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span> could forge in the form of “rare” pamphlets (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#DEARDENWISERUSKINI" target="_self"><span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span>, “<span class="title-essay-DEARDENWISERUSKINI">Wise and Ruskin I</span>”</a>, 46–47;

                  <div class="p">In this instance, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> avows his responsibility—“the very few emendations I have presumed to make 
                        are marked by square brackets”—and while he tended to be much more casual than a twenty‐first‐century editor would be 
                        about what emendations needed flagging, we probably can safely assume that these aesthetic “emendations” were his, and not specifically authorized 
                        by the elderly <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>. In his notes and prefaces to the edition, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> always refers 
                        to the authorʼs investment in the edition in the past tense, as having authorized the editorʼs judgments but resigned his own responsibility, 
                        consistent with <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs general statement that closes his
