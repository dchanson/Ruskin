                    For the same issue of the annual for <span class="date-1835">1835</span>, <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> also commissioned a new poem by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>,

               <div class="p"><span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> was born in the Scottish border county of <span class="placeName-ROXBURGHSHIRE">Roxburghshire</span>. After brief involvement in <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span> journalism, he emigrated in <span class="date-1820">1820</span> to <span class="placeName-SAFRICA">South Africa</span>, 
                    where he worked as a journalist and writer, librarian, and teacher, returning to <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> in <span class="date-1826">1826</span>. There, he grew important for his work on behalf of the abolitionist cause, 
                    and he became known for his poetry evoking rural life in <span class="placeName-SAFRICA">South Africa</span>. On <span class="date-1834-06-28">28 June 1834</span>, the day following his signing of the official proclamation ending slavery in the British Empire, 
                    and thus consummating his lifeʼs work dedicated to abolition, <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> experienced distress that he interpreted as a “crumb of bread” going down “the wrong throat”, 
                    but that proved to be a sign of advancing tuberculosis, leading to his death before the end of the year 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#VIGNEPRINGLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-RV">Vigne</span>, <span class="title-book-VIGNEPRINGLE"><i>Thomas Pringle</i></span></a>, 241).
                </div>
               
               <div class="p">It was while making his way as an editor in the <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> literary scene of the <span class="date-1826-1833">late 1820s and early 1830s</span> that <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> encountered the Ruskin family. 
                    <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> became editor of <a href="/notes/friendships_offering_note" target="_self"><span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span></a>  
                    in <span class="date-1828">1828</span>, starting his responsibilities with the volume for <span class="date-1829">1829</span> 
                    (that is, the volume that became available for purchase in <span class="date-1828-10-1828-11">October or Novemeber 1828</span>, intended for <span class="date-1828-12-1829-01">the holiday season of 1828–29</span>). 
                    The annual had been acquired in <span class="date-1827">1827</span> by the young publishing firm of Smith, Elder, from its founding publisher; 
                    and Smith, Elder released their first issue (the volume for <span class="date-1828">1828</span>, published in <span class="date-1827-11">November 1827</span>) 
                    under the editorship of <span class="persName-CK">Charles Knight</span>. When <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> took over, he remained editor until his death in <span class="date-1834-12">December 1834</span>, 
                    having already prepared the volume for <span class="date-1835">1835</span>—the volume in which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poems appeared—and  
                    and sent it to press in <span class="date-1834-08">August 1834</span> 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#VIGNEPRINGLE" target="_self">Vigne, <span class="title-biography-VIGNEPRINGLE"><i>Thomas Pringle</i></span></a>, 183, 244;

                    During his illness in this final year of his editorship, <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> was assisted by

                    and therefore the Ruskins may have had some contact with this writer and editor, as well, in preparing <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs first poems for a widely distributed public venue.
                </div>
               
               <div class="p">Precisely how <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>ʼs acquaintance with the Ruskins came about is unknown. 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs later reminiscences of <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> are subordinated to wry rhetorical purposes. First, in the <span class="date-1878">1878</span> <span class="title-essay-RUSKINMYFIRSTEDITOR">“My First Editor: An Autobiographical Reminiscence,”</span> 
                  <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> appears as prelude to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs tribute to 
                    <a href="/notes/harrison_w_h_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-WHH">W. H. Harrison</span> (ca. <span class="date-1792-1878">1792–1878</span>)</a>, 
                    the poet and editor with whom <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> maintained a much longer professional relationship, 
                    and who succeeded <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> as one of the stewards of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> for Smith, Elder. 
                    Second, in <span class="date-1885-1889">1885–89</span>, in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs autobiography, 
                    <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>ʼs story is involved in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs self-irony and satire about his fledgling career as a poet, 
                    a vocation that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> ultimately rejected, but that his father cherished and had attempted to nourish in company with men like <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> and <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>.
                </div>
               
               <div class="p">As <span class="persName-RV">Rudolphe Vigne</span> points out, in his monograph on <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>, the association between <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> and the Ruskins would have rested on their shared Scottish heritage and literary interests, 
                    and <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> may have centered his high regard more on <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> than on <span class="persName-JR">John</span>. 
                    To document this friendship, <span class="persName-RV">Vigne</span> has uncovered a letter (unfortunately undated), 
                    in which <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> mentions “my friend <span class="persName-JJR">Mr Ruskin</span> of the house of Domecq and Co., . . . the greatest sherry merchants in <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>. I have drunk at <span class="persName-JJR">Mr Ruskin</span>ʼs table 
                    sherry 80 years old, and which sells at 26 shillings a bottle”

                    A key figure in these connections may have been <span class="persName-AE">Alexander Elder</span> (<span class="date-1790">1790</span>–<span class="date-1876">1876</span>), 
                    one of the founding partners of Smith, Elder. The firmʼs counting house was located around the corner from the premises of 
                    Telford, Ruskin, & Domecq, and <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> would have shared Elderʼs artistic interests

               <div class="p">For <span class="persName-JR">John</span>, a more compelling figure in these connections may have been his cousin,

                    In <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> remembers that, “on Sundays”, <span class="persName-CTR">Charles</span> “always brought a volume or two in his pocket to show us 
                    the character of [the firmʼs] most ambitious publications; especially choosing, on my behalf, any which chanced to contain good engravings”, 
                    and he writes that “we all took” an interest “in the embossed and gilded” annual
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 35:91). 
                    The gift of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> earned no approval from <span class="persName-MR">Ruskinʼs mother</span>, however,

                    and who concluded that “upon the whole [the publication] does not improve” the mind: “the plates are well done but they are not interesting”, 
                    and “the tales are horrible enough”, and “the poetry very so I think”

                    (see <a href="/notes/friendships_offering_note" target="_self"><span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span></a>). 
                    It contained contributions by his longtime friend,

                    whom <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> was likely responsible for introducing personally to the Ruskins at <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span>, 
                    sometime between <span class="date-1832-01-14-1832-02-19">14 January and 19 February 1832</span>. 
                    In <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, this connection proved significant for the Ruskins—at least as significant as another great man with whom 
                    <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> remained more closely associated in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs memory—namely, 
                    <a href="/notes/rogers_samuel_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-SR">Samuel Rogers</span> (<span class="date-1763-1855">1763–1855</span>)</a>, to whom

               <div class="p"><span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> did admit <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> to his circle, as <span class="persName-RV">Vigne</span> confirms (<a href="/notes/bibliography#VIGNEPRINGLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-RV">Vigne</span>, <span class="title-book-VIGNEPRINGLE"><i>Thomas Pringle</i></span></a>, 191–92), 
                    but we have only <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs much later, barbed accounts of the episode, wherein the boy allegedly failed to flatter <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> adequately about the poetry of his topographical volume, <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, 
                    and instead found greater interest in the engraved vignettes for the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> illustrated edition, and in the pictures on <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs walls. 
                    Accordingly, <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> chided his charge for failing to attend to the conversation of great men.
                    The anecdote may or may not be plausible, but a more significant and fundamental question concerns the motivation and outcome of <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>ʼs introduction of the fourteen‐ or fifteen‐year old boy wonder
