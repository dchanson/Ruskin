                    and advancing later to become the main art critic.

               <div class="p"><span class="persName-WR">Robertsʼs</span> career typified a phenomenon of professional British art history in the <span class="date-1901-1934">early twentieth century,</span> 
                    whereby, according to <span class="persName-BAA">Brian Allen,</span> “the study of historic British painting was almost entirely in the hands 
                    of the art trade”. <span class="persName-WR">Roberts</span> ranked as a leading so‐called “expert” who worked with <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> art dealers, 
                    authoring pamphlets designed to sell individual paintings. 
                    “These now rather rare and often sumptuous publications are invariably anonymous”, <span class="persName-BAA">Allen</span> remarks, 
                    “undoubtedly written by scholars who were cautious about protecting their anonymity”. 
                    Although he and others like him operated outside the institutional art establishment, 
                    “<span class="persName-WR">Roberts</span> . . . would, for five pounds, write certificates of authenticity for any <span class="date-1701-1800">eighteenth‐century</span> British picture placed in front of him”
