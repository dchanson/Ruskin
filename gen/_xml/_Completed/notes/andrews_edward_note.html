                        <span class="persName-EA">Reverend Andrews</span>, as combining evangelical seriousness with a robust appreciation of the arts.
                    Descended from a learned and sophisticated <span class="geogName-ESSEX">Essex</span> family, he followed his father and grandfather into the Nonconformist clergy,
                    studying at Hoxton Theological College, and then at Glasgow University (the latter a Scottish connection
                    that perhaps recommended him to the Ruskinsʼ favor)

                    According to <span class="persName-EPH">Edwin Paxton Hood</span> (<span class="date-1820-1885">1820–85</span>), a Congregational minister and a prolific writer about the preaching of his time,
                    <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> maintained that “God . . . should be worshipped with the best of everything . . . best architecture, best painting,
                    best music, best sculpture, best poetry, and best genius”

                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> entered the Congregationalist Hoxton Academy in <span class="date-1808">1808</span>.
                     Founded in <span class="date-1778">1778</span>, Hoxton was at this time a growing and important academy,
                    accommodating thirty to forty students in residence (<a href="/notes/bibliography#GLENLAUNCHINGCLERICALCAREER" target="_self"><span class="persName-RGLEN">Glen</span>, <span class="title-essay-GLENLAUNCHINGCLERICALCAREER">“Launching a Clerical Career in Late Georgian <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>”</span></a>, 645).
                    The principal, a Scottish divine, <span class="persName-RSREV">Robert Simpson</span> (1746–1817), did not have the reputation of a scholar,
                     and candidates were chosen primarily for their “good natural abilities”, zeal, and commitment to evangelical doctrine
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#NUTTALLTRAININGHOXTON" target="_self"><span class="persName-GFNUTTALL">Nuttall</span>, <span class="title-essay-NUTTALLTRAININGHOXTON">“Training for Hoxton and Highbury”</span></a>, 477;

                     Nonetheless, by the time of <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>ʼs matriculation, the Academy was observing higher standards of learning,
                    including securing scholarships to Glasgow University. An <span class="date-1810">1810</span> syllabus shows that available studies included the following subjects,
                     divided among three tutors: “Hebrew and biblical criticism, Jewish antiquities,
                    evidences of divine revelation, systematic divinity, ecclesiastical history, and its connexion with profane [especially Roman] history; . . .
                    English grammar, geography, Latin (including prose composition) and Greek; . . . pneumatology, logic, and belles lettres,
                    with special regard to pulpit composition and elocution”. Students who, like <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>, proceeded to Glasgow University fell under
                     the supervision of <span class="persName-GEREV">Greville Ewing</span> (1767–1841), a Congregational minister and a tutor at the Glasgow Theological Academy

                  <div class="p">The Ruskins began hearing <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> preach in the parish of <span class="placeName-WALWORTH">Walworth</span>, which was a village lying only a few miles south of
                    <span class="placeName-LONDONBRDG">London Bridge</span>. Like <a href="/notes/camberwell_note" target="_self"><span class="placeName-CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</span></a>, a little farther to the south
                    where the Ruskins lived, <span class="placeName-WALWORTH">Walworth</span> was a rapidly growing suburb but still on the edge of the open country and woods around <span class="placeName-NORWOOD">Norwood</span> and <span class="placeName-DULWICH">Dulwich</span>.
                    The Andrewsesʼ household resembled the Ruskinsʼ with its growing collection of pictures on the walls, a substantial library on the shelves, and gardens outside,
                    but it would have been a much busier and noisier place than <a href="/notes/herne_hill_note" target="_self"><span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span></a>.
                    By the beginning of <span class="date-1831">1831</span>, the manse had seventeen inhabitants, including <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> and his wife,
                    <span class="persName-EHSA">Elizabeth (née Elizabeth Honor Symons)</span>, who was learned and fond of music like her husband; twelve children
                    (by <span class="date-1831-06">June 1831</span>, two would die in infancy); three servants; and a few penurious clergymen dependent on the Andrews familyʼs charity.
                    In addition, a constant flow of visitors was drawn to the house by the familyʼs sociability and parish responsibilities. This rising star of the metropolitan pulpit was highly visible,
                    helped by a dashing appearance that commanded no fewer than a dozen painted, engraved, and sculpted portraits in his relatively brief prime
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#ANSTRUTHERCOVENTRYPATMORESANGEL" target="_self"><span class="title-book-ANSTRUTHERCOVENTRYPATMORESANGEL"><i>Coventry Patmoreʼs Angel</i></span></a>, 13, 19, 123–24). 
                    A portrait, <a href="/figures/andrews_edward_evangelicalmag_engraving" target="_self"><span class="title-artwork-WILDMANANDREWS"><i>Rev<sup>d</sup>. D<sup>r</sup>. Andrews</i></span></a>, 
                    which likely was available to the young <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, was published in the the <span class="date-1828-06">June 1828</span> issue of the <a href="/notes/evangelical_magazine_note" target="_self"><span class="title-periodical-EVANGELICALMAG"><i>Evangelical Magazine</i></span></a>, 
                    a periodical subscribed by <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>. Each issue of the magazine featured a full‐page engraved portrait of a clergyman, so the choice of <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> as a subject 
                    testified to his growing prominence (see <a href="/apparatuses/a_theme_apparatus#DISCUSSION" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-JRATHEME">“a theme”</span>: Discussion</a>).

                    He was at first a candidate for <span class="placeName-building-CAMDENCHAPEL">Camden Chapel</span> in <span class="placeName-WALKWORTH">Camberwell</span>,
                    where he stirred such excitement that the congregation demanded him for their pastor. Blocked by their trustees,
                    some members of the congregation broke away and built the <span class="placeName-building-WALWORTHCHAPEL">Walworth Chapel</span> for him, financed to some extent by <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>ʼs wealthy father‐in‐law

                    Such generous arrangements were not unheard‐of among the most popular preachers—especially those whose congregations included wealthy members—the
                    largest of such complexes being <span class="placeName-building-SURREYCHAPEL">Surrey Chapel</span>, built to accommodate audiences of 3,000 for the preaching

The crowds pressing to hear <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>
                    soon grew too large for the <span class="placeName-building-BERESFORDCHAPEL">Beresford Street Chapel</span>, and <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> decided to finance an expansion with the aid of a new mortgage, which ultimately proved a ruinous
                    encumberment (<a href="/notes/bibliography#CLEALSTORYCONGREGATIONALISM" target="_self"><span class="persName-EECLEAL">Cleal</span>, <span class="title-book-CLEALSTORYCONGREGATIONALISM"><i>The Story of Congregationalism in <span class="placeName-SURREY">Surrey</span></i></span></a>, 105).
                    In his glory days, <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> attracted crowds larger than could be seated, even in the expanded structure accommodating 1,600 seats
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#ANSTRUTHERCOVENTRYPATMORESANGEL" target="_self"><span class="title-book-ANSTRUTHERCOVENTRYPATMORESANGEL"><i>Coventry Patmoreʼs Angel</i></span></a>, 22–23).</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">In <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> remembered the chapel as an example of
                    “the Londonian chapel in its perfect type, definable as accurately as a Roman basilica,—an oblong, flat‐ceiled barn,
                    lighted by windows with semi‐circular heads, brick‐arched, filled by small‐paned glass held by iron bars, like fine threaded halves of cobwebs; galleries propped
                    on iron pipes, up both side; pews, well shut in, each of them, by partitions of plain deal, and neatly brass‐latched deal doors, filling the barn floor,
                    all but its two lateral straw‐matted passages; pulpit, sublimely isolated, central from sides and clear of altar rails at end; a stout, four‐legged box
                    of well‐grained wainscot, high as the level of front galleries, and decorated with a cushion of crimson velvet, padded six inches thick, with gold tassels at the corners,
                    which was a great resource to me when I was tired of the sermon, because I liked watching the rich colour of the folds and creases that came in it when the clergyman thumped it”.
                    Like his representation in the autobiography of the toyless austerity of his boyhood, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> exaggerated this description, here in order to make the point that his
                    “well‐formed habit [in youth] of narrowing myself to happiness within . . . four brick walls” supported his “acute perception and deep feeling of the beauty of architecture
                    and scenery abroad” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 35:132; and see

                    While an <span class="date-1824">1824</span> <span class="title-artwork-HASSELLBERESFORDCHAPEL">watercolor of the exterior of <span class="placeName-building-BERESFORDCHAPEL">Beresford Chapel</span></span> by <span class="persName-JHARTIST">John Hassell</span> (<span class="date-1767-1825">1767–1825</span>),
                    and a comic sketch of the interior of this “dreary Bethal” by <span class="persName-ECBJ">Edward Burne‐Jones</span>, suggest
                    that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs prose picture captures accurately enough the “perfect type” of the late‐Georgian meeting house,
                    <span class="persName-EPH">Hood</span> remembered that the buildingʼs unusually rich adornments “gave you certainly no idea of the dissenting conventicle”.
                    There were “stained glass, and the <span class="persName-scriptural-AARON">Aaronic</span> and <span class="persName-scriptural-MOSES">Mosaic</span> figures,
                    the <span class="persName-scriptural-">Baptist</span> and <span class="persName-scriptural-STPAUL">St. Paul</span> in carving—the rich, loud organ, and the altar‐piece”—the
                    grander fittings perhaps features of the heavily mortgaged expansion, and “far beyond what was usual in Nonconformist buildings of that period”

                  <div class="p">The organ, which members of the Andrews family played, was a particularly vital resource for recitalists contributing musical culture in the locale.
                    <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> himself was proficient on several instruments, and his accomplishments extended to other arts, as well

                    He had some success as a sacred dramatist, with titles including <span class="title-drama-ANDREWSVINEYARDNABOTH"><i>The Vineyard of <span class="persName-scriptural-NABOTH">Naboth</span>: A Dramatic Fragment</i></span>
                    (“translated from the original Hebrew”), which was printed in <span class="date-1825">1825</span>. Another title, <span class="title-drama-ANDREWSSAMPSON"><i>Sampson</i></span>,
                    <span class="persName-EPH">Hood</span> effuses, might have been penned by <span class="persName-STC">Coleridge</span>

                    Of <span class="persName-EA">Andrew</span>sʼs varied pursuits—many of which were self‐financed, like his chapel—a crucial one for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was the role of editor. As proprietor and editor of a magazine, the
                    <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span>, <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> gained the distinction of serving as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs first editor and publisher,
                    by printing versions of the youthʼs poem, <a href="/apparatuses/on_skiddaw_and_derwentwater_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER">“On Skiddaw and Derwentwater”</span></a>

                  <div class="p">In preaching, the method recommended by <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>ʼs principal at Hoxton, <span class="persName-RSIMP">Robert Simpson</span>, was to commit written sermons to memory in order to enjoy more “liberty in the pulpit”,
                    and thereby cultivate the “new style” of sermonizing by evangelical Dissenters, which pursued passion and drama and at least the impression of extempore inspiration

                    This method seems to account for <span class="persName-EPH">Hood</span>ʼs anecdotes about <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>ʼs “eccentricities”, such as his pausing in the middle of a sermon, confessing that “‘as I came up those
                    pulpit stairs, I had all the parts of this sermon well written on my mind’”, but that now he could not remember the third head; and so he commanded the organist to “‘strike up
                    a symphony’” while the remainder came back to him. His “luxuriant fancy” seemed all the more glorious “because apparently so unpremeditated”

                        nonetheless, she maintained her role in <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs education, “supply[ing <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs] place morning and evening as reader” in his absence,
                        as she reminded her husband. Beyond the daily Bible chapters, diversified by travels and histories, that she had read with <span class="persName-JR">John</span> since early boyhood,

                        In choosing to study a grammar text at this juncture in <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs education, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> demonstrates that she accepted the Englishwomanʼs role, if not to instruct erudite languages, at least to assist in regulating language.
                        She thereby supported <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs rite of passage to masculinity, advancing him from her teaching of the English mother tongue since infancy,
                        and passing him along to the male domain of classical languages taught by a master
                        (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#COHENFASHIONING" target="_self"><span class="persName-MCOHEN">Cohen</span>, <span class="title-book-COHENFASHIONING"><i>Fashioning Masculinity</i></span></a>, 31).
                        Yet in the choice of a sophisticated philosophical treatise on grammar like <span class="persName-JHT">Tooke</span>ʼs, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> also asserts her own intellectual ambition: while acknowledging to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> that “the greek & Latin quotations increase . . .
                    [the bookʼs] obscurity greatly to me[,] still I think I comprehend more than when I last looked over” the book; and now she finds herself “amused as well as interested[;] how can people who are not always occupied
                    in business & society exist without reading or hearing reading[?]”.

                  <div class="p">While tutoring <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>ʼs fortunes declined as rapidly as they had risen. As early as <span class="date-1829-10">October 1829</span>,
                    <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> perceived him as overextended: “I fear the Doctor will undertake too much[;] he is getting more pupils” (<a href="/apparatuses/mr_to_jjr_1829-10-31_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter of <span class="date-1829-10-31">31 October 1829</span></span></a>

                    In <span class="date-1831">1831</span>, tragedy beset the family, when <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>ʼs wife, <span class="persName-EHSA">Elizabeth</span>, grew ill from the birth of their twelfth child.
                    Long weakened by consumption, <span class="persName-EHSA">Elizabeth</span> died in <span class="date-1831-04">April 1831</span>, followed shortly by the passing of the two youngest infants

                    In <span class="date-1831-03">March 1831</span>, as these calamities approached, <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> paid what <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>
                    considered an unseemly morning visit, to unload “a long account of [his <span class="persName-EHSA">wife</span>ʼs]
                    complaints in the hope“, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> felt certain, “that I should say there was no chance of her living long”.
                    Despite such an “imprudent” confession to a parishioner whom he had known “so short a time” in <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs estimation,
                    <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> could not forebear from “enlarg[ing] much on the torment [his wife] . . . had been to him for these last ten years”, making him endure “caprice, jealousy,
                    unreasonableness and violence” that “has marred his respectability and fortune and prevented his filling that place in society his talents entitle him to”

                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-MRC">Margaret</span>ʼs account incidentally suggests
                    that <span class="persName-EHSA">Elizabeth Andrews</span>ʼs real offense may have been that she was an intellectual and talented woman who had earned censure
                    for failing to observe the boundaries that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would later define for “queens”
                    in his <span class="date-1864">1864</span> lecture, <span class="title-essay-JRQUEENS">“Of Queensʼ Gardens”</span>.
                    Womenʼs education, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would opine, should be “nearly, in its course and material of study, the same as a boyʼs;
                    but quite differently directed” in order to “sympathize in her husbandʼs pleasures,
                    and in those of his best friends”. <span class="persName-EHSA">Elizabeth</span> was condemned of lacking sympathetic supportiveness, since her perceived mania, whatever it was,
                    had damaged her husbandʼs “respectability and fortune and prevented his filling that place in society his talents entitle him to”.
                    Regardless of whether <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>ʼs vocation and talents qualified as the maleʼs “foundational and progressive”
                    labor that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would later pronounce to be deserving of female sympathy, no one evidently thought to ask whether this womanʼs studies might have been just as foundational for her
                    (<span class="title-book-JRSESAME"><i>Sesame and Lilies</i></span>, in <a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 18:128).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>, at least, pointed out that <span class="persName-EA">Edward Andrews</span> deserved a share of blame for his <span class="persName-EHSA">wife</span>ʼs condition,
                    since “to any woman with so numerous a family [he must] have caused much serious and distressing apprehension”,
                    given his “flighty . . . habits and manner of conducting his secular affairs, though with the best and kindest intentions”. In criticizing his flightiness,
                    <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> perhaps referred in part to <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>ʼs extravagance
                    in bearing children, no less than his improvidence in cultivating the arts and expensive tastes beyond a clergymanʼs sphere—the Ruskins having obviously demonstrated greater self‐government
                    in childbearing, much less allowing “unwise indulgence of” a womanʼs alleged “caprice”
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 243).
                    In any case, and for whatever cause, after <span class="persName-EHSA">Elizabeth</span>ʼs death in <span class="date-1831">1831</span> the Andrews family grew distressed financially,
                    and the mortgage was called in on the chapel. Nonetheless, <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> continued to tutor <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>,
                    apparently to everyoneʼs satisfaction, until <span class="date-1833">1833</span> or <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, when the youthʼs preparation for university
                    was taken over by the <a href="/notes/dale_thomas_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-TDREV">Reverend Thomas Dale</span> (<span class="date-1797-1870">1797–1870</span>)</a>

                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> died in <span class="date-1841">1841</span>, leaving his family destitute, and forcing the two eldest sons to emigrate to <span class="placeName-AUSTRALIA">Australia</span>
                    in search of better fortune, while the remaining family gathered for protection around their eldest sister, <span class="persName-EO">Eliza</span>, who had married well
