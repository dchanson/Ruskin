               <div class="p">Hiring couriers like the Ruskinsʼ <span class="persName-SALVADOR">Salvador</span> was, according to <span class="persName-JM">John Murray</span>ʼs <span class="date-1836">1836</span> guidebook to the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span>, 
                    preferable to bringing English servants, who, knowing only their own language, were “worse than useless” 
                    (putting aside a specialized role for an English servant such as tending to the children, performed for the Ruskins on these earlier tours by <span class="persName-ASB">Anne Strachan</span>). 
                    <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span>ʼs guidebook lists, along with advice about couriersʼ employment, wages, and treatment, their duties as typically consisting in 
                    “preceding the carriage at each stage, to secure relays of post horses”; 
                    arranging for “reception at inns” and securing “comfortable rooms, clean and well‐aired beds, and order[ing] meals to be prepared”; examining the carriage daily for needed repairs, 
                    as “it is his fault if any accident occur <i>en route</i>, from neglect of such precautions”; superintending “the packing and unpacking of the luggage” 
                    and insuring its security; 
                    paying “innkeepers, postmasters, and postboys”; and performing “all the services of waiting and attendance, cleaning and brushing clothes”, and so forth

               <div class="p">As qualifications, <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> emphasizes the courierʼs written as well as verbal command of the languages of the places being visited. “He never, however, performs the office of a 
                    <i>valet de place</i> while staying in a place, even though he may be well acquainted with it; this he considers out of his province”. 
                    <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> estimates wages as £8 to £10 monthly—even more, if engaged for less than two months; and less, if the traveler remains stationary in a place for an extended period

                    That the Ruskins were generous to their courier is suggested by <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>ʼs note that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs account book lists £100 for <span class="persName-SALVADOR">Salvador</span> under “Charity & Gifts” for <span class="date-1835">1835</span>

               <div class="p">The distinction between <span class="persName-SALVADOR">Salvador</span>ʼs role and that of a valet de place was observed by the Ruskins 
                    in the course of the <a href="/notes/tour_of_1833" target="_self">Tour of 1833</a> when engaging a local guide 
                    or “commissionaire” to sights, for example, in <span class="placeName-MAINZ">Mainz</span> [to come] 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFT48" target="_self">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</a>, 26). The distinction between ciceroni and domestic servants 
                    brought from home 
                    was later maintained in the respective roles of <span class="persName-SALVADOR">Salvador</span>ʼs successor, 
                    <span class="persName-JMC">Joseph Marie Couttet</span> (d. <span class="date-1874">1874</span>), and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs 
                    body servant, <span class="persName-JGH">John Hobbs (a.k.a “George”)</span> (d. <span class="date-1892">1892</span>). 
                    Characteristically for the Ruskins, these menʼs duties of looking after <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> while abroad, 
                    which began in the early <span class="date-1840-1845">1840s</span>, were bound up in close family attachments 
                    that encompassed <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs parents

               <div class="p"><span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> says that couriers could be engaged on the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span> but also in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> (specifically, No. 7, <span class="placeName-OLDCOMPTONST">Old Compton Street</span>, <span class="placeName-SOHO">Soho</span>; or No. 11, <span class="placeName-PANTONST">Panton Square</span>); 
                    and evidently <span class="persName-SALVADOR">Salvador</span> was based in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> mentions in <span class="date-1835-02">February 1835</span> that the courier visited <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> to help plan the route for the
