         <div class="p">The aim of this note is not to attempt an exhaustive listing of books that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> read or consulted in his youth. 
                    Information about <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s reading and its influences is available throughout <i>ERM</i>, 
                    in the apparatuses and glosses of works containing specific allusions to and borrowings from publications to which he was exposed. 
                    Especially influential authors and published sources, moreover, are discussed in notes of their own.

                    (i.e., lists of annual book purchases drawn from <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#RFMS28");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-RFMS28">Account Book, RF MS 28, <span class="date-1827-1845">1827&#x2013;45</span></span></a>);

            <span class="head-section">On Researching Ruskin&#x02BC;s Reading in His Youth</span>
            
            
            <div class="p">Regarding the Ruskin family&#x02BC;s ownership or consultation of a given title at a given time, a measure of uncertainty will always be attached to 
                        documentable evidence of its presence in the family library&#x2014;or for that matter, to the absence of such evidence. 
                        For example, the fact that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> purchased a book designed for youth does not necessarily mean it was intended for <span class="persName-JR">John</span>; 
                        some purchases may have been intended as gifts for <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s cousins, especially for 
                        <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/richardson_mary_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span> (<span class="date-1815-1849">1815&#x2013;49</span>)</a>, 
                        who lived with the Ruskin family from <span class="date-1828">1828</span> to her marriage in <span class="date-1848">1848</span>. While <span class="persName-JSD">James S. Dearden</span> comments about the family library that 
                        &#x201C;the books owned by all three Ruskins must be considered to be part of &#x2018;Ruskin&#x02BC;s Library&#x2019; because he ultimately inherited his parents&#x02BC; possessions, 
                        as well as having the use of them during their lifetimes&#x201D;, one wonders how far the availability, much less the inheritance, 
                        extended in the case of <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>&#x02BC;s books. <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span> is right to conclude with the caveat that, 
                        &#x201C;although <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s lifetime&#x02BC;s library was much greater than it was at any <i>one</i> time, 
                        we do not know its total extent&#x201D; (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-book-DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><i>Library of John Ruskin</i></span></a>, xv, xxiv). The most valuable evidence that <i>ERM</i> can contribute to the question of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s reading lies 
                        in the edited texts, which can reveal lexical traces of readings that may have left no material trace in the family record.</div>
            
            
            <div class="p">As <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span> remarks, in adulthood <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> &#x201C;was essentially . . . a book&#x2010;buyer rather than a book borrower or library user&#x201D; 
                        (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-book-DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><i>Library of John Ruskin</i></span></a>, xix), a habit that appears to have been inherited from his father, 
                        who was generous with purchases of books for his family&#x02BC;s education and entertainment. Still, there is no way of knowing 
                        whether publications that left their influence in the early manuscripts were borrowed or owned, 
                        if otherwise unrecorded as part of the family library in the <span class="date-1820-1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</span>. For example, 
                        <span class="persName-FDH">Felicia Hemans</span> was sufficiently admired for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> to have transcribed her poem, <span class="title-poem-HEMANSSOUNDOFTHESEA">&#x201C;The Sound of the Sea&#x201D;</span> (<span class="date-1826">1826</span>) in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIVB">MS IVB</span>, 
                        probably based on the text as published in the <span class="title-periodical-NEWMONTHLYMAGAZINE"><i>New Monthly Magazine</i></span>. He also adapted passages from <span class="persName-FDH">Hemans</span>&#x02BC;s long poem, 
                        <span class="title-poem-HEMANSRESTORATIONWORKSOFART"><i>The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy</i></span>, published by Murray in <span class="date-1816">1816</span>, for use in his own poem, <span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span>. 
                        Yet <span class="persName-FDH">Mrs. Hemans</span> is curiously absent from records of the Ruskins&#x02BC; book ownership, 
                        apart from poems included in literary annuals that the Ruskins are known to have owned. 
                        How publications by <span class="persName-FDH">Hemans</span> passed through their hands&#x2014;whether by purchase, borrowing, or just casually encountering a periodical outside the house&#x2014;will probably remain a mystery.</div>
            
            
            <div class="p">Borrowing could have provided a means for <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> to control what books entered the house. 
                        She appears to refer to borrowing, for example, when she writes to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> about the novel, 
                        <span class="title-book-BROOKEFOOLOFQUALITY"><i>The Fool of Quality</i></span> (<span class="date-1766-1772">1766&#x2013;72</span>) by <span class="persName-HBROOKE">Henry Brooke</span> (<span class="date-1703-1783">1703&#x2013;83</span>). Since she &#x201C;did not like&#x201D; the novel, 
                        she &#x201C;got the first volume merely to read the History of the three little fishes to <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x201D;. 
                        In this instance, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s renewed encounter with the novel led to &#x201C;the Almighty open&#x005B;ing&#x005D; the understanding&#x201D;, 
                        and she decided to &#x201C;read it together&#x201D; with <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>. Perhaps only then was the full work acquired for the household, 
                        perhaps in the abridgement of the novel by <span class="persName-JWESLEY">John Wesley</span> 
                        (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/mr_to_jjr_1826-05-15_al_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-mr_to_jjr_1826-05-15">Margaret to John James Ruskin, 15 May 1826</span></a>, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#RFL");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a> 145; <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span>, <span class="title-book-DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><i>The Library of John Ruskin</i></span></a>, 51 &#x005B;no. 336&#x005D;;

            <div class="p">On travels, the Ruskins supplemented books they brought with them by tapping resources along the way; for example, 
                        during the tour of <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span> in <span class="date-1833">1833</span>, when <span class="persName-JR">John</span> fell ill, his father and cousin <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> cheered him up by finding 
                        &#x201C;some English books from a library&#x201D; along with &#x201C;2 or 3 volumes of <span class="title-periodical-GALIGNANISMAGAZINE">Gagliani&#x02BC;s Magazine</span>&#x201D;&#x2014;that is, 
                        one of the periodicals issued by Librairie Galignani, the Paris&#x2010;based English&#x2010;language publisher, bookseller, and circulating library, 
                        which published two monthly journals, the <span class="title-periodical-GALIGNANIREPERTORY"><i>Repertory</i></span> (ca. <span class="date-1807-1825">1807&#x2013;25</span>), and 
                        <span class="title-periodical-GALIGNANISMAGAZINE"><i>Galignani&#x02BC;s Monthly Review and Magazine</i></span> (ca. <span class="date-1822-1825">1822&#x2013;25</span>), 
                        as well as a daily, the <span class="title-periodical-GALIGNANIMESSENGER"><i>Messenger</i></span> (ca. <span class="date-1814-1904">1814&#x2013;1904</span>). 
                        Galignani also published a series, <span class="title-series-STANDARDMODERNNOVELS"><i>Standard Modern Novels and Romances</i></span>, 
                        which supplied English travelers and expatriates with contemporary British poetry and prose. 
                        The editions were issued in duodecimo, a size convenient for travel, but printed using excellent type and engravings, 
                        and edited for correct and complete text&#x2014;in some cases, text more complete and reliable than what could be found in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> editions. 
                        As piracies, the volumes were priced significantly cheaper than corresponding <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> editions, 
                        and sold in paper&#x2010;covered boards&#x2014;volumes that could be shared among travelers at a hotel and left behind for others&#x02BC; enjoyment. 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did retain from boyhood one of Galignani&#x02BC;s outstanding volumes in the series 
                        (possibly obtained from a <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> seller rather than from abroad)&#x2014;<span class="title-book-POETICALWORKSETAL"><i>The Complete Poetical Works of Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats</i></span> (<span class="date-1829">1829</span>), 
                        an edition that, at the time of publication, was superior to any British edition of <span class="persName-PBS">Percy Shelley</span>, 
                        and the only edition of <span class="persName-JKEATS">Keats</span> available in collected form 
                        (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#RFT48");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-transcript-RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</span></a>, 106; 
                        <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#BARBERGALIGNANI");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-GBARBER">Barber</span>, <span class="title-essay-BARBERGALIGNANI">&#x201C;Galignani&#x02BC;s and the Publication of English Books in France&#x201D;</span></a>, 269, 284, 272&#x2013;74;

            <div class="p">Besides the possibility that books were borrowed, another kind of caveat should be applied to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s retrospective accounts of his boyhood reading. 
                        The authors and titles he mentions in the opening chapters of <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span> are not untrue to his early reading, 
                        but his account of how he both loved certain books and resisted others has charmed readers 
                        into fixating on a short list of titles that is potentially misleading. First, the list is highly selective&#x2014;contrasting, 
                        for dramatic effect, the enforced Sunday reading of <span class="persName-JBUNYAN">John Bunyan</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-BUNYANPILGRIMSPROGRESS"><i>Pilgrim&#x02BC;s Progress</i></span> and <span class="persName-DDEFOE">Daniel Defoe</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-DEFOEROBINSONCRUSOE"><i>Robinson Crusoe</i></span> 
                        with weekday &#x201C;reading of my own election&#x201D; of <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>&#x02BC;s novels and <span class="persName-HOMER">Homer</span> (<span class="persName-APOPE">Alexander Pope</span>&#x02BC;s translation of the <span class="title-poem-ILIAD">&#x201C;Iliad&#x201D;</span>)&#x2014;but, as shown in 
                        <a href="#DESCRIPTIONS">Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Youth</a>, these classics were mixed in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s juvenile library 
                        with works both secular and Sabbatarian that now seem much more ephemeral. Second, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s retrospection 
                        flattens these readings in time, suggesting that his study even of favored works was both simultaneous and compartmentalized. In fact, even if true that his reading was subject to this weekly division, 
                        his reading was also regulated by competing programs. Moreover, the books themselves and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s responses to them did not necessarily adhere to the categories assigned to them. 
                        As shown in <i>ERM</i> commentary and in the <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#RFL");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, the Ruskins, no less than other middle&#x2010;class families, attempted to follow 
                        the program of graduated, age&#x2010;appropriate reading for children as recommended by educationists like the Barbaulds and Edgeworths. 
                        Yet <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s writings in <i>ERM</i> also reflect his tendency to buck the program, by reading texts above his years 
                        (e.g., <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><i>Scientific Dialogues</i></span>, which he copied verbatim in <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I&#x201D;</span>, but which are too advanced for that context). 
                        Moreover, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and his mother shared weekday reading, in which the religious influences were likely more powerful and memorable to him 
                        (e.g., the <span class="persName-fictional-WHITELADY">White Lady</span> as a protector of Protestantism in <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY"><i>The Monastery</i></span>) than the Sunday sermons he attempted to copy.</div>

                        presumably because no letters are extant from that year, thus giving no occasion for annotation.

                        <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> often listed names of vendors as shorthand for the wares they supplied, 
                        as well as naming recipients of gifts or purchases. In many cases, it is mere speculation whether a proper name 
                        refers to purchase of a book or of some other kind of item, and these names are flagged as &#x201C;unidentified&#x201D;. 
                        Yet the occurence of some names can sometimes be aligned with other information to identify book titles and authors

                                    The responsibility for and circumstances of binding these three items as &#x201C;Fairy Tales&#x201D; are unknown. 
                                    This title on the spine applies most legitimately to the first of the items, <span class="title-anthology-MOTHERBUNCHSFAIRYTALES"><i>Mother Bunch&#x02BC;s Fairy Tales</i></span>, 
                                    whereas the other two items belong only marginally, each containing just one or two stories that feature a fairy or fantastical events. 
                                    Regardless of the consistency of the collection, however, an implicit rationale becomes apparent by comparing the contents of another bound collection, 
                                    <a href="#WIDOWDISCUSSION"><span class="title-binding_slipcase-WIDOWOFROSENEATHCOMP">&#x005B;The Widow of Roseneath etc.&#x005D;</span></a>,

                                    Besides their contents, the three items in <span class="title-binding_slipcase-FAIRYTALESSHARPCOLL">&#x201C;Fairy Tales&#x201D;</span> also notably have in common their publication by J. Lumsden and Son of Glasgow. 
                                    Now highly regarded among collectors, Lumsden&#x02BC;s children&#x02BC;s books are distinguished by 
                                    &#x201C;a certain trimness (primness one might almost call it) in the covers, the quality of the paper used, 
                                    the excellent type&#x2010;face, the occasional use of coloured inks for text and illustrations, 
                                    usually bistre or sanguine, occasionally green, and a few hand&#x2010;coloured illustrations&#x201D;. 
                                    In their own time, however, the books were apparently little known outside of <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>; 
                                    and even in their own country, they were not widely popular, because their prices were considered 
                                    rather dear, even at two pence or six pence per copy&#x2014;cheaper and less elegant chapbooks by this publisher 
                                    being more commonly found

                                            The Lumsden edition was a piracy and abridgement of an English edition 
                                            published in <span class="date-1802">1802</span> and <span class="date-1817">1817</span> by the <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> publisher of children&#x02BC;s books, John Harris; 
                                            and the Harris editions were in turn based on editions (ca. <span class="date-1773-1799">1773&#x2013;99</span>) published by the firm of John Newbery 
                                            (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#BLAMIRESMOTHERBUNCH");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-DBLAMIRES">Blamires</span>, <span class="title-essay-BLAMIRESMOTHERBUNCH">&#x201C;From Madame d&#x02BC;Aulnoy to Mother Bunch&#x201D;</span></a>, 75; and see

                                       Newbery originated the title, <span class="title-anthology-MOTHERBUNCHSFAIRYTALES"><i>Mother Bunch&#x02BC;s Fairy Tales</i></span>, and adapted an earlier English translation 
                                            (<span class="date-1721">1721</span>, reprinted frequently through <span class="date-1817">1817</span>, and including tales by other French salon writers). 
                                            This early eighteenth&#x2010;century English translation, according to <span class="persName-DBLAMIRES">David Blamires</span>, 
                                            was faithful to the original, sophisticated French tales and intended for adult readers. 
                                            The Newbery edition and its descendents simplified the texts for child readers, 
                                            and reassigned the authorship from <span class="persName-COUNTESSDAULNOY">Madame d&#x02BC;Aulnoy</span> to the fictitious Mother Bunch, 
                                            an English folklore figure whom children could imagine as a storyteller 
                                            similar to Mother Goose. Through these successive adaptations of the English texts 
                                            by Newbery, Harris, and Lumsden for an audience of middle&#x2010;class children&#x2014;as well as 
                                            through issues of individual tales in chapbook form for a working&#x2010;class audience&#x2014;the 
                                            French salon fairy tales came be regarded as English and traditional

                                            In the subtitle, first applied by Newbery and carried through the adaptations by Harris and Lumsden, 
                                            the specification that the tales were meant to amuse &#x201C;little masters and misses&#x201D; signals that the tales 
                                            were meant for younger children. For Newbery in the eighteenth century, the purpose of such books was 
                                            to teach children basic reading, as compared with books designated for &#x201C;young gentlemen and ladies&#x201D;, 
                                            which contained &#x201C;lessons of life&#x201D; (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#TOWNSENDNEWBERYTELESCOPE");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-JRT">Townsend</span>, <span class="title-essay-TOWNSENDNEWBERYTELESCOPE">&#x201C;John Newbery and Tom Telescope&#x201D;</span></a>, 82&#x2013;83).

                                            As pointed out in the &#x201C;Introductory Essay&#x201D; on the copy in the <span class="title-archive-SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALESHOCKLIFFE">Hockliffe Archive</span>, 
                                            the tales have no connection with Christmas, despite the anthology&#x02BC;s title, which presumably was a marketing ploy. 
                                            The text, which in some copies includes a description of the Seven Wonders of the World, 
                                            was apparently based on a collection first published in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, ca. <span class="date-1780">1780</span>

                                            The first story in the collection opens with commentary on the neglect of religion and morality in childhood education, 
                                            but the stories in themselves do little to redress this supposed failing. The collection is miscellaneous, 
                                            some tales teaching prudent and moral conduct, some adopting an oriental flavor, and only a few entailing magic or fairies. 
                                            Two of the latter sort feature dervises (i.e., dervishes), who reward hospitality with magical riches, but retract the reward and punish 
                                            characters who overstep boundaries owing to greed or excess curiosity.<br/><br/>

                                    The responsibility for binding these items together is unknown. A rationale, if not the specific occasion for the collection 
                                    can be inferred, however, if the binding of these eight items was made in concert with the binding of <a href="#FAIRYTALESDISCUSSION">Fairy Tales</a>. 
                                    As compared with the latter, the items collected here share an emphasis on &#x201C;cautionary&#x201D; tales (to draw on the subtitle of <span class="title-book-TURNERTHECOWSLIP"><i>The Cowslip</i></span>). 
                                    Since the early nineteenth century, such Romantic writers as <span class="persName-CLE">Charles Lamb</span>, <span class="persName-STC">S. T. Coleridge</span>, and <span class="persName-WW">William Wordsworth</span> 
                                    had polemically argued in favor of appealing to children&#x02BC;s imagination with fairy tales as opposed to training their reason and morals 
                                    with &#x201C;instructive&#x201D; and &#x201C;cautionary&#x201D; tales and dialogues by the &#x201C;cursed <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span> Crew&#x201D;, as <span class="persName-CLE">Lamb</span> anathematized this group largely of women writers. 
                                    In our time, critics have exposed the politics underpinning these divisions, but in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, 
                                    which was probably when a number of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s childhood books were divided between these two collections, the reputation of 
                                    <span class="persName-ALB">Anna Letitia Barbauld</span> had been disassociated from her politics and reduced to bland high&#x2010;mindedness&#x2014;a &#x201C;valuation&#x201D; 
                                    of this writing that suggests, as <span class="persName-WMCCARTHY">William McCarthy</span> complains, &#x201C;that it entirely lacked humor, irony, or wit&#x201D; 
                                    (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#MCCARTHYBARBAULDRECEPTION");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-WMCCARTHY">McCarthy</span>, <span class="title-essay-MCCARTHYBARBAULDRECEPTION">&#x201C;&#x2018;A High&#x2010;Minded Christian Lady&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></a>, 179; and see 
                                    <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#CLARKEBARBAULDCREW");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-NCLARKE">Clarke</span>, <span class="title-essay-CLARKEBARBAULDCREW">&#x201C;&#x2018;The Cursed Barbauld Crew&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></a>, 91&#x2013;93). 
                                    Such a valuation was perhaps implicitly placed on these eight items by binding them together.<br/><br/>
                                    
                                    The reductive valuation would not have been <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s, but it seems unlikely that he could have been responsible for binding this collection 
                                    since, as noted in the following descritions, he annotated some of the items separately, 
                                    bequeathing them to <span class="persName-JSAR">Joan Severn</span> and her children. One of the annotations is dated &#x201C;<span class="date-1889">1889</span>&#x201D;, and another &#x201C;<span class="date-1889-1890">1889&#x2013;1890</span>&#x201D;, 
                                    clues that the binding was ordered after <span class="date-1890">1890</span> by someone other than <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x2014;perhaps by <span class="persName-JSAR">Joan Severn</span>&#x2014;since by that time, 
                                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself would not have been in a mental state to take such an initiative.

                                            &#x201C;may be one of the volumes which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> mentioned he had lost&#x201D; (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-book-"><i>Library of John Ruskin</i></span></a>, 8 &#x005B;no. 34&#x005D;, and see cviii&#x2013;cxii). 
                                            This possibility is ruled out, however, since the <span class="persName-FJS">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> copy, which is a six&#x2010;volumes&#x2010;in&#x2010;one edition, complete in itself, cannot have formed a part of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s original set.<br/><br/>
                                       
                                       <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span> gives <span class="date-1792">1792</span> as the year of publication for the <span class="persName-FJS">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> copy, but this date is not supported by the title page, which is undated. 
                                            Its publication by J. F.

                                            the details do not match the <span class="persName-JFS">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> copy, which lacks a publication date as well as the series title, <span class="title-series-DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">&#x201C;English Classics&#x201D;</span>, on the title page. 
                                            Instead, the <span class="persName-FJS">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> copy identifies itself as &#x201C;Printed and Published by <span class="persName-JFDOVE">J.

                                            According to <span class="persName-LWORMS">Laurence Worms</span>, this imprint, &#x201C;Printed and Published by <span class="persName-JFDOVE">J. F.

                                            &#x201C;within a couple of years&#x201D; of the <span class="date-1823-1826">mid&#x2010;1820s</span> series but no later than <span class="date-1833">1833</span> when <span class="persName-JFDOVE">Dove</span> retired

Perhaps the &#x201C;Published and Printed&#x201D; imprint&#x2014;accompanied by a device of a dove bearing an olive branch, 
                                            and the motto &#x201C;perseverantia et amicis &#x005B;perseverance and friendship&#x005D;&#x201D;&#x2014;represented an advance beyond acting only as a printer for large shareholding publisher groups. 
                                            In any case, even if the <span class="persName-JFS">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> copy were the <span class="date-1827">1827</span> <span class="title-series-DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">&#x201C;English Classics&#x201D;</span> version of <span class="title-booK-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span>, 
                                            and not a later edition under <span class="persName-JFDOVE">Dove</span>&#x02BC;s house imprint, a publication date of <span class="date-1827">1827</span> is in itself too late for a book 
                                            assumed to have served as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s foundational boyhood reading, preceding his study of <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHFRANK"><i>Frank</i></span> and <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span>. 
                                            As <span class="persName-NLIGHTMAN">Naomi Lightman</span> comments, &#x201C;as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s copy has no date, we cannot know when it was purchased&#x201D;

                                            if not presented as a volume in the <span class="title-series-DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">&#x201C;English Classics&#x201D;</span> series&#x2014;would have postdated <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s writing that <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span> most directly inspired,

                                            In an analysis of the publishing history of <span class="title-book-AIKENBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span>, 
                                            <span class="persName-AFYFE">Aileen Fyfe</span> explains that, <span class="date-1792-1823">from 1792 until 1823</span>, the text of the first edition was controlled by the first publisher, <span class="persName-JJPUBLISHER">Joseph Johnson</span>, 
                                            his successor Rowland Hunter, and other publishers to whom Hunter sold shares. In <span class="date-1823">1823</span>, to maintain copyright, the shareholders solicited 
                                            a corrected and slightly expanded edition from <span class="persName-JAIKIN">John Aikin</span>&#x02BC;s son, <span class="persName-AAIKIN">Arthur Aikin</span>, which was published as the thirteenth edition, apparently in six volumes; 
                                            and in <span class="date-1826">1826</span>, an edition rearranged by <span class="persName-JAIKIN">John Aikin</span>&#x02BC;s daughter, <span class="persName-LAIKIN">Lucy Aikin</span>, was published in four volumes. Despite these new editions descending from the original,
                                            &#x201C;from the <span class="date-1823-1826">mid&#x2010;1820s</span>&#x201D;, <span class="persName-AFYFE">Fyfe</span> notes, &#x201C;any publisher could print the original text of <span class="title-book-AIKENBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span>, and a number did so&#x201D;, including 
                                            provincial and Scottish publishers (<span class="persName-AFYFE">Fyfe</span>, <span class="title-essay-FYFECOPYRIGHTS">&#x201C;Copyrights and Competition&#x201D;</span>, 40). If <span class="persName-JFDOVE">Dove</span> waited until <span class="date-1827">1827</span> to reprint <span class="title-book-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings</i></span>, even in its original text, 
                                            he already lagged behind some other publishers.<br/><br/>
                                            
                                            The Ruskins would have entered the market for <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s initial copy of <span class="title-book-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span> 
                                            during the transitional period in the book&#x02BC;s publishing history, between the <span class="date-1820-1826">early&#x2010; and mid&#x2010;1820s</span>, when the Aikins were revising the text in order to extend copyright, 
                                            and when other publishers were issuing reprints of the first edition. At this point, the Ruskins would likely have acquired either the new edition of <span class="date-1823">1823</span> or afterward, 
                                            whose shareholder publishers included (since <span class="date-1815">1815</span>) Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy, who also published the Ruskins&#x02BC; editions of <span class="persName-ME">Maria Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-series-EDGEWORTHEARLYLESSONS">&#x201C;Early Lessons&#x201D;</span> series; 
                                            or they would have purchased a first&#x2010;edition reprint available from non&#x2010;shareholder publishers. At that time, those non&#x2010;shareholder reprints 
                                            would not have included <span class="persName-JFDOVE">Dove</span>&#x02BC;s, since available evidence shows him coming late to the game. Consequently, putting aside the <span class="persName-FJS">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> <span class="persName-JFDOVE">Dove</span> edition&#x2014;undated, but probably after <span class="date-1827">1827</span>&#x2014;we 
                                            cannot determine what state of the text of <span class="title-book-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span> was availble to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in his boyhood six&#x2010;volume version, whether the revised edition by <span class="persName-AAIKIN">Arthur Aikin</span> or the original descended from the <span class="persName-JJPUBLISHER">Johnson</span>/Hunter shareholders (or even as originally published by <span class="persName-JJPUBLISHER">Johnson</span>/Hunter). 
                                            A good bet may be the revised text of <span class="date-1823">1823</span>, since the shareholders carrying that text, including Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy,produced substantial print runs that sold well 
                                                (see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#FYFECOPYRIGHTS");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-AFYFE">Fyfe</span>, <span class="title-essay-FYFECOPYRIGHTS">&#x201C;Copyrights and Competition&#x201D;</span></a>, 43); and the Ruskins were familiar with Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy 
                                                from their purchase of <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHFRANK"><i>Frank</i></span> and <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span>. 
                                                Definitive evidence, however, must await recovery of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s three stray volumes, as rebound by Simpson.<br/><br/>
                                            
                                            As for the <span class="persName-FJS">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> copy, since it contains annotations by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> from later years, a logical conclusion may be that he acquired this <span class="persName-JFDOVE">Dove</span> edition at some point to replace the lost volumes of his boyhood set, 
                                            at or before the time of sending the surviving copies for rebinding; or, if the <span class="persName-JFDOVE">Dove</span> reprint was a more youthful acquisition, it should be treated as an additional household copy, circa <span class="date-1830">1830</span>. 
                                            While the front endpaper contains illegible scrawls, one of which <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> was tempted to make out to be the letter <i>J</i> and interpret as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s earliest signature, 
                                            all the legible marginalia is in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s mature hand.
