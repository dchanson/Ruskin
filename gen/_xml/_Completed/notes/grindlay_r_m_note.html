         <div class="p"><span class="persName-RMG">Grindlay</span> was an amateur artist, whose drawings formed the basis of engravings and aquatints published by . 
                    <span class="persName-RMG">Grindlay</span>&#x02BC;s major book, <span class="title-book-GRINDLAYINDIA"><i>Scenery, Costumes and Architecture, Chiefly on the Western Side of India</i></span>, 
                    which contained thirty&#x2010;six aquatint prints (not all of them based on <span class="persName-RMG">Grindlay</span>&#x02BC;s drawings), was published between <span class="date-1826-1830">1826 and 1830</span>. 
                    Its first two parts were produced by <span class="persName-RAP">Rudolph Ackermann</span>, and its remaining four parts by Smith, Elder. 
                    A sketch by <span class="persName-RMG">Grindlay</span>from travel in <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> also was worked into an engraving for Smith, Elder&#x02BC;s annual, 
                    <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/friendships_offering_note.php");?>" target="_self">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</a>, in <span class="date-1830">1830</span> (see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus.php#DISCUSSION");?>" target="_self">Saltzburg: Discussion</a>).</div>
         
         
         <div class="p">From <span class="date-1803">1803</span>, <span class="persName-RMG">Grindlay</span> served in the East India Company&#x02BC;s military service (Bombay Native Infantry), and in other official positions, 
                    which enabled him to travel extensively throughout western <span class="placeName-INDIA">India</span> and record the sights in sketches. 
                    Returning to <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span> in <span class="date-1817">1817</span> and retiring from the service in <span class="date-1820">1820</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-RMG">Grindlay</span> founded a <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> agency, Leslie &#x0026; Grindlay, in <span class="date-1828">1828</span>, which managed shipping and passenger travel to and from <span class="placeName-INDIA">India</span>. 
                    The agency, which eventually grew into the major Anglo&#x2010;Indian banking firm named for him, Grindlay&#x02BC;s, was originally situated in Birchin Lane, 
                    near the second location of Smith, Elder, at 65, Cornhill 
                    (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#ROHATGIPARLETTINDIANLIFE");?>" target="_self"> <span class="persName-PROHATGI">Rohatgi</span> and <span class="persName-GPARLETT">Parlett</span>, <span class="title-book-ROHATGIPARLETTINDIANLIFE"><i>Indian Life and Landscape by Western Artists</i></span></a>, 213&#x2013;16; 
                    <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#ROHATGIAMATEURARTISTS");?>" target="_self"> <span class="persName-PROHATGI">Rohatgi</span>, <span class="title-periodical-ROHATGIAMATEURARTISTS">&#x201C;Amateur Artists in Western India&#x201D;</span></a>, 26&#x2013;31). 
                    As both Leslie &#x0026; Grindlay and Smith, Elder dealt in Anglo&#x2010;Indian travel and trade, it seems likely that <span class="persName-RMG">Grindlay</span> and <span class="persName-AE">Alexander Elder</span> were brought together 
                    by their shared artistic as well as business interests.</div>
         
         
         <div class="p">The production of Scenery, Costumes and Architecture, closely supervised by <span class="persName-RMG">Grindlay</span>, drew on a small army of artists, engravers, and aquatint specialists 
                    (some of whom, such as the artists <span class="persName-WDANIELL">William Daniell</span> and <span class="persName-WPPAINTER">William Purser</span>, also produced work for Smith, Elder&#x02BC;s <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>). 
                    The publication must have marked a significant milestone for Smith, Elder&#x02BC;s comparatively young publishing division, since <span class="persName-PROHATGI">Pauline Rohatgi</span> rates the work 
                    &#x201C;among the finest illustrated books ever produced&#x201D;, achieving a &#x201C;perfection of the aquatint printing process&#x201D;, which was notable in this case for 
                    &#x201C;an unusually wide range of coloured inks used in the actual printing, with the result that hardly any additional hand&#x2010;colouring was needed to complete the effect&#x201D;
