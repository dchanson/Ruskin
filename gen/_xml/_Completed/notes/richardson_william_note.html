                    expense, especially from the time when they were orphaned by the death of their mother (<span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs sister), <a href="/notes/richardson_jessie_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-JRP">Jessie Richardson</span> (<span class="date-1783-11-20-1828-05-18">1783–1828</span>)</a> of <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>. 
                    Unlike <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>, he did not live at <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> with the Ruskins. 
                    <span class="persName-JRPSONWILLIAM">William</span> trained as a physician, later becoming the Ruskin family medical advisor; 
                    and he established a prominent practice in <span class="placeName-TUNBRIDGEWELLS">Tunbridge Wells</span>, ultimately leaving a mark on diabetes research, 
                    according to <span class="persName-VAB">Van Akin Burd</span>ʼs biographical note (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a> 51–52 n. 3).</div>
               
               <div class="p">In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs youth, <span class="persName-JRPSONWILLIAM">William</span> seemed less promising to the Ruskins, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> wondering, “will he ever do for a Doctor”, 
                    skeptical that “he could get thro the latin classes” considering the limited “knowledge of the english” contained 
                    in one of his letters: “he must be thoroughly stupid but he may be the reverse of <span class="persName-KC2">King Charles</span> and we may hope 
                    may never do a stupid thing thoʼ he never either writes or says a wise one” (referring to the quip about <span class="persName-KC2">Charles II</span> 
                    by <span class="persName-JWEARLROCHESTER2">John Wilmot, the earl of Rochester</span>, that the king “never said a foolish thing, / Nor ever did a wise one”

                    <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> admitted, however, that <span class="persName-">William</span> “is certainly goodnatured and obliging”, 
                    and hoped he “may come to the use of his understanding in time”

                    Later, she decided that the “very dullness of his faculties in childhood has induced such habits of constant 
                    laborious study as will at least place him on an equality if he does not go beyond many of far higher genius”
