                        Of French manufacture in <span class="placeName-LYONS">Lyon</span> (the family passing through the city between the revolts by silk‐workers in <span class="date-1831">1831</span> and <span class="date-1834">1834</span>), <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> noted how 
                        “smoky & black” and crowded the tenements were. Yet he was also capable of comparing the French weavers favorably with their British counterparts: 
                        “Amongst our poor weavers there is everything to depress to degrade to debauch & brutalize,”,
                        whereas “the objects round” the French workers—the “grander Houses the distant <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> the clear blue sky”—perhaps exert 
                        “an Influence on the taste of these Artisans that will make their productions eternally superior in Beauty to ours”

                        these topical issues emerge in passing, but the work is largely untroubled by modern turmoil. 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> mentions battlefields, but his references tend to be unspecific, as likely medieval as modern. He prefers the picturesque over the political, 
                        the emphasis reflecting how, in the <span class="date-1820-1839">1820s–30s</span>, views of northern <span class="geogName-EUROPE">Europe</span> were opened up as vividly by artists and poets as by military news. 
                        It is striking how <span class="persName-FMT">Mrs. Trollope</span>, traveling through the region in the same year as the Ruskins, describes scenes by referencing the artist

                        is like looking over a portfolio of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>ʼs best drawings”. She recognizes the  
                        “mellowed tints of red and grey” in <span class="placeName-HUY">Huy</span> as having been “so dear to <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>”

                        To traverse the region, the Ruskins would have received only limited help from the recently updated guidebook by <span class="persName-MSA">Mariana Starke</span> 
                        that they probably carried; nonetheless, they managed to follow a path similar to that taken in <span class="date-1821">1821</span> by <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>,
