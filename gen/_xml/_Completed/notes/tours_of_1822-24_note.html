                    coming from <span class="placeName-LEICESTER">Leicester</span> to <span class="placeName-STAMFORD">Stamford</span>, where they stayed at the ancient <span class="placeName-GEORGEINN">George Inn</span>.
                    In reply, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> referred briefly to a holiday in the <span class="persName-KENT">Kent</span> seaside town of <span class="placeName-SANDGATE">Sandgate</span>

                    eloquently describes the charms of the “beautiful Ride . . . , differing from if not excelling all other Rides”, between
                    <span class="placeName-WARWICK">Warwick</span> and <span class="placeName-COVENTRY">Coventry</span> and including <span class="placeName-KENILWORTH">Kenilworth</span>, which he
                    hopes “to view . . . with my Love some summers day” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 118). 
                    That the family did undertake a tour in <span class="date-1822">1822</span>, perhaps sometime between 
                    <span class="date-1822-05-1822-09">May and September</span>, is supported by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs
                    remark to <a href="/notes/prout_samuel_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-SP">Samuel Prout (<span class="date-1783-1852">1783–1852</span>)</span></a>, 
                    albeit made over two decades later in a letter of <span class="date-1844-04-29">29 April 1844</span>, 
                    that he had been ‘born <i>again</i>, <span class="date-1822-02-08-1823-02-07">at three years old</span>’, among the
                    <span class="geogName-CUMBERLANDHLS">Cumberland Hills</span> (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 38:339)—the remark thus 
                    adding a religious association to experiences that his <span class="persName-JJR">father</span>ʼs <span class="date-1822">1822</span> letter had characterized 
                    solely in terms of the picturesque.</div>
               
               <div class="p">If a tour comprising the <span class="geogName-MIDLANDS">Midlands</span> and <span class="placeName-CUMBERLAND">Cumberland</span> seems ambitious enough for a family with a three‐year‐old, 
                    the itinerary may have extended to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>, 
                    as <span class="persName-VAB">Van Akin Burd</span> points out. According to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> writing decades later in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, 
                    this leg of the journey was reached by water:
                    “I had gone to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> in <span class="name--SPINKSCUTTER"><span class="persName-CS">Captain Spinks</span>ʼs cutter</span>, then a regular passage boat, when I was only
                    <span class="date-1822-02-08-1823-02-07">three years old</span>” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 35:105; 
                    see also <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 119–20 n. 1).</div>
               
               <div class="p">It is possible that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was referring to a steam cutter, since steam travel for passengers and tourism had been available in <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> since <span class="date-1812">1812</span>, 
                    when the first commercial steamboat in <span class="geogName-EUROPE">Europe</span>, the <i>Comet</i>, began operating on the <span class="geogName-CLYDERIVER">Clyde River</span>. Soon steam vessels were navigating west to east, 
                    from <span class="placeName-GLASGOW">Glasgow</span> on the <span class="geogName-CLYDERIVER">Clyde</span>, through the <span class="geogName-FORTHCLYDECANAL">Forth and Clyde Canal</span>, 
                    and then on the <span class="geogName-FORTHRIVER">Forth River</span> to <span class="placeName-LEITH">Leith</span>. From that point, <span class="geogName-CLYDERIVER">Clyde</span> 
                    steamers began making their way down the east coast to the south. Of the 141 steam vessels 
                    built in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span> by <span class="date-1822">1822</span>, 23 operated off the east coast of <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>

               <div class="p">Whether the Ruskinsʼ journey was by steam or sail, 
                    a journey to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> by water was not unlikely, 
                    since trade conditions during the <span class="date-1799-11-09-1815-06-18">Napoleonic War</span> encouraged the development of company‐owned “lines” of coastal vessels 
                    in competition with independent vessels—one such company being especially germane to the Ruskinsʼ northern destination, 
                    the Dundee, <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> & <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> Shipping Company, which carried passengers as well as cargo. 
                    Scholarship on this line includes mention of a <span class="persName-SPINKS">Captain Spinks</span> who, like many of the experienced captains chosen to effect the companyʼs transition from sail to steam, 
                    had difficulties maneuvering the comparatively unmanageable steam “smacks” (i.e., coastal cutters). This <span class="persName-SPINKS">Spinks</span> 
                    was formally admonished for repeatedly incurring damage to his steam smack, the <span class="placeName-PERTH"><i>Perth</i></span>, throughout <span class="date-1836-1837">1836–37</span>, 
                    owing to collisions that included running over an oyster fishing smack

               <div class="p">There is in addition a tradition that the family visited the <span class="geogName-LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</span> in <span class="date-1824">1824</span> 
                    (see, e.g., <a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 1:xxv). 
                    This journey may be associated with one to <a href="/notes/perth_note" target="_self"><span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span></a> since 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs uncle, <a href="/notes/richardson_patrick_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-PR">Patrick Richardson</span></a>,
                    died on <span class="date-1824-07-20">July 20 of that year</span>, although a family tour may have been underway or even completed by that date.</div>
