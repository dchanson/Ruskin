               <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span>ʼs cousin, daughter of <a href="/notes/richardson_jessie_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-JRP">Janet (“Jessie”)</span></a> and <a href="/notes/richardson_patrick_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-PR">Patrick</span></a> Richardson of <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>.
                    For her life dates, see <a href="/notes/bibliography#SCOTTISHHERITAGE" target="_self"><span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span>, <span class="title-book-SCOTTISHHERITAGE"><i>Scottish Heritage</i></span></a>, 184, 185.
                    She married <span class="persName-PBOLDING">Parker Bolding</span>, a lawyer, in <span class="date-1848">1848</span> (<a href="/notes/bibliography#HILTONRUSKINEARLYYEARS" target="_self"><span class="persName-THILTON">Hilton</span>, <span class="title-book-HILTONRUSKINEARLYYEARS"><i>John Ruskin: The Early Years</i></span></a>, 112).</div>
               
               <div class="p">In <span class="date-1826">1826</span>, following the death by consumption of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs cousin, <a href="/notes/richardson_james_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-JRPSON">James Richardson</span></a>, who had lived at <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span>, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> declared a ban on
                    “bringing ourselves under such responsibility” by adopting relativesʼ children into the household 
                    (<span class="title-letter-">Margaret to John James Ruskin, <span class="date-1826-05-15">15 May 1826</span></span>). 
                    Nonetheless, one year later, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> expressed “how great a relief” she felt owing to the arrangements for <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span>ʼs sister, <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> to live
                    at <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> for at least some extended periods of time 
                    (<span class="persName-JR">John</span> referring, e.g., to having “changed very much in my lessons for while <span class="persName-MRC">mary</span> was with me I said them very ill every day”). 
                    Perhaps <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> was led to this exception by <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>ʼs gender and personality, since in the same letter 
                    she conveyed to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> her satisfaction in having a female companion, a <span class="persName-DEPREE">Miss DePree</span>, to stay with her “while you are away” on business travel, 
                    “and it seems to be her real desire to make herself useful and spare me trouble” in such tasks as sewing and shopping. <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> 
                    may have been viewed in the same capacity 
                    (<span class="title-letter-">Margaret to John James Ruskin, <span class="date-1827-04-28">28 April 1827</span></span>; 
                    <span class="title-letter-">John to John James Ruskin, <span class="date-1827-05">May 1827</span></span>, in 
                    <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 144, 156, 157, 157 n. 2).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Nonetheless, boundaries were maintained, as <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> was kept at school, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> reporting in <span class="date-1827-05">May 1827</span> having only “seen her twice”. 
                    An even harder line was drawn separating <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> from the Richardsons of Croydon, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> remarking that her sister, 
                    <span class="persName-BR">Bridget Richardson</span>, felt “much mortification that <span class="persName-MBR">Mary</span> [i.e., apparently her daughter, <span class="persName-MBR">Mary Bridget Richardson</span>] 
                    is not to have her home with us” and “seems hurt that I should feel her child such a burden”. 
                    (Had expectations for <span class="persName-MBR">Mary Bridget</span> of <span class="placeName-CROYDON">Croydon</span> even been usurped by arrangements for <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> of <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>?)
                    <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> confessed herself unequal to liberal demands on her affections, for “had I the love for hers [<span class="persName-BR">Bridget</span>ʼs children] 
                    she has for mine it would have been very different”. <span class="persName-BR">Bridget</span>ʼs more capacious affections were “natural” given her “love for society”, 
                    but <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> needed a more limited and, one suspects, socially stratified circle, and she concluded these remarks that she 
                    “continue[d] to find <span class="persName-DEPREE">Miss DePree</span> a most desirable companion” 
                    (<span class="title-letter-">Margaret to John James Ruskin, <span class="date-1827-05-08">8 May 1827</span></span>, in

                    A year later, following the death of the <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>ʼs mother, <a href="/notes/richardson_jessie_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-JRP">Jessie Richardson</span></a>, in <span class="date-1828-05-01-1828-05-31">May 1828</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>ʼs residence at <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> became permanent until her marriage.</div>
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>ʼs permanent residence had begun by <span class="date-1829-01">January 1829</span>, when <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> refers to <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> returning to school 
                    (<span class="title-letter-">Margaret to John James Ruskin, <span class="date-1829-01-21">21 January 1829</span></span>). 
                    Arrangements for <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>ʼs schooling appear in the earliest surviving household accounts kept by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, the ledger pages for <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, 
                    which record a total payment for the year of £62.11.10 to <span class="persName-MISSW">Miss Williamson</span>. 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFMS28" target="_self">Account Book</a>, 4v). 
                    <span class="persName-VAB">Van Akin Burd</span> was unable to locate a school listing operated by a <span class="persName-MISSW">Miss Williamson</span> in directories, but quotes an <span class="date-1830">1830</span> letter by <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> to a cousin, 
                    describing a small school limited to twelve boarders and a few day scholars, “most of them . . . Scotch”. The tuition consisted 
                    “Music, Drawing, and French;—and Geography, Dancing, Writing, and Arithmetic for two quarters”, and “latterly . . . Italian” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 164 n. 3). 
                    In <span class="date-1827-05">May 1827</span>, at the start of this tuition, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> reported that <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> “had not one bad mark for want of punctuallity and for all she is learning generally good ones” 
                    (<span class="title-letter-">Margaret to John James Ruskin, <span class="date-1827-05-08">8 May 1827</span></span>, in 
                    <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 162).</div>
               
               <div class="p">In <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs accounts, support of <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>ʼs schooling is easily confused with the same support for <span class="persName-MBR">Mary Bridget Richardson</span> of <span class="placeName-CROYDON">Croydon</span>. 
                    If the Ruskins refused to bring <span class="persName-MBR">Mary Bridget</span> into the family, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> did pay for her schooling, and she may have been <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>ʼs schoolmate 
                    at <span class="persName-MISSW">Miss Williamson</span>ʼs. In the same <span class="date-1829-01">January 1829</span> in which <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> mentions <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>ʼs resumption of school, she comments that she shall also 
                    “send” <span class="persName-MBR">Bridget</span> “instantly to school”; and in <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs accounts for <span class="date-1828">1828</span>, a yearʼs payments totaling £83.6.5 to <span class="persName-MISSW">Miss Williamson</span> 
                    are listed under the heading <span class="persName-MRC">“Mary Richardson Croydon”</span>, while for <span class="date-1828-11">November</span> of thqt year a single payment of £19.6 is listed for 
                    “Mary Schoolg” under the heading “<span class="persName-JRPSONELDEST">John</span>, <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>, <span class="persName-JRPSONANDREW">And[re]w</span>, & <span class="persName-JRPSONWILLIAM">Will[ia]m Richardson</span> [of <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>]”. (Accounting for the discrepancy of less schooling for 
                    <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span>, she would have returned to <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> that year in mourning for her mother.) For <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs accounts show a single entry 
                    in <span class="date-1829-03">March</span> of £38.7.1 for <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Bridget Richardson</span>ʼs “June Schoolg”, and two entries (in <span class="date-1826-06">June</span> and <span class="date-1829-12">December</span>) 
                    of £22.9.6 and £23.11.9 for <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span>ʼs “Schoolg”. The accounts for <span class="date-1830">1830</span> record nothing for <span class="persName-MBR">Mary Bridget</span>ʼs education, 
                    while <span class="persName-MISSW">Miss Williamson</span>ʼs name appears twice under the heading “<span class="persName-JRPSONELDEST">John</span>, <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>, <span class="persName-JRPSONANDREW">And[re]w</span>, & <span class="persName-JRPSONWILLIAM">Will[ia]m Richardson</span> [of <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>]”. There the girlsʼ education apparently ended; 
                    for in <span class="date-1831">1831</span>, the Ruskins were abroad for much of the year, and nothing is listed for the girlsʼ schooling in <span class="date-1832">1832</span>
