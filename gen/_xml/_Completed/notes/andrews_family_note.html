                    this celebrated Congregationalist preacher, who was the Ruskinsʼ clergyman when they attended Dissenting chapel, and who served as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs first tutor, 
                    instructing him from age ten in Latin and Greek. <span class="persName-">Andrews</span> and his wife <span class="persName-EHSA">Elizabeth</span> (<span class="date-1792-1831"> 1792–1831</span>) bore twelve children, of whom the eldest daughter, <span class="persName-">Eliza</span> (<span class="date-1816-1892"> 1816–92</span>), 
                    appears to have had some connection with the Ruskins during <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs youth. Elizaʼs younger sister, <span class="persName-EAP">Emily Augusta</span> (<span class="date-1824-1862">1824–62</span>), 
                    married <span class="persName-CKDP">Coventry Patmore</span> (<span class="date-1823-1896">1823–96</span>) and became known as the eponymous heroine of <span class="persName-CKDP">Patmore</span>ʼs <span class="title-poem-PATMOREANGEL"><i>Angel in the House</i></span>.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">In <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> mentions the sisters together: “<span class="persName-EAO">Miss Andrews</span>, the eldest sister of the ‘Angel in the House’, was an extremely beautiful girl of seventeen; 
                    she sang <span class="title-poem-BYRONTAMBOURGI">‘Tambourgi, Tambourgi’</span> with great spirit and a rich voice, went at blackberry time on rambles with us at the <span class="placeName-building-NORWOODSPA">Norwood Spa</span>, 
                    and made me feel generally that there was something in girls that I did not understand, and that was curiously agreeable”. 
                    As noted by the editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>, <span class="persName-EAO">Eliza</span>, as Mrs. <span class="persName-CO">Charles Orme</span>, maintained a salon, which was frequented by the Pre‐Raphaelites

               <div class="p">Some verse by <span class="persName-EAO">Eliza</span>, <span class="title-poem-ANDREWSELIZABRAVEHUSSAR">“The Brave Hussar”</span>, was copied by 
                    <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <a href="/apparatuses/msvi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span></a>. 
                    The eldest son, <span class="persName-EASON">Edward</span>, contributed poetry to his fatherʼs short‐lived periodical, <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span>, 
                    which was also the venue for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs first published poems 
                    (see <a href="/apparatuses/on_skiddaw_and_derwentwater_apparatus#DISCUSSION" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER">“On Skiddaw and Derwent Water”: Discussion</span></a>.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">A daughter of <span class="persName-EAO">Eliza</span> and <span class="persName-CO">Charles Orme</span> (ca. <span class="date-1807-1893">1807–93</span>, also named <span class="persName-EO">Eliza Orme</span> (<span class="date-1848-1937">1848–1937</span>), earned the degree of LLB from the University of London 
                    and was a practicing lawyer, as well as a feminist and writer on womenʼs issues. Her relevance to <i>ERM</i> 
                    lies in her sharing a rare copy of her grandfatherʼs magazine, the <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span>, 
                    with <span class="persName-HRN">H. Robertson Nicoll</span>, enabling him to track down <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs first publications, the two poems that appeared in its pages in <span class="date-1829">1829</span> and <span class="date-1830">1830</span> (see 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/on_skiddaw_and_derwentwater_apparatus#REDISCOVERYBYNICOLL" target="_self">“On Skiddaw and Derwent Water”: <span class="persName-HRN">Nicoll</span>ʼs Discovery of the <i>Spiritual Times</i> Ruskin Publications</a>). 
                    Since <span class="persName-EO">Eliza Orme</span> was unmarried and lived with her parents until their deaths in <span class="date-1892">1892</span> and <span class="date-1893">1893</span> (<a href="/notes/bibliography#ORMEDNB" target="_self"><span class="persName-LHOWSAM">Howsam</span>, <span class="title-essay-ORMEDNB">“Orme, Eliza [<span class="date-1848-1937">1848–1937</span>]”</span></a>), 
                    she perhaps was custodian of this legacy of her grandfather. <span class="persName-HRN">Nicoll</span> published his findings in <span class="date-1895">1895</span>.
