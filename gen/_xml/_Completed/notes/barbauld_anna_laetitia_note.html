               <div class="p">Educationist, poet, and writer for children. With her brother, the physician and writer, <span class="persName-JAIKIN">John Aikin</span> (<span class="date-1747-1822">1747–1822</span>), <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span> was a member of an intellectual Dissenter circle 
                    including the Edgeworths, <span class="persName-ED">Erasmus Darwin</span>, and others, whose influence as educationists remained widespread during <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs youth, 
                    and whose poems, stories, and lessons in dialogue form are reflected in his early reading and writing. 
                    These influences were admissible to the Ruskin household despite the politics of this circle. 
                    During the <span class="date-1789-05-05-1799-11-09">Revolutionary</span> and 
                    <span class="date-1799-11-09-1815-06-18">Napoleonic</span> periods, 
                    <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span> espoused progressive causes that would have alarmed the Ruskins. 
                    However, in the memoir and selection of works by <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>, published in <span class="date-1825">1825</span> by her niece, <span class="persName-LAIKIN">Lucy Aikin</span>, 
                    a Victorian sanitizing was begun that distanced <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>ʼs feminism from <span class="persName-MWG">Wollstonecraft</span> radicalism and 
                    associated her writing most strongly with her works for children—a process of reception that, in the view of <span class="persName-WMCCARTHY">William McCarthy</span>, 
                    gradually hollowed out her significance over the course of the nineteenth century, diminishing the reception of her poetry and prose writing for adults
