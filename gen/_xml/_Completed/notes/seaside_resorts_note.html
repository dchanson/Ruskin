               <div class="p">The Ruskins frequented seaside resorts during <span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span>ʼs youth, which coincided with a period of expansion for coastal settlements 
                    that could provide amenities for visitors seeking health and recreation through sea bathing. The growth in fashionable seaside resorts 
                    began in the eighteenth century as an extension of the established season for inland spas such as <span class="placeName-CITYOFBATH">Bath</span> and <span class="placeName-TUNBRIDGEWELLS">Tunbridge Wells</span>. 
                    In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, seaside resorts prospered by the incursion of the professional and well‐to‐do 
                    merchant classes, like the Ruskins, into what had been primarily the pleasures and benefits of the elite. As Londoners, the Ruskins patronized the resorts within easy reach 
                    along the southeast coast, such as <span class="placeName-SANDGATE">Sandgate</span> and <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> 
                    (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT" target="_self"><span class="persName-JKW">Walton</span>, <span class="title-book-WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT"><i>The English Seaside Resort</i></span></a>, 6–9, 20, 48).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">The Ruskins also took advantage of the inland mineral‐spring spas, especially <span class="placeName-TUNBRIDGEWELLS">Tunbridge Wells</span>. 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs cousin, <a href="/notes/richardson_william_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-">William Richardson</span> (<span class="date-1811-07-26-1875-09-18">1811–75</span></a>), 
                    was a physician at <span class="placeName-TUNBRIDGEWELLS">Tunbridge Wells</span> from <span class="date-1853">1853</span> until his retirement in <span class="date-1868">1868</span>. In <span class="date-1841">1841</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was sent to take the water cure at <span class="placeName-LEAMINGTON">Leamington Spa</span>, which,
                    according to <span class="persName-JKW">Walton</span>, was exceptional as a late bloomer among <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>ʼs inland spas when the public was being drawn increasingly to the seaside

                        but she advised caution. He should “try cautiously the sea”, “tak[ing] but one plunge 
                        come out instantly rub yourself perfectly dry and if you should feel no cold nor headake try it again 
                        at the interval of the day”. If this experiment made him “sensible of benefit”, 
                        <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> urged, then <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> should “stay [at] the seaside as long as business will permit” in order to strengthen his health

                        <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs advice closely mirrors a passage of text found in <a href="/notes/bibliography#BUCHANDOMESTICMEDICINE1791" target="_self"><span class="title-book-BUCHANDOMESTICMEDICINE1791"><i>Domestic Medicine</i></span></a> 
                        by the <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span> physician, <span class="persName-WBUCHAN">William Buchan</span> (<span class="date-1729-1805">1729–1805</span>).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">In the chapter of <a href="/notes/bibliography#BUCHANDOMESTICMEDICINE1791" target="_self"><span class="title-book-BUCHANDOMESTICMEDICINE1791"><i>Domestic Medicine</i></span></a>, 
                        “Cautions concerning Cold Bathing, and Drinking the Mineral Waters”,  <span class="persName-WBUCHAN">Buchan</span> concedes that 
                        “it is now fashionable for persons of all ranks to plunge into the sea, and drink the mineral waters”. He therefore 
                        undertakes to provide “hints or cautions” since “imprudent use” of these treatments have caused 
                        “many lives . . . [to be] lost, and numbers [to have] ruin[ed] their health”. Among those who “ought to be cautious in using the cold bath” and yet 
                        “who stand peculiarly in need of the bracing qualities of cold water” are “nervous” people, including 
                        “a great number of the male, and almost all the female inhabitants of great cities”. Lest these urban denizens 
                        cause themselves harm in striving to allay their nervous disease, <span class="persName-WBUCHAN">Buchan</span> advises that, 
                        “[f]or them, . . . the best plan would be to accustom themselves to it [cold bathing] 
                        by the most pleasing and gentle degrees”. The recommended method, which <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> repeats to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, is 
                        to take “one immersion at a time” and get “rubbed dry the moment” of coming “out of the water” and then 
                        “continue to take exercise for some time after”. After this trial, immersions may be repeated 
                        only if the bather is not afflicted by “chilness, loss of appetite, listlessness, pain of the breast or bowels, 
                        a prostration of strength, or violent head‐achs”

                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-WBUCHAN">Buchan</span> had fewer reservations about exposing youths to sea water: “To young people, and particularly to children, 
                        cold bathing is of the last importance. Their lax fibres render its tonic powers peculiarly proper. It promotes their growth, 
                        increases their strength, and prevents a variety of diseases incident to childhood”

                        Starting with the eighteenth edition (<span class="date-1803">1803</span>), the last edition revised by the author, the chapter “Cautions concerning Cold Bathing, and Drinking the Mineral Waters” 
                        was replaced by a more extensive analysis of cold‐bathing and mineral waters (see 
                        <span class="title-book-BUCHANDOMESTICMEDICINE1805"><i>Domestic Medicine</i></span> [1805], xii, 576–77). 
                        In her advice to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> appears to have consulted an earlier edition. 
                        The commentary on sea bathing contained in the only book attributed to <span class="persName-WBUCHAN">Buchan</span> that the Ruskins have been directly documented as owning, 
                        <span class="title-book-"><i>The Cottage Physician</i></span>, does not correspond to <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs advice to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>. 
                        This book, however, which was first published in <span class="date-1825">1825</span>, is not by <span class="persName-WBUCHAN">Buchan</span> at all. The title page alleges the editorship of “<span class="persName-WBUCHAN">W. Buchan</span>, M.D., and the members of a private medical society”, 
                        but the manual consists of a farrago of medical advice excerpted from various publications. The commentary on sea bathing is attributed to a “Dr. Robertson” (pp. 209–14).

                  <span class="head-section">The Ruskins at Seaside Resorts</span>
                  
                  <div class="p">By the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>, many seaside resorts had sprung up along the southern and southeastern coast of <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>, as well as elsewhere in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>. 
                        Besides the salubrity of sea bathing, which they could all claim, the resorts offered a wide range of amenities. 
                        One characteristic that evidently factored into the Ruskinsʼ choice among resorts 
                        was their respectability along with (or in spite of) their novelty. In <span class="date-1819">1819</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> made his trial of sea‐bathing 
                        at <span class="placeName-WEYMOUTH">Weymouth</span>, doubtless in part because he happened to have business in <span class="placeName-SOUTHAMPTON">Southampton</span> at the time 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd, ed.</span>, <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 95). 
                        <span class="placeName-WEYMOUTH">Weymouth</span> was also eminently respectable, even prestigious, having been patronized by the court of <span class="persName-KG3">George III</span>.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">In the last decade of the eighteenth century, the king was prescribed sea bathing to guard against a relapse of his madness. 
                        <span class="placeName-WEYMOUTH">Weymouth</span> was chosen, since it was already the site of a lodge belonging to his brother, <span class="persName-WHDG">Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester</span> (<span class="date-1743-1805">1743–1805</span>). 
                        The town was thus assured a place among the most fashionable seaside resorts, along witih <span class="placeName-BRIGHTON">Brighton</span>, which was favored by the Prince Regent. 
                        According to an <span class="date-1815">1815</span> guidebook to spas and resorts, whereas <span class="placeName-WEYMOUTH">Weymouth</span> was once “small and meanly built”, it had become “within the last twenty or thirty years”—that is, 
                        since the advent of royal residence—a city of “rapid enlargements, and many elegant buildings, . .  a very respectable place”. 
                        The guidebook notes that royal patronage persisted with the residence of <span class="persName-CAUGUSTA">Charlotte</span>, the popular Princess of Wales (<span class="date-1796-1817">1796–1817</span>), 
                        who spent a summer at Gloucester Lodge and had promised to return. (Instead, by the time of <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs visit to Weymouth, 
                        <span class="persName-CAUGUSTA">Charlotte</span> was mourned by the nation.) According to historical statistical measures of elite status among seaside resorts, 
                        <span class="placeName-WEYMOUTH">Weymouth</span> did continue to rank high and grow fast in the first third of the century 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JFELTHAM" target="_self"><span class="persName-JFELTHAM">Feltham</span>, <span class="title-book-JFELTHAM"><i>Guide to All the Watering and Sea‐Bathing Places</i></span></a>, 490–91; <a href="/notes/bibliography#WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT" target="_self"><span class="persName-JKW">Walton</span>, <span class="title-book-WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT"><i>The English Seaside Resort</i></span></a>, 12, 77–78).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="placeName-WEYMOUTH">Weymouth</span>ʼs royal associations would have appealed to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, 
                        just as his mother, <span class="persName-CTWR">Catherine Tweddale Ruskin</span> (<span class="date-1763-1817">1763–1817</span>), was reconciled 
                        to living for a time in the comparatively “shabby” seacoast town of <span class="placeName-DYSART">Dysart</span> by the prospect of “a number of Gentlemans seats close beside it, 
                        and a variety of beautifull walks—besides the <i>sea</i> which to me is a most delightful Object” 
                        (<span class="title-letter-"><span class="persName-CTWR">Catherine Ruskin</span> to <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, <span class="date-1808-10-25">25 October 1808</span></span>, in 
                        <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 26). 
                        <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> would have been reassured by <span class="placeName-WEYMOUTH">Weymouth</span>ʼs marketing of respectability, as suggested 
                        by the guidebookʼs invoking of <span class="persName-CAUGUSTA">Princess Charlotte</span>—a code meant, perhaps, to disassociate <span class="placeName-WEYMOUTH">Weymouth</span> 
                        from the moral stigma that clung to <span class="placeName-BRIGHTON">Brighton</span> owing to its connection with <span class="persName-CAUGUSTA">Charlotte</span>ʼs prodigal father, <span class="persName-KG4">George IV</span>. 
                        Nonetheless, <span class="placeName-WEYMOUTH">Weymouth</span>ʼs fashionableness may have seemed a cut above the Ruskinsʼ status; and in any case, 
                        the southern coastal resorts may have required too lengthy a journey for a short summer holiday. 
                        It is telling that, for their first visit to a resort as a family, the Ruskins chose <span class="placeName-SANDGATE">Sandgate</span>, 
                        a comparatively small, modest, and even unnoticed place. As late as the decades around the turn of the twentieth century,
                        <span class="placeName-SANDGATE">Sandgate</span> ranked only one hundreth in population among the nationʼs resorts (<a href="/notes/bibliography#WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT" target="_self"><span class="persName-JKW">Walton</span>, <span class="title-book-WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT"><i>The English Seaside Resort</i></span></a>, 65).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">The holiday in <span class="placeName-SANDGATE">Sandgate</span> must have occurred in summer <span class="date-1821">1821</span>, since <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> reflected on the excursion in <span class="date-1822-01">January 1822</span>. 
                        She looked back on it fondly, framing the visit in terms of homeliness: “I hope . . . we shall be permitted to enjoy our home and english comforts 
                        [in the coming months] and if we are to travel it may only be on such journey as our Sandgate one”. 
                        Even <span class="persName-JR">John</span> at age three considered <span class="placeName-SANDGATE">Sandgate</span> as the standard for what was “fine and . . . beautiful”, comparing its pleasures

                        At about the time of their visit, <span class="placeName-SANDGATE">Sandgate</span>, according to the <a href="/notes/bibliography#JFELTHAM" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JFELTHAM"><i>Guide to All the Watering and Sea‐Bathing Places</i></span></a>, 
                        was “a very pretty village”, which had “suddenly and deservedly started into notice as a watering place”. 
                        It could boast “neither a ball nor assembly room” like nearby <span class="placeName-DOVER">Dover</span>, <span class="placeName-FOLKESTONE">Folkestone</span>, or <span class="placeName-HYTHE">Hythe</span>, but for the Ruskins 
                        the point probably was that “the lovers of dancing” would gravitate to those resorts, leaving the family to quiet walks on the cliffs, 
                        commanding a prospect of the French coast; to exploring an Elizabethan castle, its fortress “lately . . . converted into a martello tower”, 
                        a reminder of the contest with Napoleonic <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span>; and to taking advantage of a “good circulating library” and “lodgings . . . on reasonable terms” (p. 423).</div>

                            and fashionable swindlers find employment and rapine elsewhere. Innocent recreational delight, card assemblies, 
                            billiards, riding, walking, reading, fishing, and other modes of pastime banish care from the mind, 
                            whilst the salubrity of the atmosphere impels disease from the body. The society of <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> are gay without profligacy, 
                            and enjoy life without mingling in its debaucheries”

                     <div class="p">Quoting this pronouncement a decade later in <span class="date-1815">1815</span>, the <a href="/notes/bibliography#JFELTHAM" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JFELTHAM"><i>Guide to All the Watering and Sea‐Bathing Places</i></span></a> deemed the statement fitting, 
                            but presents <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> as equivocally poised between decline from its prosperous past as a trading, fishing, and shipbuilding center and its ambition for its rebirth as a tourist resort. 
                            While acknowledging the townʼs strong suit in its impressive history and romantic landscape, this guidebook description harps on losses: 
                            “The present is a new town; the old one having been swallowed up by an inundation”, and the coast continues to erode; 
                            <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> “had formerly a good harbour”, which has lain in ruin since Elizabethan times; “trade . . . is inconsiderable, 
                            compared to what it once enjoyed”, though the boat builders continue to maintain a “high reputation”; and with “only one inn, properly so called”, 
                            “accommodations and attendance are frequently subjects of complaint”. Yet <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> “every year . . . seems to obtain fresh accessions of visitors”, 
                            and development is underway: “the promenade lately obtained . . . is a great improvement” 
                            (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JFELTHAM" target="_self"><span class="persName-JFELTHAM">Feltham</span>, <span class="title-book-JFELTHAM"><i>Guide to All the Watering and Sea‐Bathing Places</i></span></a>, 317, 318, 319, 320–21, 316). Whatever merit may have been warranted by these judgments, 
                            the assessment at least attests to an ancient coastal town striving to transform its economy 
                            from traditional but declining maritime occupations to modern tourism servicing the rising middle class.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">This entrepreneurial activity may have been what intrigued the Ruskins—particularly <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>—when they visited <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span>, probably for the first time in <span class="date-1826">1826</span>. 
                            The <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> was a peak decade for <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> as a resort (<a href="/notes/bibliography#WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT" target="_self"><span class="persName-JKW">Walton</span>, <span class="title-book-WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT"><i>The English Seaside Resort</i></span></a>, 58). 
                            Taking advantage of the rising tide of fashion for seeking health and pleasure at the seaside, 
                            the town was turning to account its decayed advantages as a port and fishery, able to offer the kind a beachfront well adapted for bathing—a 
                            wide coastal frontage with a gentle declivity for easy access to the sea. The town could also parlay resources 
                            appealing to a broader range of tourist engagement. The area was rich with historical asssociations, 
                            and its landscape was both picturesque and interesting to naturalists. 
                            Such variety and flexibility of touristic appeal, <span class="persName-JKW">Walton</span> argues, gave seaside resorts an edge over the older inland spas, 
                            which had little besides their mineral springs to recommend them. Also, unlike the traditional spas 
                            with their rigid social codes, the seaside resorts welcomed children (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT" target="_self"><span class="title-book-WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT"><i>The English Seaside Resort</i></span></a>, 
                            106–7, 16–17, 42–43, 217).

                            “<span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span>, as a public watering‐place . . . may boast the charm of uniting social and elegant pleasure with rural tranquillity”

                     <div class="p">To package the emerging resort industry of <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> with its picturesque and historical resources, artistic and antiquarian enterprises 
                            featured the town in publications of the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>. The most ambitious work focused on <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> particularly was an <span class="date-1824">1824</span> illustrated history, 
                            <a href="/notes/bibliography#MOSSHASTINGS" target="_self"><span class="title-book-MOSSHASTINGS"><i>The History and Antiquities of the Town and Port of Hastings</i></span></a>, 
                            written and illustrated by <span class="persName-WGMOSS">W. G. Moss</span> (dates unknown). As “draughtsman to His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge”, 
                            <span class="persName-WGMOSS">Moss</span> created the topographical, architectural, and antiquarian drawings, on which the engravings were based. 
                            The work was published by subscription, listing numerous royal subscribers, headed by <span class="persName-KG4">George IV</span>. 
                            The attention thus garnered for <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> may have helped the town to build a case for an elite clientele. 
                            Thus, notwithstanding the declaration by the <a href="/notes/bibliography#HASTINGSGUIDE1804" target="_self"><span class="title-book-HASTINGSGUIDE1804"><i>Hastings Guide</i></span></a> 
                            that the town set itself apart from resorts that harbored morally disreputable pleasures, 
                            <span class="persName-WGMOSS">Moss</span>ʼs stately work indicates how a bid for patronage by the late‐Georgian aristocracy could be accommodated along with appeal to the evanglical middle class. 
                            As <span class="persName-JKW">Walton</span> remarks, the visiting public at the resorts was formed from a “complex pattern of demand”, 
                            woven from “differing visiting publics, aristocratic and commercial . . . centered on the metropolis”, and reflecting a 
                            “wide range of social attributes, attitudes and expectations, which could be subsumed under each [social] label”, including 
                            “many shades of religious commitment” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT" target="_self"><span class="title-book-WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT"><i>The English Seaside Resort</i></span></a>, 14). A spectrum of desirably polite but moral society could be cultivated 
                            with the aid of an intelligent and appealing print and visual culture.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p"><span class="persName-WGMOSS">Moss</span>ʼs work perhaps more accurately reflects the appeal of a watering place like <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> to as a middle‐class family in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>, 
                            as compared with a grander illustrated publication such as the <a href="/notes/bibliography#COOKESOUTHERNCOAST" target="_self"><span class="title-book-COOKESOUTHERNVIEWS"><i>Picturesque Views on the Southern Coast of England</i></span></a>, which reached its conclusion in <span class="date-1826">1826</span>. 
                            The latter was a scheme by the engravers <span class="persName-WBCOOKE">William Bernard Cooke</span> (<span class="date-1778-1855">1778–1855</span>) and his brother <span class="persName-GCOOKE">George Cooke</span> (<span class="date-1781-1834">1781–1834</span>) to employ several artists, 
                            chiefly <span class="persName-JMWT">J. M. W. Turner</span>, in producing watercolor drawings of coastal scenes to be engraved and published in parts. In <span class="date-1811">1811</span>, when the Cookes first floated 
                            the idea with <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>, the scheme was novel, since most English topographical works were devoted to the countryʼs interior. The ambitious project was delayed by quarrels and professional setbacks, however, 
                            and when it reached its final collected form in <span class="date-1826">1826</span>, many expectations had been thwarted, including a spin‐off project to be entitled 
                            “Views at Hastings and Its Vicinity” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#SHANESTURNERSRIVERS" target="_self"><span class="persName-ESHANES">Shanes</span>, <span class="title-book-SHANESTURNERSRIVERS"><i>Turnerʼs Rivers, Harbours, and Coasts</i></span></a>, 6, 9 and 5–12 passim). The letterpress, also a disappointment, was originally prepared 
                            by <span class="persName-WC">William Combe</span> (<span class="date-1742-1823">1742–1823</span>), best known for <span class="title-poem-COLLINSDRSYNTAX">The Tour of Doctor Syntax, in Search of the Picturesque</span> (<span class="date-1812">1812</span>), 
                            illustrated by <span class="persName-">Thomas Rowlandson</span> for the publisher <span class="persName-RAP">Rudolph Ackermann</span>. For the collected <span class="date-1826">1826</span> volumes, <span class="persName-TR">Combe</span>ʼs text was revised by <span class="persName-BHOFLAND">Barbara Hofland</span> (<span class="date-1770-1844">1770–1844</span>), 
                            the childrenʼs writer, whose spouse was a landscape artist. Updating the letterpress, <span class="persName-BHOFLAND">Hofland</span> highlighted several of the seacoast locations as having achieved 
                            popularity for bathing and seaside recreation—<span class="placeName-MARGATE">Margate</span>, <span class="placeName-RAMSGATE">Ramsgate</span>, <span class="placeName-">Hastings</span>, <span class="placeName-BRIGHTON">Brighton</span>, <span class="placeName-WEYMOUTH">Weymouth</span>, <span class="placeName-LYME">Lyme</span>, <span class="placeName-TEIGNMOUTH">Teignmouth</span>, <span class="placeName-COMBEMARTIN">Comb‐Martin</span>, <span class="placeName-LYNEMOUTH">Lynemouth</span>, and <span class="placeName-MINEHEAD">Minehead</span>—but 
                            the emphasis was at variance with the engravings, few of which foregrounded such activities. <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>ʼs scenes in particular, on which the success of the publication depended, 
                            exclude signs of modern tourism. There are two exceptions: in the drawing for <span class="placeName-BRIGHTON">Brighton</span>, <span class="title-artwork-JMWTBRIGHTHELMSTON"><i>Brighthelmston</i> (engraved <span class="persName-GCOOKE">G. Cooke</span>)</span>, 
                            <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> admits the “New Chain Pier, or Suspension Bridge”, crammed with a fashionable crowd, into the scene, although viewed from a non‐participantʼs perspective 
                            in the open sea; and in <span class="title-artwork-JMWTPLYMOUTHDOCK"><i>Plymouth Dock</i> (engraved <span class="persName-WBCOOKE">W. B. Cooke</span>)</span>, 
                            he places promenaders in the foreground who are so frisky with “spirit and character” that the narrator is moved to comment on “Mr. Turnerʼs power, 
                            when he chuses to exert it, in delineating animate as well as inanimate nature”. Otherwise, the foregrounds of <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>ʼs coastal scenes are occupied 
                            solely by fishermen, washerwomen, smugglers, solidiers, and the like (<a href="/notes/bibliography#COOKESOUTHERNCOAST" target="_self"><span class="persName-WBCOOKE">W. B.

                            for <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span>ʼ transformation into a seaside resort, for which he uses the phrase “improving the town”—a key term in the period, <i>improvement</i>, 
                            used to characterize large‐scale city planning and imposition of a uniform style, such as <span class="persName-JN">John Nash</span>ʼs designs for <span class="placeName-building-REGENTSPARK">Regentʼs Park</span> in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, 
                            which could pervasively alter the character of a city (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MOSSHASTINGS" target="_self"><span class="title-book-MOSSHASTINGS"><i>The History and Antiquities of the Town and Port of Hastings</i></span></a>, 146; and see <a href="/notes/bibliography#SUMMERSONGEORGIANLONDON" target="_self"><span class="persName-JSUMMERSON">Summerson</span>, <span class="title-book-SUMMERSONGEORGIANLONDON"><i>Georgian London</i></span></a>, 198; and

                            In his preface, <span class="persName-WGMOSS">Moss</span> describes himself as an invalid who came to <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> for convalescence, and discovered 
                            a historical and picturesque treasure “heretofore . . . unnoticed and untouched” save by guidebooks. 
                            Claiming to scorn guidebooks, but making an exception for the <a href="/notes/bibliography#POWELLHASTINGSGUIDE" target="_self"><span class="title-book-POWELLHASTINGSGUIDE"><i>Hastings Guide</i></span></a> “published a few years since”, 
                            probably referring to an edition illustrated by his own designs (here engraved as outline drawings, which would later be elaborated for the <a href="/notes/bibliography#MOSSHASTINGS" target="_self"><span class="title-book-MOSSHASTINGS"><i>The History and Antiquities of the Town and Port of Hastings</i></span></a>), 
                            <span class="persName-WGMOSS">Moss</span> in fact compiles a version of a guidebook, with three lengthy chapters of military and ecclesiastical history followed by a fourth chapter 
                            that opens in the manner of a picturesque tour and goes on to highlight the improvements that have brought an “influx” 
                            of “visitants and strangers” who have “contributed to . . .
