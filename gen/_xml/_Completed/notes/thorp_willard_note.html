                    because in <span class="date-1939">1939</span> he was instrumental in establishing a research collection of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscripts, including juvenilia, 
                    at Princeton University Library. Thus, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collecting at Princeton mirrored that at Yale University Library, 
                    as well as at the Pierpont Morgan Library and the Huntington Library; 
                    and <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span> helped coalesce the biographically comprehensive approach to the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> archive that

               <div class="p">In collecting of Victorian printed works, Princeton and Yale reflected a trend associated with 
                    <a href="/notes/collecting_of_modern_authors_note" target="_self">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</a>. 
                    Private collectors sought to compile a comprehensive run of an authorʼs first editions in their original condition, 
                    from juvenilia to last words—a goal that for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> and <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett‐Browning</span>, <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span>, and other major British nineteenth‐century writers could entail hundreds of items. 
                    American institutions benefited by donations of such collections, Yale receiving a nearly complete <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> bequest from 
                    <a href="/notes/adam_r_b_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-RBA">R. B. Adam II</span> (<span class="date-1863-1940">1863–1940</span>)</a> in <span class="date-1929">1929</span>. 
                    Princeton lacked a benefactor for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, but <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span> helped put Princeton Library 
                    on the path to assembling an impressive literary archive of nineteenth‐century British writers (and later, nineteenth‐ and twentieth‐century American writers) by persuading many collectors 
                    to contribute to the libraryʼs rare‐book holdings.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">First‐edition hunters extended their print collections with manuscripts, <i>alia</i>, and—in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs case, drawings—as such items came available;

                    Fortunately for American institutions, the <span class="placeName-BOSTON">Boston</span> rare‐book and literary manuscript dealer,

                    who was himself a <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collector, took advantage of the auctions with boldness and intelligence. 
                    Through <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, Yale was the beneficiary primarily of the <span class="date-1930">1930</span> sale, their acquisitions directed by

                    While Yale and Princeton owe much to the respective individual energies of <span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span> and <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span>, as institutions the universities also shared a context that encouraged

                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span> ultimately built his scholarly reputation as an Americanist, but when these developments in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collecting were unfolding in the <span class="date-1920-1939">1920s and 1930s</span> 
                     <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span> was teaching British Victorian and modern poetry. With degrees in English from Hamilton College (B.A.) and Harvard University (M.A.), 
                        <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span> first taught at Smith College in <span class="date-1921-1924">1921–24</span>, and then came to Princeton in <span class="date-1925">1925</span> for a Ph.D. in English. 
                        He completed the degree in <span class="date-1926">1926</span> and joined the teaching staff of Princetonʼs English Department. Although his dissertation concerned realism in Elizabethan drama, 
                        he earned popularity as a teacher with a course on Victorian poetry. An early publication in this area—following 
                        his first major article, in <span class="title-periodical-PMLA"><i>PMLA</i></span> for <span class="date-1928">1928</span>, on stage adaptations of English Gothic fiction, which secured his assistant professorship—was a <span class="date-1932">1932</span> anthology of Victorian poets, 
                        <span class="title-book-THORPPARROTTPOETRYOFTHETRANSITION"><i>Poetry of the Transition, <span class="date-1850-1914">1850–1914</span></i></span>,

                        By <span class="date-1939">1939</span>, when he achieved the rank of associate professor, <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span> had begun turning his research and teaching to American literature, 
                        undertaking in <span class="date-1940">1940</span> to teach Princetonʼs first graduate seminar in American studies (on the Transcendentalists), and in <span class="date-1941">1941</span> he organized 
                        the interdisciplinary American Civilization Program, the first interdepartmental program at Princeton

                        The year <span class="date-1939">1939</span>, when <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span> organized donors for the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> purchase, might therefore be regarded as the culmination of his Victorian scholarship, before he turned to other interests.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">The anthology <span class="title-book-THORPPARROTTPOETRYOFTHETRANSITION"><i>Poetry of the Transition</i></span> 
                        reflects a breadth of acquaintance with both major and lesser‐known poets of the period. 
                        While <span class="persName-DARJR">David A. Robertson</span> recalls <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span>ʼs classes in terms anticipating the practical criticism of I. A. Richards—<span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span> 
                        would hand out mimeographed poems missing the poetʼs name and require students to write responses in direct engagement with the work, not the poet or period 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#ROBERTSONTHORP" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-ROBERTSONTHORP">“Remembering Professor Thorp”</span></a>, 129)—<span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span> did expect his students to survey writers and periods expansively. 
                        According to the introduction of <span class="title-book-THORPPARROTTPOETRYOFTHETRANSITION"><i>Poetry of the Transition</i></span>, 
                        the editors excluded writers “from whose work it was . . . impossible to gather a sufficient number 
                        of poems to furnish material for at least one conference or recitation” since “long experience in teaching has shown that little is to be gained 
                        by a class discussion of isolated specimens”. And though the introduction declares from the outset that “there is no such thing as <i>poetry</i>”, 
                        “there are only poems”, the anthology represents each of its poets in a well‐rounded arc of development in order to tell its story 
                        “of the years of transition from Victorian reticence and respectability to the chaos of the War”. The editors believe in a <i>zeitgeist</i>: 
                        the “predominant trait” of the period, they say, was “individualism” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#THORPPARROTTPOETRYOFTHETRANSITION" target="_self"><span class="title-book-THORPPARROTTPOETRYOFTHETRANSITION"><i>Poetry of the Transition</i></span></a>, ix–x, xxi–xxii). 
                        These convictions as a teacher guided <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span> as a collector in his drive to establish Princeton University Libraryʼs collection of Victorian poets with 
                        no concessions to abridgement that would curtail studentsʼ research. The ambition was in sync with the phenomenon of biographically oriented first‐edition collecting, 
                        which had begun in the period covered in <span class="persName-TMP">Parrott</span> and <span class="persName-">Thorp</span>ʼs anthology.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Over the years, <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span> became a noted collector and donor to Princeton University Library himself, 
                        and he lent his influence to attracting major collections to the library that did not necessarily pertain to his personal scholarship and teaching, 
                        such as the <span class="persName-MLP">Morris L. Parrish</span> collection of Victorian novels,

                        was appointed keeper of rare books at the <span class="placeName-building-STERLINGMEM">Sterling Library</span> on the strength of his advocacy, like <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span>ʼs, not only of building special collections but also of involving students in the use of archives. 
                        (At the time, <span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span> also happened to be working on poetry, publishing <span class="title-book-TINKERGOODESTATE"><i>The Good Estate of Poetry</i></span> in <span class="date-1929">1929</span>.) 
                        <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span>, who in <span class="date-1930">1930</span> was a young assistant professor, was asked by his dean to work with the newly formed 
                        Friends of the Princeton University Library. To demonstrate its ambitions in practical terms, 
                        the organization published in each of the first several issues of its newsletter, <span class="title-periodical-BIBLIAFPUL"><i>Biblia</i></span>, 
                        a list of <span class="title-essay-DESIDERATAFPUL1">“Desiderata”</span> for the library needed by the departments. The first issueʼs wish‐list reflected the passions of the popular new professor of Victorian poetry 
                        (and probably also his mentor, <span class="persName-TMP">Parrott</span>), 
                        consisting of “first editions” of <span class="persName-RB">Robert Browning</span>. The list reflected the prevailing standard for collecting a run of “firsts” from early works to late, 
                        ranging from the youthful <span class="title-poem-BROWNINGPAULINE"><i>Pauline</i></span> of <span class="date-1833">1833</span> to a late publication of <span class="date-1884">1884</span>

                        For the second issue of the newsletter, <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span> followed up with a <span class="title-essay-DESIDERATAFPUL2">“Desiderata”</span> calling for 1,200 titles by 400 Victorian poets. 
                        The estimated cost of the whole, minus the <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> firsts, was calculated at $3,500

                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span>ʼs two “Desiderata” represented the enigma confronting the library and its supporters. Before showy items for the Special Collections could be contemplated, 
                        the library needed to assemble a basic research‐grade collection 
                        (see <a href="/notes/provenance_american_research_libraries_note#PRINCETON" target="_self">Ruskin Collecting by American Research Libraries in the Twentieth Century: Ruskin and the Building of Special Collections at Princeton University</a>). 
                        In the third issue of <span class="title-periodical-BIBLIAFPUL"><i>Biblia</i></span>, the chair of English, 
                        <span class="persName-DQB">Dickson Q. Brown</span>, 
                        justified his facultyʼs call for “first editions of books of the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries”, 
                        especially “copies of obscurer writings . . . which can be had only in contemporary editions” from their respective periods, 
                        and “which are of the utmost significance because of the light . . . they throw on the tastes and interests of a bygone generation 
                        from which some great masterpiece has emerged”. As it stood, even undergraduate English majors, when researching senior theses with a “zest” 
                        to discover “something which no one has known before”, had to board a train for the Yale and Columbia university libraries 
                        to find basic materials for their projects (<a href="/notes/bibliography#BROWNLIBRARYNEEDSFPUL" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-BROWNLIBRARYNEEDSFPUL">“Committee on Library Needs”</span> [<span class="date-1931-03">March 1931</span>]</a>, 2, 4). 
                        To make the needs plain, this issue of <span class="title-periodical-BIBLIAFPUL"><i>Biblia</i></span> concluded with a sixteen‐page supplement identifying a “want‐list” 
                        of hundreds of literary titles presently unavailable in the home university library. Given these basic disciplinary needs, which were multiplied over many departments, 
                        <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span> later remembered that, “even by <span class="date-1930">1930</span>, there was seldom anything left over” in the library budget 
                        “for a rare book or an important unpublished manuscript” to grace Special Collections

                  <div class="p">In <span class="date-1939">1939</span>, therefore, in order to purchase the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscripts from <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>,

                        the Department of Art and Archaeology, which was closely allied with the recently formed School of Architecture—perhaps 
                        the campaign for the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> acquisition was boosted by the writerʼs interdisciplinary appeal. Ultimately, a portion of the purchase comprising six of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs sketchbooks and notebooks 
                        was housed in McCormick Hall, the campus art museum and home of Art, Archaeology, and Architecture, rather than in the Library Special Collections

Nonetheless, English faculty predominated among the donors to the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> purchase, 
                        and the campaign was headed by <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span> along with another professor in the English Department. 
                        Although interdisciplinary and interdepartmental by nature of its materials, the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> purchase can be viewed as culminating the decade of collecting in Victorian literature 
                        that began with <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span>ʼs bold call for a comprehensive collection of first editions by four hundred poets

                  <div class="p">Throughout the <span class="date-1930-1939">1930s</span>, <span class="title-periodical-BIBLIAFPUL"><i>Biblia</i></span> records a steady flow of significant acquisitions by Princeton University Library in Victorian poetry. 
                        In <span class="date-1933">1933</span>, the library gained a comprehensive collection of <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span> “firsts”, along with an <span class="persName-RLS">R. L. Stevenson</span> collection 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#GEROULDVANDYKE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JTG">Gerould</span>, <span class="title-essay-GEROULDVANDYKE">“The Henry Van Dyke Bequest”</span></a>). From <span class="date-1933-1938">1933 through 1938</span>, a loyal donor, 
                        <span class="persName-FHP">Francis H. Payne</span>, was thanked for supplying funds to purchase Victorian poetry as well as for donating items from his own collection, 
                        including first or early editions by the Pre‐Raphaelites, <span class="persName-CKDP">Coventry Patmore</span>, <span class="persName-FT">Francis Thompson</span>, and others. 
                        In <span class="date-1937">1937</span>, <span class="persName-FHP">Payne</span> was tapped again for funds, this time to acquire English novels, <span class="date-1750-1830">1750–1830</span>, in support of “the establishment in the curriculum 
                        of a graduate course in prose fiction” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#VICTORIANPOETSBIBLIA" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-VICTORIANPOETSBIBLIA">“Victorian Poets”</span></a>; 
                        <a href="/notes/bibliography#COVENTRYPATMOREBIBLIA" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-COVENTRYPATMOREBIBLIA">“Coventry Patmore”</span></a>; <a href="/notes/bibliography#VICTORIANPOETRYBIBLIA" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-VICTORIANPOETRYBIBLIA">“Victorian Poetry”</span></a>; <a href="/notes/bibliography#THORPTWOSPECIALCOLLECTIONS" target="_self"><span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span>, <span class="title-essay-THORPTWOSPECIALCOLLECTIONS">“Two Special Collections”</span></a>, 6). Also in <span class="date-1937">1937</span>, 
                        an Arthurian‐themed collection brought first editions to the library that were concentrated mainly in Victorian poetry 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#ARTHURIANLEGENDBIBLIA" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-ARTHURIANLEGENDBIBLIA">“The Arthurian Legend”</span></a>). Over time, even <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span>ʼs initial call for <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> “firsts” was eventually realized, 
                        with the library acquiring eight of the eleven items in the original wish‐list 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#THORPFIRST25YEARS" target="_self"><span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span>, <span class="title-essay-THORPFIRST25YEARS">“The First Twenty‐five Years”</span></a>, 103). Meanwhile, <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span> was also on the lookout for Victorian fiction: 
                        a <span class="date-1933">1933</span> account in <span class="title-periodical-BIBLIAFPUL"><i>Biblia</i></span>—unsigned, but written in <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span>ʼs florid and convivial style—about the opening of an exhibition 
                        of <span class="persName-MLP">Morris Parrish</span>ʼs <span class="persName-FMT">Trollope</span> collection reads like an overture to the bequest of his entire Victorian fiction collection, 
                        which would finally be delivered in <span class="date-1944">1944</span>.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Judging by the pages of <span class="title-periodical-BIBLIAFPUL"><i>Biblia</i></span>, <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span>ʼs success in attracting donors may have aroused jealousy, even in his own department. 
                        In <span class="date-1936">1936</span>, on the occasion of the Princeton Library having acquired in <span class="date-1935">1935</span> some significant items in <span class="persName-JMILTON">Milton</span> studies, 
                        the Miltonist <span class="persName-MWK">Maurice W. Kelley</span> loftily declared that the library “has yet to be given a single collection of any great English writer”—the 
                        acquisitions in Victorian studies over the previous five years apparently not qualifying for that distinction. 
                        <span class="persName-MWK">Kelley</span> pointedly remarked that “the works of <span class="persName-JMILTON">John Milton</span> . . . , which are of deep and vital interest to every heir 
                        of the great tradition of English speaking people, yet await the name of a donor”, and he suggested that acquisitions 
                        for “other collections already started” should cease (<a href="/notes/bibliography#KELLEYMILTONCOLLECTION" target="_self"><span class="persName-MWK">Kelley</span>, <span class="title-essay-KELLEYMILTONCOLLECTION">“John Milton Collection”</span></a>, 4). 
                        Undeterred, <span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span> noted in the next issue of <span class="title-periodical-BIBLIAFPUL"><i>Biblia</i></span> following <span class="persName-MWK">Kelley</span>ʼs broadside 
                        that some resources dedicated to American studies had dried up, and he insisted that “the library must continue buying American literature” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#THORPTWOCOLLECTIONS" target="_self"><span class="persName-WT">Thorp</span>, <span class="title-essay-THORPTWOCOLLECTIONS">“Two Special Collections”</span></a>, 7). 
                        Presumably, he believed that the great tradition of English‐speaking people would be advanced, rather than deflected by an innovative program in American studies.</div>
