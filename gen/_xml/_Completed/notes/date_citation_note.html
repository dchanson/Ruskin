               <div class="p">On the Apparatus Page for any given work, the “Date” section begins with a declaration of a date or a date range, 
                    which is used to place the work in the chronological index of the archive
                    (see <a href="/notes/plan_of_archive_note" target="_self">The Plan of the Archive</a>). This opening declaration in the “Date” section 
                    is followed by a discussion of the evidence for dating the work. The choice of date for indexing purposes awards priority to a date inscribed in the manuscript 
                    by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself or by his parents, if that date is reasonably trustworthy; otherwise, the opening declaration uses a date or date range of composition.</div>
               
               <div class="p">The date thus selected for indexing purposes is somewhat arbitrary since, as the discussion in the “Date” section of an apparatus clarifies in any given instance,
                    the date that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> or his parents inscribed may refer to a variety of stages in the composition, specifying possibly when he wrote a work, or when he fair‐copied it, 
                    or the occasion when he presented it to a recipient. For example, a date of “<span class="date-1828-01-01">1 January 1828</span>” that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> inscribed on a
                    <a href="/notes/new_years_poems_note" target="_self">New Yearʼs Poem</a> refers obviously to the occasion of the fair copyʼs presentation, 
                    and <span class="date-1828-01-01">1 January 1828</span> is used to index the poem in the archive. In such an instance, as the discussion of a work will clarify, however, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would typically have drafted and fair‐copied
                    the poem in <span class="date-1827-12-01-1827-12-31">December 1827</span>.</div>
               
               <div class="p">For indexing purposes, less credence is apt to be awarded to dates inscribed in the manuscript by later hands—typically by
                    <a href="/notes/wedderburn_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-AW">Alexander Wedderburn</span> (d. <span class="date-1931">1931</span>)</a> 
                    or <a href="/notes/collingwood_w_g_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> (<span class="date-1854-1932">1854–1932</span>)</a>. If these dates are questionable, 
                    the inscription is merely mentioned and discussed in the “Date” section.</div>
               
               <div class="p">In some cases, even dates that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself inscribed can be very misleading. For example, he dated several poems in <a href="/apparatuses/msiii_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a> 
                    as <span class="date-1829-03-09">9 March 1829</span>. He is unlikely to have composed, or even fair‐copied, so many poems in a single day. This may be a case in which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs inscription of a date 
                    refers, rather, to a wished‐for date of fair‐copying, a performative episode turning on tensions arising from his parentsʼ attempts to control his writing, 
                    in conflict with his ardent desire to please them with his compositions 
                    (see <a href="/apparatuses/of_rocks_first_apparatus#DISCUSSION.php" target="_self">“Of rocks first and of caverns now I sing”: Discussion</a>).</div>
               
               <div class="p">The compositional date is given—and the piece is ordered sequentially
                    within a given year, according to that date—only when a datable
                    rough draft or some other hard evidence about its composition is available. In
                    cases for which only the fair copy remains, one may often assume only a few
                    months, at most, to have elapsed between beginning composition and
                    fair‐copying. Parts of some longer poems such
                    as <a href="/apparatuses/eudosia_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-RUSKINEUDOSIA">“Eudosia”</span></a> appear, in fact, to have been
                    fair‐copied almost as soon as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drafted them. Such assumptions
                    are not uniformly safe, however, since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs anthologies include
                    poems that good evidence may date as much as a year earlier than when he
                    compiled the anthology.</div>
