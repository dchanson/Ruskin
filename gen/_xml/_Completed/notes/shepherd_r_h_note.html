                    In addition to the <a href="/notes/bibliography_of_ruskin_shepherd_note" target="_self">Ruskin bibliography</a>, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> 
                    compiled bibliographies of several other modern authors: <span class="persName-CJHD">Dickens</span> (<span class="date-1880">1880</span>),

                    Although little more than handlists, rather than descriptive or analytical bibliographies in a present‐day sense, 
                    <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherdʼs</span> publications aspired to exhaustiveness, 
                    and his thoroughness led him to uncover early writing by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and others that was then little known.</div>
               
               <div class="p">In addition to ferreting out modern authorsʼ early work for bibliographical description, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> edited a wide range of juvenilia and youthful writing for

                    Justifying the volume as preserving “materials for such a study,” materials that might otherwise be allowed to “perish,” <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> threads together commentary 
                    with liberal quotation from  <span class="persName-ALT">Tennysonʼs</span> published early poetry,

                    printed <span class="persName-ALT">Tennysonʼs</span>ʼs early <span class="title-poem-TENNYSONLOVERS"><i>The Loverʼs Tale</i></span>, which the poet had suppressed. 
                    In <span class="date-1872">1872</span> (new ed., <span class="date-1878">1878</span>), he

                    believed that <span class="title-book-BARRETTBROWNINGANESSAYONMIND"><i>An Essay on Mind</i></span> was <span class="persName-EBB">Barrettʼs</span> earliest published volume, whereas it was in fact preceded in
                    <span class="date-1820">1820</span> by <span class="title-poem-THEBATTLEOFMARATHON"><i>The Battle of Marathon</i></span>. <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> was correct, however, that the next volume to appear after <span class="title-book-BARRETTBROWNINGANESSAYONMIND"><i>An Essay on Mind</i></span> was
                    <span class="title-book-PROMETHEUSBOUNDANDMISC1833"><i>Prometheus Bound . . . and Miscellaneous Poems</i></span>.) 
                    Also in <span class="date-1878">1878</span>, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> collected <span class="title-book-HWLEARLYPOEMS"><i>The Early Poems of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</i></span>, and he included <span class="persName-TM">Mooreʼs</span> juvenilia, along with a

                    and other early sketches, which <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherdʼs</span> included in a republication of his bibliography of the novelist.</div>
               
               <div class="p">In <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>ʼs facsimile editions of modern authorsʼ works, the contents are dominated by juvenilia and youthful writing, 
                    doubtless owing in part to the appeal that the rarity of such items posed to collectors, and the opportunity that these scarce items afforded to a publishing market eager to serve collectors 
                    (see <a href="/notes/collecting_of_modern_authors_note" target="_self">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</a>). The

                    were often indignant to find their earlier work resusitated, and both <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span> and <span class="persName-RB">Robert Browning</span> contested
                    <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>ʼs publications as piracies. <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span>, who in <span class="date-1862">1862</span> 
                    had already sued a bookseller, <span class="persName-JCH">J. C. Hotten</span>, for sale of a piracy, <span class="title-book-TENNYSON1833POEMS"><i>Poems, <span class="date-1830-1833">1830–1833</span></i></span>,

                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#FIRSTPIRATEDEDITION" target="_self">Sinclair, “First Pirated Edition of Tennysonʼs Poems”</a>), 
                    was irritated by <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherdʼs</span> <span class="title-ana-TENNYSONIANA"><i>Tennysoniana</i></span> and in <span class="date-1866">1866</span> complained to 
                    the publisher, <span class="persName-BMP">Basil Montagu</span> that its publication was “against my desire,” having an “infinite dislike to the 
                    sort of book about anyone”; and he accused the bookʼs scholarship of inaccuracy (letter of <span class="date-1866-05-14">14 May 1866</span>, 
                    in <a href="/notes/bibliography#TENNYSONLETTERS" target="_self"><span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span>, <i>Letters</i></a>, 2: 436). 
                    Later, <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span> drew the line when he learned that <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> 
                    had printed a transcript of the Laureateʼs early poem, <span class="title-poem-TENNYSONLOVERS"><i>The Loverʼs Tale</i></span> (composed <span class="date-1827-1828">1827–28</span>), 
                    in <span class="date-1870">1870</span> and again in <span class="date-1875">1875</span>. In 
                    <span class="date-1875-1876">1875–76</span>, the poet adopted legal proceedings and won an injunction against 
                    <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherdʼs</span> pirating activities connected with the <i>Tale</i> 
                    and some other poems, although, on learning that <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> was poor, <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span> 
                    himself paid the court costs with which the defendant was charged 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#TENNYSONSHEPHERDWISE" target="_self"><span class="persName-WDP">Paden</span>, <span class="title-essay-PADENTENNYSONSHEPHERDWISE">“Tennysonʼs <span class="title-poem-TENNYSONLOVERS"><i>The Loverʼs Tale </i></span>, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>, and <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span>,”</span></a>, 119–24; 
                    as a legitimate publication, the text existed only as a scarce <span class="date-1833">1833</span> pamphlet, 
                    originally printed by the poet at his own expense and for private circulation only, 
                    <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span> having decided to remove the poem from the manuscript of his <span class="date-1832">1832</span> <span class="title-book-TENNYSON1832POEMS"><i>Poems</i></span> published by <span class="persName-EM">Edward Moxon</span> [ibid., pp. 112–13]).</div>
               
               <div class="p">While <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> admitted his guilt and full responsibility for the <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span> piracy, 
                    the episode points to a larger issue respecting the extent of writersʼ authority to control access to texts and their 
                    varying states versus collectorsʼ desires to possess and study 
                    scarce publications, authorized or otherwise. In <span class="persName-ALT">Tennysonʼs</span> case, his objections appear to have 
                    extended beyond a legitimate concern to protect an unpublished (if printed) poem 
                    to a belief that authorial control was absolute, that an authorʼs revision or 
                    suppression of a work obviated the publicʼs right to curiosity about 
                    previous states of that work. Even scholarly examination of his influences provoked the poetʼs scorn and anxiety, as when he famously demeaned 
                    <span class="persName-JCC">John Churton Collins</span> (<span class="date-1848-1908">1848–1908</span>) as a “Louse upon the Locks of Literature” for having published such scholarship 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#EDMUNDGOSSE" target="_self">Thwaite, <i>Edmund Gosse</i></a>, 295–97; 
                    <span class="persName-JCC">Collinsʼs</span> also compiled an edition of <span class="persName-ALT">Tennysonʼs</span> revised and suppressed early poems,

                    Despite this intimidating reaction, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> remained undaunted in supplying “materials for . . . study” of “‘the growth of a Poetʼs mind’”, 
                    a purpose that, he declared, 
                    trumps both popular opinion of the value of such materials and authors’ authority over their dissemination (when there is no legal obstacle in copyright): 
                    “A poet himself, or the relations of a poet, may not . . . always be the best or the final judges of what should continue to hold a place in the collection of his writings”. 
                    Even if the literary value of a given early work seems doubtful, “the study of [a poetʼs] mind and work should be left to the scholar to decide, not to the poet”

               <div class="p">With these latter, defiant remarks, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> renewed his cause in the face of opposition by <span class="persName-RB">Robert Browning</span>.

                    of <span class="title-poem-TENNYSONLOVERS"><i>The Loverʼs Tale</i></span> that was sold in <span class="date-1870">1870</span> to <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherdʼs</span>

                    <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> later acknowledged in court that he incited the journalʼs attack on <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>, 
                    although he testified that he did not himself author the journalʼs squib and disclaimed knowledge of the writerʼs identity

                    It must have been <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span>, however, who provided the journal with its key argument opposing the reprint—namely, that 
                    <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> violated the wishes of the late poet, <span class="persName-EBB">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</span>,

                    public may be to them” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#LITERARYGOSSIPDEC76" target="_self">“Mrs. Browningʼs <span class="title-book-BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878">Earlier Poems</span>”</a>, 722). 
                    While the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum</i></span> contested <span class="persName-RHC">Shepherdʼs</span> right to the shorter poems as well, 
                    and in the coming months repeatedly impugned his honesty, the journal was probably unjustified in attributing the editorʼs motives solely to greed. 
                    In other instances, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> was not timid about upholding the claims of scholarship against the mere assertion of power by literary men with intimidating reputations. 
                    For example, in the <span class="date-1867-1900">later nineteenth-century</span> revival of <span class="persName-WBP">William Blake,</span> <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> was unique among editors 
                    in his insistence on a “historical” (i.e., diplomatic) approach to the texts. In contrast, the Rossetti brothers, 
                    <span class="persName-WMR">William Michael</span> and <span class="persName-DGR">Dante Gabriel,</span> “practiced emendation” of <span class="persName-WBP">Blakeʼs</span> texts that amounted to wholesale rewriting. They made free with the texts in the belief 
                    that such an approach was justified by the view of <span class="persName-WBP">Blake</span> as vatic, heroic, and individualistic, 
                    a Carlylean representation of the poet advocated by the <span class="persName-WBP">Blake</span> biographer, <span class="persName-AGB">Alexander Gilchrist</span> (<span class="date-1828-1861">1828–61</span>). 
                    In lonely opposition to this powerful current of opinion forming <span class="persName-WBP">Blakeʼs</span> reputation, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> stood up for the integrity of the text over an assertion of control by any author, living or dead: 
                    “<span class="persName-DGR">Mr. [D. G.] Rossetti</span> (though sanctioned by Mr. <span class="persName-ACS">[Algernon] Swinburne</span>) has no more right,” <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> pronounced, 
                    “to alter <span class="persName-WBP">William Blakeʼs</span> poems than <span class="persName-JEM">Mr. [John Everett] Millais</span> would have to paint out some obnoxious detail of medievalism in a work of Giotto or Cimabue”—<span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> 
                    strategically turning the Pre-Raphaelitesʼ own historicist stance against them

                    appeared in late <span class="date-1877">1877</span> or early <span class="date-1878">1878</span>, the reprint did omit

                    justifies the omission in terms compliant with <span class="persName-RB">Robert Browningʼs</span> objections—namely, that 
                    the translation had been “replaced by the authoress in later years by an entirely new version”. To this admission, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> adds the value judgment that 
                    “to re‐produce the earlier crude attempt [at translation] or the girlish preface that 
                    accompanied it” would not be “wise or desirable”. <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> thus entangles himself in contradiction, 
                    by referring to criteria of “crudeness” and “girlishness”, which justify suppression of some juvenilia, 
                    while declaring that the other selections from <span class="title-book-PROMETHEUSBOUNDANDMISC1833"><i>Prometheus Bound . . . and Miscellaneous Poems</i></span>, which he does reprint, 
                    are “in no sense immature, or unworthy of the genius of the writer”. At the same time, 
                    the introduction contains a passage nearly identical to one that, in his December <span class="date-1876">1876</span> reply to the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum</i></span> a year earlier, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> 
                    had pleaded in defense of the study of poetsʼ youthful writing: 
                    “The ‘exquisite touch’ that ‘bides in the birth of things’ is peculiarly apparent in the bursting of bud and leaf of a new poetic genius. 
                    The summer of its manifestation may have greater fervour, and richer pomp and majesty of foliage, but about its early spring there must always be a nameless and peculiar charm” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878" target="_self"><span class="title-book-BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878"><i>The Earlier Poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, <span class="date-1826-1833">1826–1833</span></i></span></a>, vii–viii; 
                    and see <a href="/notes/bibliography#LITERARYGOSSIPDEC76" target="_self">“Mrs. Browningʼs Earlier Poems”</a>, 722). This florid metaphor, 
                    in which <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> manifestly retained his faith, is consistent with his declarations elsewhere of a mission to make available the juvenile materials 
                    for studying the “growth of a poetʼs mind.” According to the metaphor, these materials do not consist in Wordsworthian spots of time 
                    remembered from the youthʼs experience of nature; rather, the metaphor figures the precocious child genius <i>as</i> nature, 
                    and her or his early publications (or, presumably, manuscripts) as the material witness of this bursting into bud and leaf.</div>
               
               <div class="p">In <span class="date-1877-12">December 1877</span>, the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum</i></span> carried a review of the <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett Browning</span> reprint. 
                    The writer has been identified as <span class="persName-TWD">Theodore Watts‐Dunton</span> (<span class="date-1832-1914">1832–1914</span>; 
                    <a href="/notes/bibliography#WMROSSETTILETTERS" target="_self">W. M. Rossetti, <i>Selected Letters</i></a>, 374–75), 
                    a solicitor turned man of letters, who became poetry critic for the journal, and who would later appoint himself caretaker of <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne,</span> in order to rescue that poetʼs mind from his infantile body, wrecked by alcoholism and self‐abuse. 
                    In the review, <span class="persName-TWD">Watts‐Dunton</span> tasks <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> as a “booksellerʼs hack” who, “devoid” of “literary taste,” 
                    “must be called a bibliographer, . . . by dint of that enormous patience which often accompanies a dearth of intelligence”, 
                    and which makes him “really learned in editions and in variations of texts” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#REVIEWBARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878" target="_self">Unsigned review of <span class="title-books-BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878"><i>The Earlier Poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning</i></span></a>, 765–66). 
                    This contempt for the editor of reprinted early works and compiler of “variations of texts”,—a sneer detectable in the tone even of 
                    <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherdʼs</span> newspaper obituary, which pronounced him “a great authority upon the various editions, with their additions and emendations, of the works” 
                    of modern authors (<a href="/notes/bibliography#SHEPHERDOBITUARY" target="_self">Unsigned obituary of <span class="persName-RHS">Richard Herne Shepherd</span></a>)—must have sprung from a culturally significant animus, 
                    one that prompted <span class="persName-TWD">Watts‐Dunton</span> to feel warranted in using such intemperate language. 
                    As a solicitor, <span class="persName-TWD">Watts‐Dunton</span> would have been interested in questions of copyright raised by the reprint. 
                    (One wonders if he authored the journalʼs initial <span class="date-1876">1876</span> volley against the planned reprint, a paragraph informed by a legal opinion: “were it a question of tables or chairs, 
                    <span class="persName-RB">Mr. Browning</span> could defend the wishes of his wife; but in the case of poems, 
                    our wise laws give him no remedy” [<a href="/notes/bibliography#LITERARYGOSSIPNOV76" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-LITERARYGOSSIPNOV76">“Literary Gossip” [<span class="date-1876-11-25">25 November 1876</span>]</span></a>, 690]. 
                    <span class="persName-TWD">Watts‐Dunton</span> would have been in a position to advise the journal, having joined the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum</i></span> staff only months earlier, in <span class="date-1876-07">July 1876</span> 
                    [<a href="/notes/bibliography#WATTSDUNTONLIFE" target="_self"><span class="persName-THAKE">Hake</span> and <span class="persName-ACOMPTONRICKETT">Compton-Rickett</span>, <span class="title-book-WATTSDUNTONLIFE"><i>Life and Letters of Theodore Watts-Dunton</i></span></a>, 1: 237].) 
                    Questions of copyright aside, <span class="persName-TWD">Watts‐Dunton</span> uses a figure comparing <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> to an “insect”, which echoes a characterization by <span class="persName-WMR">William Michael Rossetti</span>, 
                    and which suggests that the animus of these men arose less from outrage over legal violation 
                    than from their indignation over what they perceived as <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherdʼs</span> loss of professional caste. <span class="persName-WMR">Rossetti</span> characterizes <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> as a “vampire,” 
                    the figure suggesting a parasitical feeding on the corpus of the author. The contempt appears to center in a perception of the reprint editor as violating the authorʼs integrity and possession of self. 
                    Whatʼs worse, the reprint editor poses a particularly degrading, subordinate form of parasitical exploitation, since the editor works for a publisher. 
                    <span class="persName-WMR">Rossetti</span> struggles to elaborate this figure for the editor of “early poems” and “forgotten works” in a way that pushes the editor sufficiently low in the food chain: 
                    “To be oneʼs own vampire is an unenviable lot; to be somebody elseʼs vampire is a post to which only a torturous ambition could aspire”. 
                    In another of <span class="persName-WMR">Rossettiʼs</span> stretched analogies, the reprint editor combines the role of the “chiffonier” (i.e., ragpicker) with that of the “resurrection-man” (i.e., body snatcher) 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#LITERARYREVIVALS" target="_self">“Literary Revivals”</a>, 331; <span class="persName-WMR">Rossetti</span>ʼs identity as author of this review noted in

               <div class="p">In the hands of <span class="persName-TWD">Watts‐Dunton,</span> this characterization of Shepherdʼs offense both descends into scurrilous abuse and is elevated to a challenge to Britainʼs national interests. 
                    If <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherdʼs</span> professed mission, according to his <span class="date-1876">1876</span> reply to the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum</i></span>, 
                    was to serve the interests of “poetical students” regardless of the “indifferen[ce of] the general public,” or even of the opposition of the author and the authorʼs relations, 
                    in order to publish comprehensive materials for studying the growth of the poetʼs mind 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#LITERARYGOSSIPDEC76" target="_self">“Mrs. Browningʼs Earlier Poems”,</a> 722), 
                    then the nationʼs interests demand that the editor of modern authorsʼ juvenilia and other “literary revivals” be put down. Exposed as a “vampire” and blood‐sucking “insect,” 
                    he must be denied autonomy, lest he exercise critical and creative authority over the writer, the writerʼs family, and the nation. 
                    Thus, <span class="persName-TWD">Watts‐Dunton,</span> apparently perceived his mission in the review as ostracizing <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd,</span> separating him from the “noble calling” of legitimate commerce with men of genius. 
                    The reprint editor is relegated to the fringe of professional letters as a mere scavenger; 
                    such a person “scans the book-stalls” for “some forgotten production, or some inchoate form of a known production of a famous writer,” 
                    and then attaches himself to a publisher or bookseller willing to abandon “the dignity of a noble calling” 
                    (“we wish to express our astonishment and regret that publishers <i>can</i> be found for such undertakings as this [reprint of Barrett juvenilia] and ‘<span class="title-ana-TENNYSONIANA">Tennysoniana</span>’“). 
                    Such a pair as this fallen publisher and his hack, advancing the “precocious smartness” of juvenilia in place of poetic genius, deserves the contempt of the “man of genius” 
                    (and even the “typical woman of poetic genius”). Any respectable author who is “about to print” and embody his genius in a printed book will do well to 
                    “pause and consider before he imperils his privileges as an English gentleman” by succumbing to “caterers of this kind”

                    to republication of <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett Browningʼs</span> juvenilia, quoting remarks that perhaps he had himself originally dictated to the journal—namely,

                    <span class="persName-EBB">Browning</span> informed the court: “‘<span class="persName-EBB">Mrs. Browning</span> would herself, had she been alive, have objected to the republication

                    the publisher, <span class="persName-EM">Moxon</span>, having destroyed most copies of the <span class="date-1852">1852</span> <i>Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</i> when the documents were revealed to be a forgery. 
                    <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span>ʼs introduction became widely available only in <span class="date-1881">1881</span> when <span class="persName-FJF">F. J. Furnivall</span> [<span class="date-1825-1910">1825–1910</span>] published it in the <span class="title-book-BROWNINGSOCIETYPAPERS"><i>Browning Societyʼs Papers</i></span>, 
                    and it became known by its now familiar title, the <i>Essay on Shelley</i>.

                    In the end <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> seems 
                    only to have helped the plaintiffʼs case by admitting not only that he failed to seek the permission of <span class="persName-PBS">Shelleyʼs</span> living descendant before publishing the introduction, 
                    but that he had even recognized the <span class="persName-PBS">Shelley</span> letters as forgeries when he undertook the project 
                    (quotations in <a href="/notes/bibliography#BROWNINGSTESTIMONY" target="_self"><span class="persName-PHONAN">Honan</span>, <span class="title-essay-BROWNINGSTESTIMONY">“Browningʼs Testimony”</span></a>, 28–29, 30).</div>
               
               <div class="p">For <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> scholars, the more significant issue presented by this episode is <span class="persName-RB">Browningʼs</span> confounding admission that he was aware that 
                    <span class="persName-EM">Moxonʼs</span> edition consisted of forgeries of <span class="persName-PBS">Shelleyʼs</span> letters, 
                    a testimony that scholars have attempted to explain in a more flattering light consistent with the poetʼs character. What is more to our purpose is the remark with which the rattled poet sought 
                    to redirect the cross‐examination to his principle point in having carried the <span class="title-essay-BROWNINGESSAYONSHELLEY"><i>Essay on Shelley</i></span> into court. As <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> explained: 
                    “‘My essay was on the character of <span class="persName-PBS">Shelley</span>, 
                    and I referred to these poems [e.g., “Queen Mab”] as those of an immature boyhood”’

                    For <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span>, the immaturity of the poet settles the debate a priori respecting the value of the poems, 
                    just as <span class="persName-TWD">Watts‐Dunton</span> in his review of <span class="title-book-BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878"><i>The Earlier Poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning</i></span> appeals to the “common‐sense” of the “judicious . . . British public” 
                    in settling judgments of literary value of works that are likely to benefit the nation 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#REVIEWBARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878" target="_self">Unsigned review of <span class="title-book-BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878"><i>The Earlier Poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning</i></span></a>, 765). 
                    By these “common-sense” standards, the poet maintains perpetual right over whatʼs in and whatʼs out, and <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherdʼs</span> claims for the independent judgment of the critic are nowhere. 
                    The <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum</i></span> incessantly reminded readers of a phrase tossed off by <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> in his <span class="date-1876">1876</span> reply to journal, 
                    his remark that he undertook his reprints for use by “poetical students” whose purposes would “doubtless be <i>caviare</i>” to “‘the general’” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#LITERARYGOSSIPDEC76" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-LITERARYGOSSIPDEC76">“Mrs. Browningʼs Earlier Poems”</span>,</a> 722). Seizing on the apparent elitism of the remark, 
                    <span class="persName-TWD">Watts‐Dunton</span> scoffed at a conception of the study of poetry that indulges “‘<i>caviare</i>’ at the expense of all the common amenities of life”

               <div class="p">In taking this common‐sense stance, <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> avoided the implications of <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherdʼs</span> cheeky quotation of the poet himself, when arguing for the value of early writing. 
                    As testimonial to the “nameless and peculiar charm” to be discovered the “bursting of bud and leaf of a new poetic genius,” 
                    <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> quotes <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> on the “‘exquisite touch’ that ‘bides in the birth of things’”, a line from

                    I have argued elsewhere that <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> did eventually answer <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> more thoughtfully about his opponentʼs appropriation from this poem, 
                    which meditates on how the poetic spirit engages with the material world. Here it is necessary to drive at the main point concerning the reception of <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherdʼs</span> poetics, 
                    which defended the value of a poetʼs juvenile writing in understanding the growth of the modern poetʼs mind—albeit a poetics ever so slightly developed in <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherdʼs</span> writing. 
                    Although the Wordsworthian tropes making up this hypothesis would have been more than familiar to every cultivated British reader by mid‐century, 
                    <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherdʼs</span> proposition of taking juvenilia seriously in the study of modern poetry provoked a furious reaction from the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum</i></span> that demands understanding.</div>
               
               <div class="p">Part of the disturbance appears owing to the recognition that, as already pointed out, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherdʼs</span> formulation is not quite Wordsworthian, in that the childʼs genius is not remembered and translated 
                    through the poetʼs mature inscription of spots of time, but rather directly communicated to the observer by the child writer. 
                    In the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeumʼs</i></span> review of <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherdʼs</span> edition of the <span class="persName-ML">Lamb</span>ʼs <span class="title-book-LAMBSPOETRY"><i>Poetry for Children</i></span>, 
                    the writer dwells on <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworthʼs</span> paradigm of loss, which forms the “inexplicable” 
                    but “impassable gulf” between “the adult mind and the mind of childhood”: “If it 
                    was by a sudden leap that we left behind us the ‘heaven’ that ‘lies about us in 
                    our infancy’—if we lost at one stoke all that sense of the wonderfulness of the 
                    wonderful, the beauty of the beautiful—all that intense belief in the 
                    personality of natural forces, all that close and tender intimacy with the lower 
                    animals, which go to make up that ‘heaven’—the existence of the world of dull 
                    dead darkness which has supplanted it would not be so inscrutable.” But despite the writerʼs mournfulness over the defectiveness of the adult mind that 
                    “it is [only] from without, and not from within, that . . . those landscapes of childhood” are perceptible, and despite his Dickensian tirade against the modern 
                    “stupid system of so‐called education” that deadens us by trampling on “the limitless 
                    potentialities of happiness in children,” it is clear that the writer is unwilling to relinquish the paradigm of loss of childhood, since it sponsors <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span>ʼs 
                    paradigm of recompense. The reviewer is consoled that the imaginative experience of literature in childhood forms an inalienable part of the psychological and spiritual self, 
                    because this formation is overseen by a Wordsworthian “literature of power” that insists on the childʼs subordination: 
                    “[I]t is impossible to calculate how enormous in moulding the mind is the power of infant literature. 
                    It is not merely that what we read in childhood we never forget, but that it becomes part of our very being.” “Infant literature” means writing <i>for</i> children by adults, 
                    not writing <i>by</i> children. The formation of the self, “our very being,” depends on a “literature of power” that guides but silences the child

               <div class="p">To <span class="persName-TWD">Watts‐Dunton,</span> the “inscrutable” imagination of the child, that “nameless and peculiar charm,” is likely to produce only “precocious smartness,” if confronted directly in a childʼs writing,

                    He does, however, maintain a circumscribed place of sentiment for the dead child writer of promise, 
                    drawing partly on the <a href="/notes/chatterton_thomas_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span></a> myth,

                    of a countryʼs literary potentialities,” by encouraging talent that would otherwise wither; “for . . . the violence of the [authorial] impulse subsides with the subsidence 
                    of the hot enthusiasms of youth”, and if the impulse “is long kept in check by adverse circumstances, the interests of the world come thicker and thicker, till, at last, that energy which—had 
                    the printing difficulty been early overcome—would have expressed itself in literature, is exhausted in other channels”

                    <span class="persName-TWD">Watts‐Duntonʼs</span> example of the child writer extinguished by circumstance is the erstwhile poet, <span class="persName-CJW">Charles Jeremiah Wells</span>, 
                    around whom the Pre‐Raphaelite circle had been constructing a myth of the neglected poet. In <span class="date-1875">1875</span>, <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne</span> published an appreciation of <span class="persName-CJW">Wells</span>, 
                    in which he presents the writerʼs first publication, the <i>Stories after Nature</i> (<span class="date-1822">1822</span>) as neglected juvenilia, “written it is said in his earliest youth”, 
                    although in fact <span class="persName-CJW">Wells</span> published the stories in his early twenties. <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne</span> characterizes the child author of the stories in terms 
                    similar to <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherdʼs</span> figuration of the child writer as an enigma of nature: “The first publication of <span class="persName-CJW">Mr. Wells</span> . . . has much of the charm 
                    and something of the weakness natural to the first flight and the first note of a song‐bird, whose wings have yet to grow, and whose notes have yet to deepen; 
                    yet in its first flutterings and twitterings there is a nameless grace, a beauty indefinable, which belongs only to the infancy of genius as it belongs only to the infancy of life”

               <div class="p">Unlike the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeumʼs</i></span> reviewer of the Lambsʼ <span class="title-book-LAMBSPOETRY"><i>Poetry for Children</i></span>, <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne</span> is willing to imagine the effect of 
                    imaginative writing by a child writer on the “a reader of the age at which this book was written”, 
                    and he seems to quote himself as just such a youthful reader moved by the impressive effect of these stories. 
                    (Although this review was published in <span class="date-1876">1876</span>, <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne</span> first submitted a version, unsuccessfully, to <i>Fraserʼs Magazine</i> in 1861; 
                    and his initial introduction to <span class="persName-CJW">Wells</span>ʼs writing probably dated from as early as <span class="date-1857">1857</span>, when he turned twenty and met <span class="persName-DGR">D. G. Rossetti</span>. 
                    Since <span class="date-1849">1849</span>, during the initial formation of the Pre‐Raphaelite Brotherhood, <span class="persName-DGR">Rossetti</span> had urged the members to regard <span class="persName-CJW">Wells</span>ʼs obscure closet drama, <i>Joseph and His Brethren</i> [<span class="date-1824">1824</span>], 
                    as a talismanic text, and <span class="persName-DGR">Rossetti</span> persisted in championing <span class="persName-CJW">Wells</span> through the <span class="date-1860-1869">1860s,</span> 
                    but dropped the cause in the <span class="date-1870-1879">1870s</span>, when <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne</span>, with whom <span class="persName-DGR">Rossetti</span> had quarreled, at last succeeded along with <span class="persName-TWD">Watts‐Dunton</span> and others in getting the play published 
                    [<a href="/notes/bibliography#BUTLERSHIBBOLETH" target="_self">Butler, “Pre‐Raphaelite Shibboleth”</a>, 78, 82–84].) 
                    <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne</span>ʼs alleged youthful response is scarcely suggestive, however, of an infant connection with a “nameless” and “indefinable” beauty that can belong “only to the infancy of genius”. 
                    While <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne</span> says his youthful self found the <i>Stories from Nature</i> “‘perfect in grace and power, tender and exquisite in choice of language’”, his early response also emphasized the storiesʼ 
                    “‘noble and masculine delicacy in feeling and purpose’”. The adult <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne</span> demurs over his early enthusiasm for this boyish but masculine writing, 
                    now demanding that a child reader of <span class="persName-CJW">Wells</span>ʼs stories, “if there be in him any critical judgment or any promise of such faculty to come,” discover that the stories “relish of a bastard graft”. 
                    Modeled on ʼs <span class="title-story-BOCCACCIODECAMERON"><i>Decameron</i></span>, 
                    the stories betray excesses of overwrought poetic prose and the influence of <span class="persName-JHLH">Leigh Hunt</span> 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#SWINBURNEUNKNOWNPOET" target="_self"><span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne</span>, <span class="title-essay-SWINBURNUNKNOWNPOET">“An Unknown Poet”</span></a>, 218).</div>
               
               <div class="p">Just so, <span class="persName-TWD">Watts‐Dunton</span> is alarmed by the possibilities opened up by imagining a Wordsworthian child of joy gaining access to a printer before the shades of the prison‐house can close in upon him. 
                    The only benefit of early publication, <span class="persName-TWD">Watts‐Dunton</span> decides, is to act as “a sort of safety‐valve or ‘air‐hole,’ 
                    from which escapes, to the great good of the producer, the balderdash engendered, like a bad gas, by the active forces of youth.” 
                    The child writer, instead of trailing clouds of glory, emits fatuous imagination—the advantage of such flights being that, in an age of steam, 
                    early printing at least allows for regulation of the excess energy, as in an engine. 
                    For according to the “economy of Nature” in an industrial age, when poets can begin publishing at age fourteen, “the more genius there is in any youthful brain 
                    the more nonsense” there is to be “got rid of”; and as an additional benefit to the nation, early printing purges the child writerʼs impressionable imitations of others. 
                    Just as <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburneʼs</span> infant critic recognizes, “on taking up the little book [by <span class="persName-CJW">Wells</span>] again in after years,” the undue “perceptible influence of <span class="persName-JHLH">Leigh Hunt</span>,” so 
                    <span class="persName-TWD">Watts‐Dunton,</span> finds belabored in child writing “the quintessential amalgam of the literary vices of many predecessors.” 
                    The proper “education of the poet consists not in learning, but in unlearning,” he pronounces; 
                    and early printing at least enables the nationʼs youthful writers to unlearn all the sooner, just as the previous generation needed to rid itself of 
                    “the concentrated essence of the sentimentality and fustian which infested the literary atmosphere of this country 
                    during the reign of <span class="persName-SJP">Samuel Jackson Pratt</span>”
