               <div class="p">Scottish poet and fiction writer. <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> was familiarly known as the <span class="persName-pen_name-JH">“Ettrick Shepherd”</span>, owing to his youth spent as a shepherd in <span class="geogName-ETTRICKFOREST">Ettrick Forest</span>. 
                    Later, when a successful writer, he returned to the area, dividing his time between <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span> literary life and a farm, <span class="placeName-building-ALTRIVE">Altrive</span>, 
                    in the <span class="geogName-YARROWVALLEY">Yarrow Valley</span> in the <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scottish Borders</span>

                    The farm lay near to <span class="placeName-building-ABBOTSFORD">Abbotsford</span>, the residence of <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>ʼs friend, the novelist <a href="/notes/scott_walter_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span></a>, in 
                    <span class="placeName-SELKIRSHIRE">Selkirkshire</span>.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">As a writer, <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> was important to the young <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> as representative of a pastoral and legend‐filled 
                    imagining of <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>. Whereas the Brontë siblings viewed <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> 
                    as a colorful, colloquial contributor to the dramatized repartee 
                    of the <span class="title-essay-NOCTESAMBROSIANAE">“Noctes Ambrosianae”</span> of <span class="title-periodical-BLACKWOODMAGAZINE"><i>Blackwoodʼs Edinburgh Magazine</i></span>—an 
                    influence on the childrenʼs collaborative and competitive writing, and an encouragement 
                    to “bravado” and “swagger” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#ALEXANDERREADERSANDWRITERS" target="_self">Alexander, <span class="title-essay-ALEXANDERREADERSANDWRITERS">“Readers and Writers”</span></a>, 62, 67)—<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                    knew <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> as a contributor 
                    to the <a href="/notes/annuals_note" target="_self">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</a>, 
                    such as <a href="/notes/friendships_offering_note" target="_self"><span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span></a>, 
                    in which the author conveyed a georgic and poetic view of the <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> landscape. 
                    Connected with this view of <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>ʼs unworldliness was also his otherworldliness, as imparting Scotch legend and fairy lore 
                    (see <a href="/notes/fairies_note" target="_self">Tales about Fairies and Other Spirits</a>). At the same time, 
                    and in part because of this perception of <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> turned to him for advice about 
                    bringing forward <span class="persName-JR">John</span>, the boy poet, as a published writer; and therefore <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> 
                    also contributed significantly to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs expectations about the print culture of his youth,

                    when he undertook his first visit to <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> 
                    (specifically, probably between <span class="date-1832-01-14-1832-02-19">14 January and 19 February</span>, 
                    when <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> had come home from business travel [see

                    and even more likely between <span class="date-1832-01-14-1832-02-08">14 January and 8 February</span>, <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs birthday, as explained below).
                    According to a <span class="date-1832-02-09">9 February 1832</span> letter thanking <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> for his subscription to a proposed publication, <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> 
                    appears to have met <span class="persName-MR">Mrs. Ruskin</span> and <span class="persName-JR">John</span>, 
                    but does not mention <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs cousin, <span class="persName-MBR">Mary Richardson</span>. 
                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>ʼs purpose in coming to <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> 
                    was to arrange for a collected edition of his prose fiction, the <span class="title-book-ALTRIVETALES"><i>Altrive Tales</i></span>.
                    His mission was tied to a phenomenon in British book publishing of the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> and <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>, 
                    the production of accessibly priced, but well produced, uniform editions of collected works of modern British writers.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> had long sought to publish a collected edition of his tales, which would complement his two collected editions of poetry, 
                    but he was now emboldened by the success of a new plan pursued by his friend, 
                    <a href="/notes/scott_walter_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span> (<span class="date-1771-1832">1771–1832</span>)</a>, 
                    and by <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs publisher, <span class="persName-TCP">Robert Cadell</span> (<span class="date-1788-1849">1788–1849</span>). 
                    Hoping to tap into a popular market, <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span> and <span class="persName-TCP">Cadell</span> conceived the <span class="title-series-SCOTTMAGNUM">Magnum Opus</span> edition of the Waverley novels, 
                    which offered consumers monthly volumes of accessibly priced, yet handsomely produced, uniform volumes of the novels, each freshened with a new preface by the author, 
                    and each embellished with a few engraved illustrations.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">At the very modest price of five or six shillings per volume, the success of the scheme depended on high‐volume sales to a broad market. 
                    <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs venture, which began in <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, proved so successful that other publishers soon repeated the experiment by profitably 
                    reprinting the works of other popular authors. The marketing plan was supported by innovations in printing, especially mass‐producible illustration using steel engraving, 
                    which supported a boom trade in <a href="/notes/annuals_note" target="_self">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</a> aimed at the middle class. 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself would debut in <span class="date-1834">1834</span> as a writer for this trade.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>ʼs <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> publisher, James Cochrane, had produced such an edition, collecting <span class="date-1701-1800">eighteenth‐century</span> British novelists, 
                    and <span class="persName-JCP">Cochrane</span> promised <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> the services of that editionʼs well‐known illustrator, 
                    <a href="/notes/cruikshank_george_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-GC">George Cruikshank</span> (<span class="date-1792-1878">1792–1878</span>)</a>. 
                    Regrettably, the venture came to grief because Cochrane went bankrupt. 
                    The publisher ultimately managed to produce one volume of the projected edition of <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>ʼs tales, 
                    a volume that contained not only three of the tales but also (and a precursor to what became a characteristic feature in collected editions of modern writers) an 
                    autobiographical “Memoir”  by the author; a portrait engraving of <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>, which served as the volumeʼs frontispiece 
                    (created by <span class="persName-CFENGRAVER">Charles Fox</span> [<span class="date-1794-1849">1794–1849</span>], an artist who 
                    had contributed illustrations to <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs <span class="title-series-SCOTTMAGNUM">Magnum Opus</span> edition); and a cut by <span class="persName-GC">Cruikshank</span> illustrating one of the tales 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#HUGHESHOGGLIFE" target="_self"><span class="persName-GH">Hughes</span>, <span class="title-book-HUGHESHOGGLIFE"><i>James Hogg</i></span></a>, 222–23, 265–66, 281, 287;

                  <div class="p">Later, when <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> returned to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> following Cochraneʼs failure, 
                    the author negotiated with a <span class="placeName-GLASGOW">Glasgow</span> publisher, Blackie & Son, who arranged for a reprint series of the fiction, 
                    by employing the <span class="placeName-GLASGOW">Glasgow</span> system of “numbers” publishing. In this scheme, books were published in segments, 
                    issued monthly in paper covers, so that the consumer of modest means could compile complete volumes over time with small outlays 
                    (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#HUGHESINTROHOGGLETTERSVOL3" target="_self">Hughes, <span class="title-essay-HUGHESINTROHOGGLETTERSVOL3">introduction to Hogg, <span class="title-book-HUGHESINTROHOGGLETTERSVOL3"><i>Letters, <span class="date-1832-1835">1832–1835</span></i></span></span></a>, xxxix–xl). 
                    In <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>ʼs case, the resulting six volumes of fiction published by Blackie & Son proved a far cry from the uniform edition of the 
                    <span class="title-book-HOGGALTRIVETALES"><i>Altrive Tales</i></span>, modeled on <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs <span class="title-series-SCOTTMAGNUM">Magnum Opus</span> edition.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">These ambitions and disappointments concerning publishing arrangements are relevant to the Ruskinsʼ acquaintance with <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>, 
                    because the writer became embroiled in these difficulties in the years leading up to 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs own introduction to the professional <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> literary world as 
                    “<span class="persName-pen_name-JR">J.R.</span>” 
                    In <span class="date-1829">1829</span> and <span class="date-1830">1830</span>, two poems by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> based on his <a href="/apparatuses/on_skiddaw_and_derwentwater_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER">“On Skiddaw and Derwent Water”</span></a> 
                    had already appeared in the <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span>; however, this magazine, which was published by the Ruskinsʼ clergyman and <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs tutor, 
                    <a href="/notes/andrews_edward_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-EA">Edward Andrews</span> (<span class="date-1787-1841">1787–1841</span>)</a>, 
                    amounted almost to a family affair. The boyʼs continuing facile and prolific poetry composition gave promise of a more ambitious and prominent staging of his talents, 
                    and doubtless <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> was keenly observant to learn how publishers operated.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">As <span class="persName-GH">Gillian Hughes</span> remarks, <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>ʼs disappointed expectations reflect the transition between publishing in the age of <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span> and 
                    the more volatile and confusing print culture in the age of <span class="persName-CJHD">Dickens</span>. 
                    Cochraneʼs collapse, which occurred only <span class="date-1832">six years after the bank failures of <span class="date-1826">1826</span></span> 
                    had already ruined many publishers, represented the riskier possibilities 
                    in publishing that were opening up alongside apparently solid houses like John Murray and <a href="/notes/smith_elder_note" target="_self">Smith, Elder</a>. 
                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> presents an exemplary figure for authorship during this transitional period. 
                    He was willing to experiment with new ways to reach his public; and despite his relative isolation on his <span class="placeName-building-ALTRIVE">Altrive farm</span>, 
                    he had become a literary celebrity by embracing new modes of publication. At the same time, <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> expressed doubts about the effects of cheap publication 
                    on “legitimate literature”. His attitudes were colored not only by his personal professional triumphs and disappointments 
                    in his ongoing struggle to support his family—high fame coupled with great risk, as mirrored in the career of his more august friend, <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>—but also 
                    by his hardening Toryism, which resulted from adverse personal experiences during the countryʼs disturbances over the <span class="date-1832">1832</span> Reform Bill 
                    (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#HUGHESINTROHOGGLETTERSVOL3" target="_self"><span class="persName-GH">Hughes</span>, <span class="title-essay-HUGHESINTROHOGGLETTERSVOL3">introduction to <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>, <span class="title-book-HUGHESINTROHOGGLETTERSVOL3"><i>Letters, <span class="date-1832-1835">1832–1835</span></i></span></span></a>, xli, xxxviii–xxxix).</div>

                    was pleasurable and flattering, as the <span class="persName-pen_name-JH">Ettrick Shepherd</span> was widely feted as a literary celebrity—especially, 
                    though not exclusively, among Scottish residents. 
                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> was known for his poetry and fiction, but he was perhaps most famous for his association with a character, the “<span class="persName-pen_name-JH">Shepherd</span>”, 
                    in the <span class="title-essay-NOCTESAMBROSIANAE"><i>Noctes Ambrosianae</i></span> series in the <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span> periodical, 
                    <span class="title-periodical-BLACKWOODMAGAZINE"><i>Blackwoodʼs Magazine</i></span>. In his first visit to the metropolis, <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> was ready to take control over his own public persona. 
                    He had already unsettled the complacency of <span class="title-periodical-BLACKWOODMAGAZINE"><i>Blackwoodʼs</i></span> by pursuing 
                    the offer by the <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> publisher, Cochrane, 
                    to take on the edition of the <span class="title-book-HOGGALTRIVETALES"><i>Altrive Tales</i></span>. Now he sent contributions to a new <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> periodical, <span class="title-periodical-FRASERMAGAZINE"><i>Fraserʼs Magazine</i></span>, 
                    which had set out in <span class="date-1830">1830</span> to rival specifically <span class="title-periodical-BLACKWOODMAGAZINE"><i>Blackwoodʼs Magazine</i></span>. 
                    The connection with <span class="title-periodical-FRASERMAGAZINE"><i>Fraserʼs</i></span> was especially gratifying for <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> 
                    in that the metropolitan periodical did not balk at his irreverence and bawdiness—always

                    Cochraneʼs solvency, so <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>ʼs friends attempted to raise funds for the writer. 
                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> refused charity, but he consented to a scheme for publication by subscription of a new deluxe edition of

                     <div class="p">Surely the symbolism was not lost on <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> that he dated his donation on his sonʼs <span class="date-1832-02-08">thirteenth birthday</span>. 
                        Likely he not only saw himself as making an investment in modern Caledonian poetry on <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs behalf; 
                        he probably fondly hoped he was investing in <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs own future as a poet. Moreover, the projected form of the book, a 
                    deluxe edition of an established modern classic, reflected the success of another illustrated edition of modern poetry, 
                    which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> is believed to have received on that same <span class="date-1832-02-08">thirteenth birthday</span>—the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> edition of 
                    <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> by <a href="/notes/rogers_samuel_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-SR">Samuel Rogers</span>ʼs (<span class="date-1763">1763</span>–<span class="date-1855">1855</span></a>), 
                    which was illustrated by <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="persName-JMWT">J. M. W. Turner</span></a>, 
                    <a href="/notes/stothard_thomas_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-TSP">Thomas Stothard</span></a>, and others. 
                        With his assertively generous donation, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> was taking as direct a part as he could in a distinctly contemporary mode of book production aimed at politely learned middle‐class consumers like himself. 
                    Ultimately, the hapless venture of the deluxe <span class="title-poem-HOGGTHEQUEENSWAKE"><i>Queenʼs Wake</i></span> gift book proved a stark contrast with the best‐seller status of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs illustrated <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> and 
                    his <span class="date-1834">1834</span> collected <span class="title-book-ROGERSPOEMS1834"><i>Poems</i></span>, also illustrated by <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>. The setback of <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>ʼs fortunes did not dampen <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs ambitions, however, 
                        for he bided his time to follow up on his claim on <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>ʼs gratitude. (For a definition of the Victorian <i>gift book</i> see

                     <div class="p">Meantime, <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> replied to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> that he felt “queer” accepting such a generous donation but admitted to his pressing financial need. 
                        The gift emboldened <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> to write to <span class="persName-JGL">John Gibson Lockhart</span> (<span class="date-1794-1854">1794–1854</span>), the influential editor and the son‐in‐law of <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>, 
                    nudging him with ideas for the gift book. (The impetus for the deluxe <span class="title-poem-HOGGTHEQUEENSWAKE"><i>Queenʼs Wake</i></span> was formally led by the prestigious 
                    publishing firm headed by another Scot, <span class="persName-JM">John Murray</span>, 
                    for whom <span class="persName-JGL">Lockhart</span> worked as the editor of the <span class="title-periodical-QUARTERLYREVIEW"><i>Quarterly Review</i></span>.) 
                    Cannily, <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> insinuated terms for the book, which, he wrote, “should be a work something like <span class="title-annual-KEEPSAKE">The Keepsake</span> 
                    with fewer ornaments yet so as to make it a drawing‐room book”

                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>ʼs description shows that he wanted to take advantage of the fashion 
                    for <a href="/notes/annuals_note" target="_self">literary annuals</a>, 
                        but by specifying “fewer ornaments” he perhaps meant that the publication would appear less feminine, 
                        as annuals were perceived to be intended for the ladyʼs boudoir, rather than for the “drawing‐room”. 
                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>ʼs citing the <span class="title-annual-KEEPSAKE"><i>Keepsake</i></span> as an example may refer to its distinctively feminine ornament 
                        of a silk cover for the boards, which set a fashion for other annualsʼ covers; he may also have been strategically hinting at the <span class="title-annual-KEEPSAKE"><i>Keepsake</i></span>ʼs reputation as the costliest and most elegant of the many annuals crowding the market, 
                        and as the most lucrative for authors, having paid <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span> £500 for only two slight contributions

                    This publication did come to fruition, and <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> was doubtless flattered to be listed among subscribers who included members of the aristocracy, 
                    well‐known artists, and other successful professional men. Earlier in the year, he must have been equally proud to lead the way 
                    among prosperous Scottish <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> merchants in supporting <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>ʼs book, an elegant expression of modern Caledonian poetry. 
                    Nonetheless, while <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>ʼs book proved auspicious in helping <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> to envision his own place in the British print production of art and poetry in the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>

                    the example of <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>ʼs ill‐fated <span class="title-poem-HOGGTHEQUEENSWAKE"><i>Queenʼs Wake</i></span> subscription edition must have worked in part as a cautionary tale. 
                    The fading away of the deluxe <span class="title-poem-HOGGTHEQUEENSWAKE"><i>Queenʼs Wake</i></span>, 
                    along with the compromised plans for the <span class="title-book-ALTRIVETALES"><i>Altrive Tales</i></span> edition, posed an inverse complement to <span class="persName-TBM">Thomas Macaulay</span>ʼs 
                    encomium to the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> illustrated <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, which, were it “dug up in some <span class="placeName-POMPEII">Pompeii</span> or <span class="placeName-HERCULANEUM">Herculaneum</span>

                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> retaliated with satirical verses on the editors of annuals, declaring, in an <span class="date-1831">1831</span> poem for <span class="title-periodical-BLACKWOODMAGAZINE"><i>Blackwoodʼs Magazine</i></span>, 
                    that “I donʼt like <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>, heʼs too finical, / And so pragmatical about his slaves”

                    & a highland bonnet & plaid lying beside him”; the boy is “lying in the midst of a scene of wild magnificence” among “woods, hills and waterfalls”.

                    “of talent and of heart”, who has nonetheless reaped misfortune and abuse along with his fame.

                    his lifeʼs work having fallen victim to an insecure publishing scheme. “I should like to see your works coming forward in better hands”, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> concludes, 
                    referring to the debacle of Cochraneʼs bankruptcy.

                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> having made such an offer also to the young daughter of his publisher, <span class="persName-JCP">James Cochrane</span>. 
                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> loved children and wielded great charm over them, and he appears to have thought of such visits as invigorating holidays for country‐starved city children 
                    in the company of his own “noisy romping healthy brats but good learners”

                    On <span class="date-1834-02-13">13 February 1834</span>, <span class="persName-JR">John</span> wrote to decline <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>ʼs invitation, explaining that he could not “make up [his] mind to leave [his] parents even for a short time” 
                    until he went to university, and that his parents were “equally tenacious” of him. Writing of what might have been, however, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> summons an idyllic myth 
                    that frames the nurturing of the emergent writer in a georgic or pastoral setting, like the landscape surrounding <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>ʼs <span class="title-poem-">“Minstrel Boy”</span>. 
                    Such mythology probably underwrote <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs motives in appealing 
                    to the <span class="persName-pen_name-JH">Ettrick Shepherd</span> as a man of “heart” as well as talent.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">As <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrote nostalgically to <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> about “the blue hills” of <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>, 
                    among which he had “passed some of the happiest days of [his] short life”, he was doubtless thinking 
                    of visits to his fatherʼs family in <a href="/notes/perth_note" target="_self">Perth</a> during the

                    These times in the “North Countrie” were “exceedingly pleasant”, but “can never more return” to him, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> explains to <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> as if already well traveled in the paths of sentiment; and having framed this ballad‐like yearning, he goes on to imagine sojourning in the Border country, 
                    “the braes of <span class="geogName-YARROWVALLEY">Yarrow</span>, and the banks of <span class="geogName-TWEEDRIVER">Tweed</span>”, in the company of <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>ʼs bairns somewhat in the fantastic manner of one of <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>ʼs supernatural tales, 
                    in which a youth wakes among the fairies, as in <span class="title-poem-HOGGKILMENY"><i>Kilmeny</i></span>: it would “be more than [he] can well tell of pleasure” to be able to  
                    to wander among the holmes and hills of lovely <span class="placeName-ETTRICK">Ettrick</span> with”

                    very much of their celebrity, and to find brothers in his children (for if the children have the loving‐kindness of the father 
                    they would be sisters and brothers to me)”

                    “80 or 100 lines” that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> had sent as a sample—lines therefore written in <span class="date-1834-01">January 1834</span> or somewhat earlier, it appears, and possibly intended for
