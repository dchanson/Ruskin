               <div class="p">Librairie Galignani was a Paris‐based English‐language publisher, bookseller, and circulating library, 
                    which supplied British travelers with newspapers, magazines, and books. During the tour of <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span> in <span class="date-1833">1833</span>, 
                    for example, when <span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span> suffered a minor illness, his father and his cousin, 
                    <a href="/notes/#richardson_mary_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span></a>, 
                    cheered him up by finding “some English books from a library” along with “2 or 3 volumes of 
                    <span class="title-periodical-GALIGNANISMAGAZINE">Gaglianiʼs [<i>sic</i>] Magazine</span>” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFT48" target="_self"><span class="title-transcript-RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</span></a>, 106). 
                    The magazine was one of two monthly journals published by the firm, the <span class="title-periodical-GALIGNANIREPERTORY"><i>Repertory</i></span> 
                    (ca. <span class="date-1807-1825">1807–25</span>) or  
                    <span class="title-periodical-GALIGNANISMAGAZINE"><i>Galignaniʼs Monthly Review and Magazine</i></span> 
                    (ca. <span class="date-1822-1825">1822–25</span>). There was also a daily, 
                    the <span class="title-periodical-GALIGNANIMESSENGER"><i>Messenger</i></span> 
                    (ca. <span class="date-1814-1904">1814–1904</span>) 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#BARBERGALIGNANI" target="_self"><span class="persName-GBARBER">Barber</span>, <span class="title-essay-BARBERGALIGNANI">“Galignaniʼs and the Publication of English Books in France”</span></a>, 269, 284, 272–74).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Among its book publications, Galignani issued the series 
                    <span class="title-series-STANDARDMODERNNOVELS"><i>Standard Modern Novels and Romances</i></span>, 
                    which entertained English travelers and expatriates with contemporary British poetry and prose. 
                    The editions were issued in duodecimo, a size convenient for travel, but printed using excellent type and engravings, 
                    and edited for correct and complete text—in some cases, text more complete and reliable than what could be found in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> editions. 
                    As piracies, the volumes were priced significantly cheaper than corresponding <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> editions, 
                    and sold in paper‐covered boards—disposable volumes that could be shared among travelers at a hotel and left behind for othersʼ enjoyment

                    an edition that, at the time of publication, was superior to any British edition of <span class="persName-PBS">Percy Shelley</span> as well as providing
