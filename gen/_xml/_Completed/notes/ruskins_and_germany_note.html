               <div class="p">The attitude toward German culture reflected in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs early travel writing is divided between Romantic attraction to German legends and landscape 
                    and haughty condescension to its people. In the <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</span></a>, 
                    German romance colors the poetry, while invective against German vulgarity flashes out in the essays, such as 
                    <a href="/witnesses/ehrenbreitstein_prose_msviii" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-JREHRENBREITSTEINPROSE">“It is said that French will carry you over all <span class="placeName-EUROPE">Europe</span>” [“Ehrenbreitstein”]</span></a>,

               <div class="p">The Ruskins first visited <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span> during the <a href="/notes/tour_of_1833_note" target="_self">Tour of 1833</a>. Leading up to that journey,
                    <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> purchased books about the region in <span class="date-1831">1831</span> and <span class="date-1832">1832</span>, which are unidentified; 
                    a work by <span class="persName-JCFS">Friedrich Schiller</span> in <span class="date-1832">1832</span>; and a German dictionary and a grammar, respectively in <span class="date-1832">1832</span> and <span class="date-1833">1833</span>. 
                    Following their return from the tour, he acquired a “P. Rhine” in <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, which was probably 
                    <span class="title-book-BULWERLYTTONPILGRIMS"><i>The Pilgrims of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span></i></span> 
                    by <span class="persName-EBL">Edward Bulwer‐Lytton</span> (<span class="date-1803-1873">1803–73</span>), published in that year
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 230 n. 2, 260 n. 2, 286 n. 1). 
                    In visual culture, <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span> and the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> provided prominent subjects in engravings, lithographs, 
                    and watercolors by the Ruskinsʼ favorite artists, <a href="/notes/prout_samuel_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-SP">Samuel Prout</span></a>, 
                    <a href="/notes/turner_j_m_w_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-JMWT">J. M. W. Turner</span></a>, and others.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Despite this interest, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs parents had always regarded German culture with ambivalence. In his youth, at age sixteen 
                    in <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> had acted a part in an amateur staging of 
                    <span class="title-drama-"><i>Castle Spectre</i></span> (<span class="date-1797">1797</span>) by <span class="persName-MGL">Matthew Gregory (“Monk”) Lewis</span> 
                    (<span class="date-1775-1818">1775–1818</span>), the most lionized and yet most reviled British imitator of the German terrible sublime. As Ruskin family lore had it 
                    according to <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERTIA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs performance stirred his future fiancée, 
                    <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>, with admirmation of the handsome figure he cut onstage in his romantic costume, despite her religious antipathy to “theatricals” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <i><span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span></i></a>, 38). In the course of their long engagement, however, 
                    <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> came round to <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs contempt for the Gothic sublime. In a letter of 
                    <span class="title-letter-"><span class="date-1813-03-04">4 March 1813</span></span> (part of which is missing), <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> satirizes 
                    <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>ʼs <span class="title-poem-SCOTTROKEBY"><i>Rokeby</i></span>, in which “bloodthirsty” characters 
                    “always threaten & announce more than they perform”, whereas the sentimental boy <span class="persName-fictional-WILFRIDWYCLIFFE">Wilfrid</span> 
                    “is very tender hearted, mild, shy, innocent, amorous, & sickly, very studious moreover”, prone to “sitting up all night hearing the wind howl & 
                    looking at the moon”, instead of “going like other folks to bed” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self">Burd, ed., <i><span class="title-book-RFL">Ruskin Family Letters</span></i></a>, 60). 
                    The description of <span class="persName-fictional-WILFRIDWYCLIFFE">Wilfrid</span> is prophetic of the teenage <span class="persName-JR">John</span> twenty years later; 
                    at the time, however, the epithet “sickly” was grimly applied to German drama by British critics, who warned that the importation of these plays would expose the British public 
                    to political subversion and moral depravity.</div>
               
               <div class="p">Starting in the <span class="date-1790-1799">1790s</span> and extending through the <span class="date-1799-11-09-1815-06-18">Napoleonic Era</span>, 
                    British fears of invasion by the French extended to anxieties about “contamination” by German romance, which was imported in the form of translations of tragedies and melodramas 
                    by <span class="persName-JCFS">Schiller</span>, <span class="persName-AFFK">Kotzebue</span>, and <span class="persName-JWG">Goethe</span>, and of translations and adaptations of Romantic 
                    ballads such as <span class="title-poem-BURGERLENORE">“Lenore”</span> by <span class="persName-GAB">G. A. Bürger</span>. As <span class="persName-PM">Peter Mortensen</span> 
                    has argued, British authors attracted to the German sublime in drama and the ballad had to reckon with a British xenophobic reaction, while at the same time capitalizing on the fashion 
                    for German literary supernaturalism (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MORTENSENEUROPHOBIA" target="_self"><span class="title-book-MORTENSENEUROPHOPIA"><i>British Romanticism and Continental Influences</i></span></a>, 26–27, 46). 
                    <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span> was caught in this dilemma early in his career as a poet, when <span class="persName-MGL">Lewis</span> invited him to contribute 
                    his translations of German ballads to the collection, <span class="title-anthology-LEWISTALESOFWONDER"><i>Tales of Wonder</i></span> (<span class="date-1800">1800</span>). 
                    <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span> did not, however, take the risk of appearing among scandalous and allegedly “Jacobinical” company merely for the sake of success in the literary market; 
                    like some other British poets, such as <span class="persName-RS">Robert Southey</span>, <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span> was drawn to German poetry in the belief that it shared 
                    a common heritage with Scottish poetry, and that the fashion for the German sublime could aid in the renewal of British poetry, which he considered moribund. 
                    For <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, this ideological orientation to the past seems a significant, if indirect connection with German Romantic literary culture 
                    than is apparent in the superficial prejudice against “German brains” that he gathered from his father.</div>
               
               <div class="p">For <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>, this ideological tie to <span class="persName-MGL">Lewis</span> and the German sublime is revealed in the series of biographical prefaces 
                    he added to his major poems in <span class="date-1830">1830</span>, starting with the <span class="title-essay-SCOTTESSAYONIMITATIONS">“Essay on Imitations of the Ancient Ballad”</span> 
                    prefacing the fourth volume of <span class="title-anthology-SCOTTMINSTRELSY"><i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i></span>. By this time, German literature had shed its stigma 
                    for British readers, and <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span> was able to disassociate his youthful pursuit from French political freethinking. His study of German language and poetics brought an 
                    “unexpected discovery of an old friend in a foreign land”, which promised an “emancipation from the rules so servilely adhered to by the French school, . . . 
                    particularly by their dramatic poets”; and while this affiliation brought “some disadvantages” in the form of German “extravagance and bombast”, 
                    <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span> and his associates in <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span> anticipated that the “prevailing taste in . . . 
                    [<span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span>] might be easily employed as a formidable auxiliary to renewing the spirit of our own, upon the same system as when medical persons 
                    attempt, by the transfusion of blood, to pass into the veins of an aged and exhausted patient, the vivacity of the circulation and liveliness of sensation which distinguish a young subject”. 
                    <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs access to this new blood was fortuitously encouraged by his acquaintance with <span class="persName-MGL">“Monk” Lewis</span>, 
                    whose “education abroad” had afforded “an opportunity of indulging his inclination for the extraordinary and supernatural, by wandering through the whole enchanted land 
                    of German faëry and <i>diablerie</i>, not forgetting the paths of her enthusiastic tragedy and romantic poetry”. <span class="persName-MGL">Lewis</span>ʼs 
                    influence could help add “a new string to the British harp”, as he was already a popularly “successful imitator of the Germans, both in his attachment to the ancient ballad, 
                    and in the tone of superstition which they [the German poets] willingly mingle with it”; and he was a “martinet, if I may so term him, in the accuracy of rhymes and of numbers” 
                    and his “command over the melody of verse” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#SCOTTESSAYONIMITATIONS" target="_self"><span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>, <span class="title-essay-SCOTTESSAYONIMITATIONS">“Essay on Imitations of the Ancient Ballad”</span>, ed. Thomson</a>, n.p.).</div>
               
               <div class="p">Other participants in this movement included <span class="persName-RS">Robert Southey</span>, whose ballads in an ancient style were admired by the Norwich School 
                    of poets, which included the most successful English translator of <span class="persName-GAB">Bürger</span>ʼs <span class="title-poem-BURGERLENORE">“Lenore”</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-WTPOET">William Taylor</span> (<span class="date-1765-1836">1765–1836</span>). <span class="persName-DCHANDLER">David Chandler</span> 
                    has illuminated how this context brings into focus <span class="persName-RS">Southey</span>ʼs rivalry with <span class="persName-STC">S. T. Coleridge</span> over the ballad revival, 
                    which has been perceived as merely personal in its motivation on <span class="persName-RS">Southey</span>ʼs part. In his approach to literary revival, <span class="persName-RS">Southey</span>ʼs 
                    “recipe for a modern supernatural ballad”, <span class="persName-DCHANDLER">Chandler</span> explains, “was to take a genuinely old story concerned with a supernatural event 
                    and to write it as if with complete faith in its credibility, ‘in the spirit of the elder poets’”. It was in defense of this approach that <span class="persName-RS">Southey</span> 
                    scorned <span class="persName-STC">Coleridge</span>ʼs <span class="title-poem-STCANCIENTMARINER">“The Ancient Mariner”</span> 
                    as “a Dutch attempt at German sublimity”. <span class="persName-DCHANDLER">Chandler</span> concludes that “what <span class="persName-RS">Southey</span> 
                    with professional rivalry dismissed as a ‘Dutch attempt’, and <span class="persName-CLE">[Charles] Lamb</span> more generously defended as an ‘English attempt’ 
                    at ‘German sublimity’, is a poem [‘<span class="title-poem-STCANCIENTMARINER">The Ancient Mariner</span>’] particularly apt for critics who read the past as continuous with the present 
                    and believe in the power of tradition. On the other hand, <span class="persName-RS">Southey</span>ʼs ‘answer’, an attempt at genuine ‘German sublimity’ 
                    [his ballad, <span class="title-poem-">‘The Old Woman of Berkeley’</span>], is a poem for critics who see the past as discontinuous with the present, 
                    but recoverable in part through an effort of difficult, but rewarding, sympathetic identification” 
                    (<span class="persName-DCHANDLER">Chandler</span>, <a href="/notes/bibliography#CHANDLERSOUTHEYSGERMANSUBLIMITY" target="_self">“<span class="title-essay-CHANDLERSOUTHEYSGERMANSUBLIMITY">Southeyʼs ‘German Sublimity’ and Coleridgeʼs ‘Dutch Attempt’”</span></a>, pars. 12, 15).</div>
               
               <div class="p">Despite <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs abiding dismissiveness of German “metaphysics”, this contest of ideas presents an intriguing background 
                    against which to compare his mature thinking about tradition and revivalism. In his youth, however, such ideas lay beyond the simpler conflicts in his attitudes about the German culture 
                    he encountered abroad. He had always been strongly drawn to the Gothic elements in <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>ʼs 
                    <span class="title-drama-BYRONMANFRED"><i>Manfred</i></span> and <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY"><i>Monastery</i></span> 
                    and the poems. Nonetheless, he parroted his fatherʼs contempt for German tourists encountered during the <a href="/notes/tour_of_1833_note" target="_self">Tour of 1833</a>, 
                    whom <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> caricatured as a “Nation” supposed to be “fond of the sublime & beautiful & terrific” 
                    and “proverbially Lovers of the horrible”, but whom he regarded as “a very coarse & yet very sentimental people”. If Germans seek sublime horror, 
                    he wrote in his diary, it must be “the horrors of Indigestion” that they most feel “as they are great Gormandizers”. If they are a sentimental people, 
                    their “Sentiment is not at all of a soft or tender or refining nature”, for “they are not polite [but] sometimes extremely rude” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFMS33A" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-RFMS33A">Diary of John James Ruskin, 1833–46</span></a>, 25). These remarks 
                    about the contradictory and self‐thwarting nature of a debased love of the sublime and unsentimental sentiment are consistent with <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs 
                    ridicule of German Romantic aesthetics that can be found in his letters twenty years earlier.</div>
