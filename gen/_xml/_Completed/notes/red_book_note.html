               <div class="p">The term <i>Red Book</i> was used by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and his parents to refer to his store‐bought 
                    stationerʼs notebooks with reddish‐brown, flexible leather covers (described specifically as <i>roan</i> in Sotheby & Co., <span class="title-catalogue-SOTHEBYCAT1930"><i>Catalogue of the Manuscripts and Remaining Library of John Ruskin</i></span> [<span class="date-1930">1930</span>], 20–21), 
                    each approximately 15 centimeters tall by 10 centimeters wide. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and <span class="persName-JJR">his father</span> exchange the term in referring, for example, 
                    to <a href="/apparatuses/msiii_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a> (<a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1829-03-10_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-jr_to_jjr_1829-03-10">letter of <span class="date-1829-03-10">10 March 1829</span></span></a>
                    [<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 192]). Presumably, the term extended 
                    to all the notebooks fitting this description: that is, as presently known and extant,
                    <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>,

               <div class="p">The term was perhaps a family jest. According to the <span class="title-dictionary-OED"><i>OED</i></span>, 
                    <i>red book</i> applies to “official books, usually distinguished by having a red binding, of political, administrative, or economic significance”, 
                    a usage current since the fifteenth century (“red book, n.1”, <i>OED Online</i>, accessed <span class="date-2015-12-30">30 December 2015</span>). 
                    It is also possible, however, that the Ruskins used the term merely to refer to the color.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">It is tempting to speculate that the Red Books were purchased at <a href="/notes/smith_elder_note" target="_self">Smith, Elder, & Company</a>, 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs future publisher, since the firmʼs primary trade in its early days was stationery supplies, 
                    and <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> was a steady customer at the shop, 
                    which was located near his counting house in <span class="placeName-building-BILLITERST">Billiter Street</span> 
                    (see <a href="/notes/london_city_note" target="_self">City of London</a>). However, the Red Books 
                    retain no indications of their origin.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">From <span class="date-1826-1829">1826 to 1829</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> used the <span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span> 
                    for fair copying his writings, apart from letters and presentation copies of single poems. Starting about <span class="date-1829-1830">1829–30</span>, 
                    he put aside the <span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span> for larger, ledger‐like, half‐calf notebooks, some of which he dedicated solely to rough draft, 
                    and others solely to fair copy. For a few years after <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, however, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> exploited left‐over blank spaces 
                    in the <span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span> to rough‐draft poetry and prose—text that, in some cases, runs upside down and in an opposite direction to the earlier writing. 
                    Such treatment suggests that, by this time for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, the <span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span> had ceased hold the importance of “his works as he calls them”, in <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs phrase. 
                    She attributed this term <i>works</i> to <span class="persName-JR">John</span> in a <a href="/apparatuses/mr_to_jjr_1829-03-04_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-mr_to_jjr_1829-03-04">letter of <span class="date-1829-03-04">4 March 1829</span></span></a>, referring probably to the <span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span> in general, 
                    and perhaps specifically to <a href="/apparatuses/msii_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span></a>, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> inscribed as “Vol 1” on its front page 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 187). 
                    <span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span> is a handmade pamphlet, not a stationerʼs notebook, but its pages are cut and sewn to form the same dimensions as those of the <span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span>.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Judging by references to the <span class="title-book-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span> in family letters, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composed in these notebooks mainly at home, although their contents 
                    suggest that he may occasionally have carried some of them on family travels through <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>, <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span>, 
                    and <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>. Certainly, some contents of the <span class="title-book-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span> reflect the contemporaneous print culture of travel, 
                    such as his small anthology of topographical verse, <a href="/notes/poetry_discriptive_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“Poetry Discriptive”</span></a>;

                    These descriptions match the <span class="title-book-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span> accurately enough, 
                    although <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> may have meant  
                    <a href="/apparatuses/msv_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span></a>, which is a small half‐calf notebook that

               <div class="p">The term <span class="title-book-JRREDBOOK"><i>Red Book</i></span> stuck throughout <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs life. As late as <span class="date-1891">1891</span>, 
                    <a href="/notes/collingwood_w_g_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span></a> employed the term in

                    Describing <span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span> as a “ruled note‐book, bound in
                    red leather,” roughly 6 by 4 inches, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> goes on to use the term <span class="title-book-JRREDBOOK"><i>Red Book</i></span> 
                    as a shorthand to designate <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> and <span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span> as
                    conforming with this description (<a href="/notes/bibliography#POEMS4D1891" target="_self"><i>Poems</i> [4<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>]</a>, 1:262;

               <div class="p">On <span class="date-1870-09-08">8 September 1870</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> remembered the term when docketing 
                    <a href="/apparatuses/msiv_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span></a> as
                    “Red book No. 1,” <a href="/apparatuses/msiii_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a> as 
                    “Red book No. 2,” and <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a> as 
                    “Red book No. 3.” What prodded his selection and arrangement of these three of the seven <span class="title-book-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span> is unrecorded,
                    but there are clues to his motives. On <span class="date-1870-08-09">9 August</span>, he had visited <a href="/notes/herne_hill_note" target="_self"><span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span></a>,
                    where he “put all in order”, confiding to his diary that he “worked once more in that old house, going through the room where
                    I lay in the morning looking at my first watercolour painting”, and one wonders whether he found his juvenilia there, or whether the old
                    associations prompted him to unearth the <span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span> on return to <span class="placeName-DENMARKHL">Denmark Hill</span>. The diary entry for <span class="date-1870-09-08">8 September</span> remarks only on the bad weather, but, on the
                    following Sunday (<span class="date-1870-09-11">11 September</span>), <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> looks back on a depressing week (“for many a year” not one “so
                    miserable”), during which he “put much into order” and “read old poems of <span class="date-1848">1848</span>”:
                    “I have gained something in  <span class="date-1848-1870">these twenty‐two years</span>”, he decided

               <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs reasons are also obscure for having chosen these particular <span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span> to number, and for numbering them in this order. 
                    Curiously, he numbered them in reverse chronological order. “No. 1,” <a href="/apparatuses/msiv_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span></a>, 
                    is plainly dated <span class="date-1828">1828</span> in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs own boyhood hand; “No. 2,” 
                    <a href="/apparatuses/msiii_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a>, contains dates in his and his 
                    <span class="persName-MR">his mother</span>ʼs hands ranging from <span class="date-1826">1826</span> to <span class="date-1829">1829</span>; and “No. 3”, 
                    <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>, is dated <span class="date-1826-1827">1826–27</span> 
                    in his <span class="persName-MR">mother</span>ʼs hand (see <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus#DATE" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span>: Date</a>,

                    Perhaps he gave first place to <span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span> because its chief work is the botanical poem, “on the universe”, 
                    <a href="/apparatuses/eudosia_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">“Eudosia”</span></a>, 
                    for which had two possible reasons in <span class="date-1870">1870</span> to assign priority: his preference at this time to emphasize his boyhood talents for natural history; and obscure symbolic 
                    connections with <span class="persName-RLT">Rose La Touche (<span class="date-1848-1875">1848–75</span>)</span>.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">In <span class="date-1869">1869</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had mined <a href="/apparatuses/msiii_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a> 
                    for the boyhood poem <a href="/apparatuses/glenfarg_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRGLENFARG">“Glenfarg” and “Glen of Glenfarg” (“Papa how pretty those icicles are”</span></a>, 
                    which he reprinted in <span class="title-book-"><i>The Queen of the Air</i></span> as an illustration of his “birthright” of “art‐gift” 
                    that came to him “by Athenaʼs will, from the air of English country villages, and Scottish hills” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self">Ruskin, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 19:396–97, and see 283). 
                    In <span class="date-1869-09">September 1869</span>, <span class="persName-RLT">Rose</span> sent him a cryptic message, 
                    by returning her copy of the book, enclosing only a weed and a rose leaf between its pages. An accidental face‐to‐face meeting between <span class="persName-RLT">Rose</span> 
                    and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in <span class="date-1870-01">January 1870</span> only deepened the enigma and tension of their relations, 
                    and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> began compiling notes for a book that would become his own contribution to the “language of the flowers”, 
                    <span class="title-book-JRPROSERPINA"><i>Proserpina</i></span>. Their conflicted and rebarbative exchange continued throughout the year; however, a letter from <span class="persName-RLT">Rose</span> 
                    gave <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> hope, and in <span class="date-1870-09">September 1870</span>, when he annotated the <span class="title-book-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span>, he sought counsel to prepare a statement 
                    defining his legal, moral, and sexual status regarding his marriage—a document that would later precipitate disastrous commentary from his former wife, nee
                    <span class="persName-ECG">Effie Chalmers Gray</span> (<span class="date-1828-1897">1828–97</span>), now Effie Millais (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RUSKINLATERYEARS" target="_self"><span class="persName-THILTON">Hilton</span>, <i>John Ruskin: The Later Years</i></a>, 171–73, 179). 
                    Perhaps, at this crisis, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> found some sort of consolation in 
                    <a href="/apparatuses/eudosia_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">“Eudosia”</span></a>, which, as he would later summarize the poem

                    perhaps they related to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs marriage to <span class="persName-ECG">Effie</span> in that year, which also happened to be the year
