                    she was thus “occupied” with “other peopleʼs good instead of her own”, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> writes, from “the age of fifteen to seventy‐two”

                    the elder Ruskins—who were <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs parents and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs aunt and uncle—were living in <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>, 
                    not <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span>, in the house known as <span class="placeName-building-BOWERSWELL">Bowerswell</span>. <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> connects these facts with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs implication in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span> 
                    that <span class="persName-ASB">Anne</span> was his fatherʼs nurse before she was his, and concludes that the girl must have helped

                    and the disease kept him confined at <span class="placeName-building-BOWERSWELL">Bowerswell</span> until <span class="date-1814-07">July 1814</span> (<a href="/notes/bibliography#SCOTTISHHERITAGE" target="_self"><span class="title-book-SCOTTISHHERITAGE"><i>Ruskinʼs Scottish Heritage</i></span></a>, 157, 246 n. 23; and see

                    , 64, 66–67). In the ensuing months, 
                    she would have been stretched between her regular housekeeping duties and nursing <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, so it makes sense 
                    that a girl would have been hired to help in the house. The fifteen‐year‐old <span class="persName-ASB">Anne</span> presumably was inexperienced, 
                    not yet the servant who, according to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs testimonial, “was never quite in her glory unless some of us were ill”

                    To reduce expenses, <span class="persName-CR">Catherine</span> had pressed her husband to move from <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span> to the country, 
                    where household management could be confined to “Meggy [i.e., <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>] my self and one servant”

They had already lived a year in the “retired” 
                    but “shabby” coastal town of <span class="placeName-DYSART">Dysart</span> before moving to <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> to be near the household of their daughter, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs sister,

                    following their marriage, when living at their <span class="placeName-building-HUNTERST">Hunter Street</span> house in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>. <span class="persName-JR">John</span> was at this time a newborn 
                    (<span class="title-letter-mr_to_jjr_1819-03-26">26 March 1819</span>, in <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 92, 94 n. 6). But if <span class="persName-ASB">Anne</span> had been present in the background over the past five years, 
                    she was to some extent privy to the most dramatic events of her employersʼ lives. <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> had been betrothed since <span class="date-1809">1809</span>, 
                    and the crisis of <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs near‐lethal illness appears to have deepened their commitment, but now their union faced opposition by <span class="persName-JTR">John Thomas</span>. 
                    <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> was convinced that the tension would bring about <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs death (see <span class="title-letter-mcc_to_jjr_1814-07-12">Margaret Cock to John James Ruskin, 12 July 1814</span>;

                    Unexpectedly, in <span class="date-1815-06">June 1815</span>, <span class="persName-JTR">John Thomas</span> descended into madness. His sonʼs emotions were divided between apprehension for his parents and relief for himself and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>. 
                    Writing to his mother, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> rejected recourse to a “public asylum” where his father would be subjected to “Surrounding Horrors”, 
                    while recognizing that even “the strictest confinement” at home risked the “safety” and “health of the rest of the family”. Writing to <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>, 
                    he expressed compassion for his fatherʼs “frailties” but he could not resist interpreting his fatherʼs madness to their advantage 
                    as having rendered his father “in a manner dead to all of us”, exonerating the family from “a place in his affections”, and putting their 
                    “actions” beyond a hold even on <span class="persName-JTR">John Thomas</span>ʼs “least interest” much less his control. <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> also fretted over how public exposure “may injure me in business” 
                    (<span class="title-letter-jjr_to_cr_1815-06-30">John James to Catherine Ruskin, 30 June 1815</span>; and

                    As it turned out, release came by way of further calamity: in <span class="date-1817-10">October 1817</span>, <span class="persName-CR">Catherine Ruskin</span> died suddenly, 
                    followed shortly by <span class="persName-JTR">John Thomas</span>ʼs bloody suicide. At the time, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> was already in mourning for her own mother, 
                    <span class="persName-MCC">Margaret Cock</span> of <span class="placeName-CROYDON">Croydon</span>. Throughout all this, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> was struggling to launch a new wine importing business in partnership with 
                    <span class="persName-PD">Pedro Domecq</span> and <span class="persName-HT">Henry Telford</span>, for his fateful journey north in <span class="date-1813">1813</span> had been prompted by his flight from the declining fortunes 
                    of his previous employer, Gordon, Murphy, & Company (see the correspondence, <span class="date-1812-1817">1812–17</span>, in <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 53–88;

               <div class="p">As a young servant at <span class="placeName-building-BOWERSWELL">Bowerswell</span>, <span class="persName-ASB">Anne</span> shared the womenʼs vantage on these events, which helps to explain a degree of intimacy 
                    between her and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>. One can only speculate, however, about the causes that underlay a prickliness in their relationship, 
                    which is treated as comedy in reminiscences by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and by <span class="persName-GBURNEJONES">Georgiana Burne‐Jones</span>, but with a strong suggestion 
                    that <span class="persName-ASB">Anne</span> was fiercely loyal to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> and <span class="persName-JR">John</span> to the detriment of civility to <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> and “a want of deference” toward her mistress that,
                    as <span class="persName-GBURNEJONES">Burne‐Jones</span> put it, “was certainly not the growth of the moment”

                    about how <span class="persName-ASB">Anne</span> chose to manage her power by virtue of her presence at events that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> presumably did not want divulged to <span class="persName-JR">John</span>—at
