            <span class="head-section">Annuals</span>
            
            <div class="p">Literary annuals were anthologies of verse, short fiction and essays, along with engraved images, which were marketed to serve as gifts and tokens of friendship. 
                        In <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>, the annuals first emerged 
                     in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>, based primarily on a German model of the form, but also incorporating features of native precursors 
                    such as the almanac, album, and the <span class="date-1700-1799">eighteenth-century</span> &#x201C;pocket book&#x201D; used for notes and engagements.
                    Supported by innovations in mass reproduction of images and cheapened production of specialty bindings, the annuals contributed significantly to the visual culture 
                    of early Victorian <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>.</div>
            
            
            <div class="p">Most annuals presented text and image to some extent ekphrastically, typically using a Romantic&#x2010;era aesthetic 
                    of a shared &#x201C;poetic&#x201D; emotion uniting the Sister Arts 
                    (see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/friendships_offering_note.php#POETRYOFSISTERARTS");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering:</i> </span>: The Poetry of the Sister Arts</a>). 
                    Ekphrastic projects originated with the volume editor, who commissioned writers 
                    to respond to an engraving, rather than engaging artists to illustrate existing tales or verse, just as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composed his poem 
                    <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span></a> in response to an engraved view 
                        of the city that the editor, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/pringle_thomas_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-TP">Thomas Pringle</span></a> (<span class="date-1789-1835">1789&#x2013;1834</span>), already had in hand. By the time <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> began publishing his poetry in the annuals 
                        in the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>, they were a widely popular component of middle&#x2010;class visual and print culture, in which the Ruskin family already participated as consumers.</div>
            
            
            <div class="p">As tokens of endearment to be exchanged between lovers, friends, or family members, annuals were published toward the end of a given year, in late October or November, 
                    in time for the holiday season of Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s. Their titles therefore named the year following that of their actual publication. 
                    For example, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s first appearance in an annual was in the volume &#x201C;for&#x201D; <span class="date-1835">1835</span>, entitled 
                    <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath: A Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present for MDCCCXXXV</i></span></a>, 
                    but copy was sent to the printer as early as <span class="date-1834-08">August 1834</span> (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#VIGNEPRINGLE");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-RV">Vigne</span>, <span class="title-book-VIGNEPRINGLE"><i>Thomas Pringle</i></span></a>, 244), 
                    in order to be available for purchase no later than <span class="date-1834-11-1834-12">November or December</span>.</div>
            
            
            <div class="p">Because the Ruskins were Scots, they celebrated New Year&#x02BC;s rather than Christmas, 
                        and the family tradition included <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s presentation of a <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/new_years_poems_note.php");?>" target="_self">New Year&#x02BC;s poem</a> addressed to his father 
                    from almost the earliest time when he could manage a pencil. 
                    There appears no foundation for regarding this family tradition as influenced by the annuals: <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s holiday poems long preceded his publications in the annuals, as a feature of the earliest juvenilia, 
                        and he continued composing personalized New Year&#x02BC;s odes for the family independently of the poems published with the signature <span class="persName-pen_name-JR">&#x201C;J.R.&#x201D;</span> for public consumption. One can imagine, however, that the family cheer occasioned by <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s annual recitation of a New Year&#x02BC;s ode at the dinner table 
                        was augmented by pride in his contribution to the <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1830">&#x201C;Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present&#x201D;</span> of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>, which was being exchanged in that season among thousands.</div>

               <div class="p">The first British annual was <span class="title-annual-FORGETMENOT"><i>Forget Me Not</i></span>, published by the firm of Ackermann with the date <span class="date-1823">1823</span> for the holiday season of <span class="date-1822-11-1823-02">1822&#x2013;23</span>. 
                        As a publisher, <span class="persName-RAP">Rudolf Ackermann</span> (<span class="date-1764-1834">1764&#x2013;1834</span>) was known primarily for his high quality, extravagant topographical books, 
                        illustrated by brightly colored aquatints. For the <span class="title-annual-FORGETMENOT"><i>Forget Me Not</i></span>, <span class="persName-RAP">Ackermann</span> hit upon a successful blend 
                        of polite and sentimental verse, tales, and engraved illustration aimed at middle&#x2010; and upper&#x2010;class consumers, especially women, 
                        who already formed the primary audience for the Ackermann firm&#x02BC;s in&#x2010;house magazine, 
                        the <span class="title-periodical-REPOSITORYOFARTS"><i>Repository of Arts</i></span> (<span class="date-1809-1828">1809&#x2013;28</span>). 
                        The magazine&#x02BC;s editor, <span class="persName-FS">Frederic Shoberl</span> (<span class="date-1775-1853">1775&#x2013;1853</span>), did double duty as the editor of the <span class="title-annual-FORGETMENOT"><i>Forget Me Not</i></span> 
                        (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-JFORD">Ford</span>, <span class="title-book-FORDACKERMANN"><i>Ackermann</i></span></a>, 70, 64&#x2013;65, 80&#x2013;83).</div>
               
               
               <div id="PRCURSORS" class="sub-subsection">
                  <span class="head-sub-subsection">Precursors of the Annuals</span>
                  
                  <div class="p">According to <span class="persName-AR">Anne Renier</span>, <span class="persName-RAP">Ackermann</span> based his creation on a combination of two models, the German <i>Taschenbuch</i>, and the British <i>pocket book</i>. 
                        The former kind of publication modeled the literary content and illustration for which the British annuals became known, 
                        whereas the latter presented tables of useful information along with blank or illustrated pages for the owner&#x02BC;s memoranda 
                        (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#RENIERFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-AR">Renier</span>, <span class="title-book-RENIERFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span></a>, 5&#x2013;6). 
                        To this ancestry of the annual, <span class="persName-KDH">Katherine Harris</span> adds the printed traditions of the emblem book and the almanac, 
                        as well as the homemade fashions of the lady&#x02BC;s album and the scrapbook, which were compiled by hand for personal collecting, 
                        although consumers could obtain a pre&#x2010;manufactured cover with blank pages 
                        (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#HARRISBORROWING");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-KDH">Harris</span>, <span class="title-essay-HARRISBORROWING">&#x201C;Borrowing, Altering, and Perfecting the Literary Annual Form&#x201D;</span></a>).
                        (Some confusion of terms arises from the similarity between the German <i>Taschenbuch</i> 
                        and the English <i>pocket book</i>, both terms referring to the publications&#x02BC; portable size, 
                        but the German form was literary, whereas the English <span class="date-1700-1799">eighteenth&#x2010;century</span> pocket book was akin to the almanac and diary.)
                    </div>
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="date-1700-1799">Eighteenth&#x2010;century</span> pocket books resembled almanacs by including reference information, especially tables of facts that were deemed appropriate 
                        to fashionable readers, such as lists of the members of the British royalty, the crowned heads of <span class="geogName-EUROPE">Europe</span>, and names of other dignitaries. 
                        This convention appealed to <span class="persName-RAP">Ackermann</span>, since he marketed his books and art supplies primarily to leisured and wealthy clientele, 
                        and accordingly the first <span class="title-annual-FORGETMENOT"><i>Forget Me Not</i></span> included a <span class="title-catalogue-HOUSESOFBRITAINFORGETMENOT1823">&#x201C;General Summary of Houses, Families, and Persons in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Great Britain</span>, in <span class="date-1821">1821</span>&#x201D;</span>, along with tables of other demographic 
                        information about <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>, <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span>, and <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>. 
                        This first British annual also reflected the original use of the pocket book as an engagement calendar,   
                        being ornamented with a series of emblematic treatments of the twelve months, reproduced from copper engravings

                    </div>
                  
                  <div class="p">After the first <span class="title-annual-FORGETMENOT"><i>Forget Me Not</i></span>, the Ackermann firm dropped the almanac features; and according to <span class="persName-KDH">Katherine Harris</span>, by <span class="date-1825">1825</span> 
                        all British annuals had abandoned almanac&#x2010; and diary&#x2010;like elements in favor of strictly literary and pictorial contents 
                        (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#HARRISBORROWING");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-KDH">Harris</span>, <span class="title-essay-HARRISBORROWING">&#x201C;Borrowing, Altering, and Perfecting the Literary Annual Form&#x201D;</span></a>, 7). 
                        Along the way to this stabilization of annuals in shared elements of early Victorian ekphrastic print culture, what might now be viewed as transitional publications eshibited devices of engaging a Romantic&#x2010;era reader. 
                        As <span class="persName-SLODGE">Sara Lodge</span> has shown, pocket books published shortly prior 
                        to Ackermann&#x02BC;s <span class="title-annual-FORGETMENOT"><i>Forget Me Not</i></span> 
                        combined features of the diary and almanac with the literary and artistic anthology, with the aim 
                        of inviting reader response. In the words of <span class="persName-JHLH">Leigh Hunt</span> prefacing the 
                        <span class="title-annual-"><i>Literary Pocket&#x2010;Book; or, Companion for the Lover of Nature and Art</i></span> 
                        (<span class="date-1818-1822">1818&#x2013;22</span>), 
                        the reader was encouraged to mark each passing day with a &#x201C;little homage . . . to a favourite writer or artist&#x201D; and to &#x201C;discuss the influence he has had upon taste and opinion&#x201D;. 
                        The result would be the owner&#x02BC;s own &#x201C;Calendar of Nature&#x201D; in place of a calendar of royalty 
                        (quoted in <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#LODGEROMANTICRELIQUARIES");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-SLODGE">Lodge</span>, <span class="title-essay-">&#x201C;Romantic Reliquaries&#x201D;</span></a>, 25;

                                into a permanent keepsake. The publisher commissioned sophisticated, historical&#x2010; or literary&#x2010;themed copper engravings to adorn a print item worth preserving, 
                                and offered a range of bindings, from functional to elegant. Some owners dedicated the diary pages to memoranda more lasting than notes about engagements, 
                                and decorated their copies with handmade coverings, presumably to serve as personal gifts

                                Prior to <span class="persName-SR">Samuel Rogers</span> realizing his travelogue poem <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> in its influential form as an illustrated gift book, 
                                quotations from the poem were used to head the memorandum pages of a pocket book, along with engraved vignettes by <span class="persName-TSP">Thomas Stothard</span>

                  <div class="p">As the literary annuals abandoned the features of the pocket book that invited readers to leave material traces of their creative engagement, 
                                and became what <span class="persName-KDH">Harris</span> summarizes as a &#x201C;more marketable and completely prefabricated book of printed memories&#x201D;

                                The annuals took over the publication schedule of pocket books, requiring release on the market in late October or November 
                                in time for purchase as Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s presents. Also like pocket books and almanacs, 
                                annuals lost perceived value as gifts after the beginning of the New Year; however, unlike their precursors, annuals were meant to be kept as permanent remembrances.

                  <div class="p">One great significance of <span class="persName-AWEDITOR">Watts&#x02BC;s</span> <span class="title-annual-LITERARYSOUVENIR"><i>Literary Souvenir</i></span> lay in the introduction of steel engraving to the annuals&#x2014;that is, 
                       intaglio printing from a steel plate. Typically, the steel plate was covered with an etching ground, 
                       which was engraved by an etching needle in preparation for etching by acid, and then the image was further worked using a burin. 
                       Because steel is much harder than copper, its durability increased the viability of print runs to the thousands of impressions, 
                       compared to the few hundreds of impressions possible from a copper plate, 
                       which rapidly wore thin from the abrasion of wiping

                       While copper rapidly yields lighter and dimmer impressions, its more pliable surface is easier to engrave than stubborn steel; 
                       and therefore innovations were required to make steel practicable for this use, 
                       such as softening the steel for engraving and then hardening the plate. 
                       With these developments, the art grew rapidly in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>

                  <div class="p">Another feature of the annuals that set apart these publications as especially desirable consumer items was their rich bindings. 
                        The first annuals were covered with glazed paper boards that were printed with a design framing the title, 
                        and the volumes were protected by a slipcase of the same materials and printed design. By the 
                        <span class="date-1827-1829">final quarter of the 1820s</span>, these paper and cloth bindings were being outdone by silk, 
                        which was regarded as not only a luxurious and feminine material but also as supplanting the need for a slipcase. 
                        In <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, however, all this showiness was trumped by

                        which announced itself as newly acquired by the firm of Smith, Elder by boasting embossed leather boards.

                        were called <i>arabesque</i>, incorporating floral and other pictorial elements. The arabesque pattern 
                        was distinguished from <i>cathedral</i> patterns, which were associated with devotional publications. 
                        A cheaper alternative means of embossing was to employ 
                        <i>engine&#x2010;turned</i> designs, resulting in the fine&#x2010;lined ornaments developed originally for bank notes. 
                        But by the <span class="date-1827-1829">final quarter of the 1820s</span>, arabesque designs could as well be produced by machine 
                        (pp. 10&#x2013;13, and see 7&#x2013;14). 
                        Indeed, the flamboyance, yet relative inexpensiveness, of these bindings, which anticipate the ornate fancifulness 
                        achieved in the heyday of Victorian bookbinding, 
                        the <span class="date-1860-1879">1860s&#x2013;70s</span>, indicates how suddenly factory modes of production had transformed a cottage industry

                            Within five years of publication of the first British annual, this presumed middle&#x2010;class female audience begins to splinter with the emergence of specialized annuals for children

                            steered the family consumption of annuals toward these more constrained and targeted publications. Despite <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s initial qualms,

                            as passive and specular to be relished voyeuristically by the consumer

                            For some publishers, the high cost of production, often combined with an expensive pursuit of celebrated contributors, became unsustainable by the <span class="date-1840-1849">1840s</span>, 
                            and the annuals died out altogether by the <span class="date-1860-1869">1860s</span>

                            After the reign of the annuals had passed, the later Victorians found it easy to mock the often run&#x2010;of&#x2010;the&#x2010;mill contents of these publications, 
                            which alternated between simpering sentiment and melodramatic horror, but the grown&#x2010;up Victorians could not so easily escape the influence of the annuals&#x02BC; images 
                            over their imagination in youth.

               <div class="p">It is striking that an eighteen&#x2010;year&#x2010;old youth, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s cousin, <span class="persName-CTR">Charles</span>, deemed it appropriate to present a younger boy, aged ten, with <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span> as a gift. 
                        It is even more surprising that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/richardson_bridget_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-BR">Aunt Bridget</span></a> made him a gift of <span class="title-annual-FORGETMENOT"><i>Forget Me Not</i></span> when he was only eight,

                        However, these gifts become less surprising in view of a study by <span class="persName-PRF">Paula R.

                        While findings based on a single collection must be considered tentative, the study gives sufficient grounds to question the assumption that annuals were most commonly purchased by men to present to women as a courtship gift; 
                        instead, &#x201C;literary annuals appear to have been purchased much more often as gifts between family members&#x201D;, since &#x201C;it is far more common to find inscriptions between siblings, or from parents to daughters, 
                        from aunts and uncles to nieces, and from husbands to wives&#x201D;. Thus, the presentation of an annual to <span class="persName-JR">John</span> by an aunt or cousin would not have been considered unusual; 
                        and while <span class="persName-PRF">Feldman</span> finds that apparently &#x201C;it was <i>not</i> permissible for a female to have given an adult male one of these volumes&#x201D;, 
                        the sampling did reveal instances of annual giving between males and (more commonly) between females (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#FELDMANINSCRIPTIONS");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-PRF">Feldman</span>, <span class="title-essay-FELDMANINSCRIPTIONS">&#x201C;Women, Literary Annuals, and the Evidence of Inscriptions&#x201D;</span></a>, 58, 57).</div>

                        Ackermann&#x02BC;s annual had now caught up with the technology of steel engraving for book illustration, 
                        which proved key to the success of all the annuals. As compared with softer copper, which soon lost its edge in repeated impressions, 
                        steel engraving made possible the mass production of images, and helped to satisfy the craving for pervasive, but affordable visual culture by the early&#x2010;Victorian middle class. 
                        These developments coincided with <span class="persName-AE">Alexander Elder</span>&#x02BC;s ambitions for <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>.

                        When transferring features of the <i>Taschenbuch</i> from his native <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-RAP">Ackermann</span> emphasized the popular Romantic Gothic and sentimental elements. 
                        As <span class="persName-KDH">Harris</span> has discovered, <span class="persName-RAP">Ackermann</span> modeled the <span class="title-annual-FORGETMENOT"><i>Forget Me Not</i></span> 
                        more closely than he acknowledged on a particular <i>Taschenbuch</i>, the <span class="title-annual-VERGISSMEINNICHT"><i>Vergissmeinnicht</i></span>, edited by 
                        <span class="persName-HC">Heinrich Clauren</span> (<span class="persName-KHEUN">Karl Heun</span>, <span class="date-1771-1854">1771&#x2013;1854</span>),

                        Based on the proven success of these formulas, the popularity of these first volumes of <span class="title-annual-FORGETMENOT"><i>Forget Me Not</i></span> proved so overwhelming  
                        that the Ackermann firm diverted a major share of its resources into the books&#x02BC; production, 
                        consequently relinquishing experiments with lithography, 
                        a new method of reproducting images that the firm had recently helped to introduce to <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>. 
                        <span class="persName-RAP">Ackermann</span> turned over the opportunity to develop the new technology to <span class="persName-CH">Charles Hullmandel</span> (see

                        <span class="persName-RAP">Ackermann</span>&#x02BC;s success and increased production immediately inspired other publishers to enter the field with their own annual. The first imitator was

                        (<span class="date-1828-1857">1828&#x2013;57</span>). 
                        From the annual&#x02BC;s beginnings in <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, <span class="persName-CTH">Heath</span> showcased engravings after <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>, 
                        and in the same year <span class="persName-CTH">Heath</span> also published

                        for which the engraver commissioned and purchased 120 watercolors by <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>.

                        <span class="persName-FMR">Frederic Mansel Reynolds</span> (ca. <span class="date-1800-1850">1800&#x2013;1850</span>), 
                        journeyed personally to the <span class="geogName-SCOTTISHBORDERS">Scottish borders</span> and the <span class="geogName-LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</span>, 
                        aiming to solicit contributions from the celebrated poets associated with these landscapes, <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>,

               <div class="p">The enticement of this class of annuals for the Ruskin family can be measured by an episode in <span class="date-1832">1832</span>, when the idea was floated 
                            of producing a new deluxe edition of <span class="title-collected_poems-THEQUEENSWAKE"><i>The Queen&#x02BC;s Wake</i></span> (<span class="date-1813-1819">1813&#x2013;19</span>) as a charitable scheme supporting the Scottish poet,

                            <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> urged that the gift book &#x201C;should be a work something like <span class="title-annual-KEEPSAKE">The Keepsake</span>&#x201D; with landscape illustrations by

                            &#x201C;so as to make it a drawing&#x2010;room book&#x201D;.  
                        To this effort, <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> subscribed generously 
                        with a donation of &#x00A3;20, pleading for the honor of being listed as the first subscriber

                        It is significant that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> sent the donation on <span class="date-1832-02-08">8 February 1832</span>, 
                        his son&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1832-02-08">thirteenth birthday</span>, when the boy is believed to have received another 
                        deluxe edition of an established modern landscape classic‒the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> edition of 
                        <i>Italy</i> by <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/rogers_samuel_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-SR">Samuel Rogers</span> (<span class="date-1763-1855">1763&#x2013;1855</span>)</a>,

                            Had it appeared, the book might have taken a place in the Ruskin family mythology alongside <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="placeName-ITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, 
                            since both <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> and <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> served personally as mentors to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            in <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, when the youth published his own topographical poem to the accompaniment of a steel&#x2010;engraved landscape plate,

                        offers of cash that were so princely that he fatally strained relations with 
                        his publishers, the firms of Robert Jennings and of 
                        Hurst, Chance. These ambitious schemes suggest that <span class="persName-CTH">Heath</span> was interested less in promoting 
                        landscape art per se than in promoting and rewarding himself, rather than 
                        publishers, with the proceeds of his talent for steel engraving; however, 
                        <span class="persName-BH">Basil Hunnisett</span> may be correct to credit <span class="persName-CTH">Heath</span> 
                        at least incidentally with the development of the 
                        landscape annual as a class (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-book-HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED"><i>Steel&#x2010;Engraved Book Illustration in England</i></span></a>,

                        The landscape annuals produced in association with <span class="persName-CTH">Heath&#x02BC;s</span> large workshop
                        included the <span class="title-artwork-RJLANDSCAPEANNUAL"> <i>Landscape Annual</i></span> (later retitled <span class="title-artwork-RJLANDSCAPEANNUAL"> <i>Jennings&#x02BC; Landscape Annual</i></span>)

                        imitators, such as the <span class="title-annual-CONTINENTALANNUAL1832"><i>Continental Annual and Romantic Cabinet</i></span>, published in <span class="date-1832">1832</span> by 
                        Smith, Elder, and illustrated by another favorite artist of the Ruskins&#x02BC;,

               <div class="p">At the same time, viewed in a longer perspective, 
                        the landscape annual can be situated in the broader context of travel writing and illustration, 
                        in which the steel&#x2010;engraved landscape annuals formed a stage between the British copper&#x2010;engraved topographical and antiquarian magazines 
                        published <span class="date-1770-1819">between the last three decades of the eighteenth century and first two decades of the nineteenth</span>, 
                        and the magazines promoting the etching revival <span class="date-1870-1899">in the final three decades of the nineteenth century</span> 
                        (see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#ROBERTSBRITISHARTPERIODICALS");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-HEROBERTS">Roberts</span>, <span class="title-essay-ROBERTSBRITISHARTPERIODICALS">&#x201C;British Art Periodicals of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries&#x201D;</span></a>, 3&#x2013;4). 
                        In this context, for the Ruskins, the landscape annuals belong to the category of topographical 
                        poetry and prose, such as <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> by 
                        <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/rogers_samuel_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-SR">Samuel Rogers</span> (<span class="date-1763-1855">1763&#x2013;1855</span>)</a>; 
                        pictorial travelogues, with or without letterpress, such as 
                        <span class="title-artwork-PROUTSKETCHES"><i>Facsimiles of Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany</i></span> by 
                        <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/prout_samuel_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-SP">Samuel Prout</span> (<span class="date-1783-1852">1783&#x2013;1852</span>)</a>;

                        Topographical poetry, travel narrative, and landscape illustration were often included in annuals that were not specifically landscape annuals; 
                        an example is <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s own first contribution to an annual, the poem 
                        <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span></a>, published in <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>. 
                        Unlike the illustrated literary annuals, however, which typically 
                        anthologized a miscellany of verse and prose along with illustrations of both landscapes and figures, which were contributed by a variety of writers and artists, 
                        the landscape annuals featured a single artist paired with a single writer of the letterpress. Although subordinated to the artist, 
                        the writer for a landscape annual could, like <span class="persName-LR">Leitch Ritchie</span>, 
                        see himself as contributing &#x201C;<i>bona fide</i> sketches of his own&#x201D;

                        was the collected edition of poetry or prose by a British author, gathered into uniformly bound volumes, which were solidly but inexpensively produced. 
                        The Ruskins had first&#x2010;hand experience of these editions in the <span class="title-series-SCOTTMAGNUM">Magnum Opus</span> of <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>, 
                        which started the trend, and they witnessed the failed attempt by

                        to complete such an edition of the <span class="title-book-HOGGALTRIVETALES"><i>Altrive Tales</i></span>. In order to economize, these editions featured only a few illustrations per volume, 
                        but publishers made up the deficiency by selling portfolios of prints, which collectors could bind either separately or along with the uniform edition in question
