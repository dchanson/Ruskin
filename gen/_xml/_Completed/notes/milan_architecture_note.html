                    imagination is captured by the vertical thrust of the Gothic architecture complemented by the mountain heights beyond the city. In contrast, a planned but apparently unexecuted section for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>, 
                    <span class="title-composite-JRCORSOMILANCOMP">“The Corso of Milan”</span>, presumably would have responded to the horizontal expanse of neoclassical and Napoleonic‐era monuments in the city

                  <div class="p">During the Enlightenment, under the administration of the Hapsburgs, urban planning in neoclassical style for <span class="placeName-MILAN">Milan</span> 
                    was overseen by the architect <span class="persName-GPIERMARINI">Giuseppe Piermarini</span> (<span class="date-1734-1808">1734–1808</span>). The Ruskins 
                    visited his most famous building, the <span class="placeName-building-TEATROALLASCALA">Teatro alla Scala</span> (<span class="date-1776-1778">1776–78</span>), 
                    although they were unable to attend a performance, and they would have encountered other structures associated with <span class="persName-GPIERMARINI">Piermarini</span>ʼs neoclassical renovations 
                    throughout the city. For example, the <i>corso</i> that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> planned to write about and that <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> mentions in her diary was most likely 
                    the <span class="placeName-building-PORTAVENEZIA">Corso di Porta Orientale</span> (also known as the <span class="placeName-building-PORTAVENEZIA">Porta Venezia</span>), 
                    which underwent modernization between <span class="date-1827">1827</span> and the year of the Ruskinsʼ visit, <span class="date-1833">1833</span>. As described in an <span class="date-1836">1836</span> Milanese guidebook for English tourists, 
                    the corso “proceeds from the central square of the town . . . almost in a straight line”, presenting “several striking points of view, and exhibit[ing] an uninterrupted succession 
                    of fine houses, handsome palaces, and well planted gardens”, until reaching the “ramparts majestically opening on each side of the gate”

                    features a pair of cubical structures that, like the <span class="placeName-building-BRANDEBURGGATE">Brandeburg Gate</span> in <span class="placeName-BERLIN">Berlin</span>,

                  <div class="p">By the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>, however, the Enlightenment Hapsburg project in <span class="placeName-MILAN">Milan</span> 
                    had been overlain by <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span>ʼs appropriation of the Enlightenment neoclassical program to impress the stamp of republican and imperial ideals 
                    on the principal cities of his Italian kingdom. This symbolism was often expressed using a columnar, Doric vocabulary associated with <span class="placeName-PAESTUM">Paestum</span>. 
                    The Ruskins appear to have sought out these Napoleonic monuments. <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> mentions a vast “amphitheatre” “built by <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span>“ 
                    to accommodate tens of thousands of spectators. She doubtless refers to the <span class="placeName-FOROBONAPARTE">Foro Bonaparte</span> (<span class="date-1801-1806">1801–6</span>), 
                    which <span class="persName-GAANTOLINI">Giovanni Antonio Antolini</span> (<span class="date-1756-1841">1756–1841</span>) planned as a spectacular entrance to the city

                    who reduced the scale of <span class="persName-GAANTOLINI">Antolini</span>ʼs original plans (<span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>ʼs figure of 42,000 spectators 
                    hugely exaggerated the forumʼs capacity) (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFT48" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</span></a>, 46;

                  <div class="p">At the forumʼs entrance on the city side, the Ruskins also viewed the ceremonial arch commemorating <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span>ʼs victory at <span class="placeName-MARENGO">Marengo</span>, 
                    the <span class="placeName-building-ARCODELLAPACE">Arco delle Vittorie napoleoniche</span>, designed by <span class="persName-MLCAGNOLA">Luigi Cagnola</span> 
                    (<span class="date-1762-1833">1762–1833</span>). Begun in <span class="date-1807">1807</span>, the arch not only remained unfinished when the Ruskins visited, 
                    but was also in process of redefinition. As explained in <span class="title-book-MURRAYSHANDBOOKNORTHERNITALY1847"><span class="persName-JM">Murray</span>ʼs guide to northern Italy</span> 
                    (<span class="date-1847">1847</span>), the triumphal arch was meant to be decorated “with bas‐reliefs representing the events of <span class="date-1799-11-09-1815-06-18">Napoleonʼs wars</span>”; 
                    however, when the Kingdom of <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> fell and <span class="placeName-MILAN">Milan</span> returned to control by <span class="placeName-AUSTRIA">Austria</span>, 
                    the name of the monument “was changed to the Arch of Peace [the <span class="placeName-building-ARCODELLAPACE">Arco della Pace</span>], . . . and the sculptures underwent a transformation 
                    to make them represent the events which preceded the general peace”. An American traveler who viewed the arch in the same year as the Ruskins reported that “the structure was nearly 
                    completed”, but while the reliefs “which represent the <span class="date-1800-06-14">battle of <span class="placeName-MARENGO">Marengo</span></span> and the humiliating treaties 
                    which followed” were “allowed to remain unharmed”, the panels were “surmounted with others of equal execution, setting forth the <span class="date-1815-06-18">battle of <span class="placeName-WATERLOO">Waterloo</span></span> 
                    and the abdication of <span class="persName-NBE">Bonaparte</span>. The triumphal chariot, and bronze horses, which were to support the statue of <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span> 
                    upon the top” were planned to “be occupied by an allegorical figure representing Peace”

                    According to <span class="persName-FHASKELL">Francis Haskell</span>, <span class="persName-GBSOMMARIVA">Sommariva</span> as a collector 
                    “played a greater part than any other patron in <span class="placeName-EUROPE">Europe</span> in prolonging the classical art 
                    of the last half of the eighteenth century into the era of Romanticism”—and particularly sustaining the art “of the sentimental‐erotic world of the eighteenth century in <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span>, 
                    just before it collapsed with the ancient régime”. Guidebooks single out Italian neoclassical painters <span class="persName-AAPPIANI">Andrea Appiani</span> (<span class="date-1754-1817">1754–1817</span>) and 
                    <span class="persName-GGSERANGELI">Gioacchino Giuseppe Serangeli</span> (<span class="date-1768-1852">1768–1852</span>) and also Italian Romantic painters

                    “could hardly be more removed from that of the average English art lover of the day”, allowing “hardly any landscapes, 
                    and virtually no ‘troubadour’ or genre scenes” (although an Italian guidebook writer strove to enliven the interest of his British audience by dwelling 
                    on a picture based on <span class="persName-WSP">Shakespeare</span>ʼs <span class="title-drama-SHAKESPEAREROMEO"><i>Romeo and Juliet</i></span> by

                    and while he tempered this austerity with a taste for erotic and “lush classicism”, he reserved the more licentious works for his <span class="placeName-PARIS">Paris</span> residence, 
                    “while keeping his more orthodox, masculine, ‘neo‐classical’ works in his <span class="placeName-building-VILLACARLOTTA">Villa</span> on <span class="geogName-LAKECOMO">Lake Como</span>”
