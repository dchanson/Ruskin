               <div class="p">In <span class="date-1833">1833</span>, when the Ruskins visited the <span class="placeName-building-FRANKFURTNEWCEMETERY">New Cemetery</span> in <span class="placeName-FRANKFURT">Frankfurt am Main</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span> gained perhaps his first exposure to the new urban cemeteries that were starting to replace the traditional parish churchyard in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> and <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span> 
                    (see <a href="/witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii#ACCOUNTOCFRANCFURT" target="_self"><span class="title-bibliography_text-">List of Proposed Additional Contents for the “Account”</span></a>). 
                    Possibly, by that time, he may also have visited <span class="placeName-LIVERPOOL">Liverpool</span> with his family, where he could have viewed that cityʼs new <span class="placeName-building-STJAMESSCEMETERY">St. Jamesʼs Cemetery</span>, 
                    which opened in <span class="date-1829">1829</span>. Responding both to hygienic concerns, which had become pressing owing to rapid urban growth that led to overcrowded city burial places, and 
                    to the need for nondenominational alternatives to Anglican parish churchyards, the new cemeteries were operated by joint stock companies.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Architecturally, these cemeteries presented a significant focus for neoclassicism until that taste was displaced by Gothic Revival influences in <span class="date-1834-1867">mid‐century</span>. Entered via a massive gatehouse, 
                    often modeled on the Greek Doric propylaeum, the grounds were conceived as a classical <span class="placeName-ELYSIUM">Elysium</span>, inspired by the <span class="placeName-fictional-ARCADIA">Arcadian</span> landscape tradition in painting and estate gardening. 
                    Another classical model was the “city of the dead” or necropolis, drawn from <span class="placeName-">Etruscan</span> tomb complexes and (although quite different from the Etruscan model in origin and conception) Roman catacombs. 
                    Like <span class="persName-JN">John Nash</span>ʼs conception of <span class="placeName-building-REGENTSPARK">Regentʼs Park</span> in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, 
                    classical architectural style combined with the contemporary taste for the picturesque, which determined the serpentine layouts 
                    of walks, drives, and the botanically diverse plantings. The English gardening tradition melded with neoclassical monuments even in new cemeteries on the Continent. 
                    The hugely influential design combining these elements was the <span class="placeName-building-PERELACHAISE">Cimetière du Père‐Lachaise</span> in <span class="placeName-PARIS">Paris</span>, established in <span class="date-1804">1804</span>, 
                    and created by <span class="persName-ATBRONGNIART">Alexandre‐Théodore Brongniart</span> (<span class="date-1739-1813">1739–1813</span>) 
                    under the patronage of <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon Bonaparte</span>. (Apparently, the Ruskins visited <span class="placeName-building-PERELACHAISE">Père‐Lachaise</span> 
                    on their way home from the <a href="/notes/tour_of_1833_note" target="_self">Tour of 1833</a>, 
                    since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> planned to write about the cemetery in the <span class="title-composite-">Account of a Tour on the Continent</span>; see

               <div class="p">In <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>, cemetery architecture eventually came under the influence of <a href="/notes/loudon_j_c_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-JCL">John Claudius Loudon</span></a> (<span class="date-1783-1843">1783–1843</span>), 
                    who modified the combined <span class="placeName-fictional-ARCADIA">Arcadian</span> and picturesque tastes that had governed the garden cemetery, by enforcing a characteristically comprehensive plan 
                    that was hygienically practical for disposal of the dead yet also morally instructive for the living observer. <span class="persName-JCL">Loudon</span>ʼs treatise,
