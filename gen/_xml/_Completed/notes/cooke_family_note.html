               <div class="p">Family of English engravers and artists. Of German ancestry, the brothers <span class="persName-WBCOOKE">William Bernard</span> (<span class="date-1779-1855">1779–1855</span>) and <span class="persName-GCOOKE">George</span> (<span class="date-1781-1834">1781–1834</span>), 
                    were apprenticed to engravers in the late eighteenth century, when English engraving was undergoing stylistic and technical development 
                    along with British landscape painting and illustration. <span class="persName-WBCOOKE">William Bernard</span> was also an entrepreneur, 
                    who operated a print shop and gallery in <span class="placeName-building-SOHOSQUARE">Soho Square</span>, <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> (ca. <span class="date-1821-1830">1821–30</span>). The gallery exhibited English engraving and watercolor, 
                    using items not only from the Cooke shop but also on loan from collectors. <span class="persName-GCOOKE">George</span>, also drawing on the assistance of the brothersʼ studio, 
                    was extensively occupied by an aquatint project in botanical illustration, <span class="title-artwork-COOKEBOTANICAL"><i>The Botanical Cabinet</i></span> (<span class="date-1817-1833">1817–33</span>). 
                    A son of <span class="persName-GCOOKE">George</span> became the marine painter, <span class="persName-EWC">Edward William Cooke</span> (<span class="date-1811-1880">1811–80</span>); and 
                    a cousin of <span class="persName-EWC">Edward</span>, <span class="persName-WJC">William John Cooke</span>, became an engraver in steel, who contributed advancements in etching that medium 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MUNDAYCOOKE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JMUNDAY">Munday</span>, <span class="title-book-MUNDAYCOOKE"><i><span class="persName-EWC">Edward William Cooke</span></i></span></a>, 27, 32–33, 37–38).</div>
               
               <div class="p">The elder brothers oversaw an ambitious number of projects in their shop (<a href="/notes/biblography#MUNDAYCOOKE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JMUNDAY">Munday</span>, <span class="title-book-MUNDAYCOOKE"><i><span class="persName-EWC">Edward William Cooke</span></i></span></a>, 34, 39–42), 
                    but their most important joint project was <span class="title-artwork-"><i>Picturesque Views of the Southern Coast of England</i></span> (<span class="date-1814-1826">1814–26</span>), 
                    based chiefly on drawings by <span class="persName-JMWT">J. M. W. Turner</span>. Although the project was beset by delays, 
                    in the course of it <span class="persName-">Turner</span> learned to treat engraving as an expressive medium in which he could play a collaborative role. 
                    <span class="persName-WBCOOKE">W. B. Cooke</span> was also instrumental in furthering <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>ʼs contributions to steel engraving, by employing the mezzotint engraver, 
                    <span class="persName-TGL">Thomas Goff Lupton</span> (<span class="date-1792-1873">1791–1873</span>), with whom <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> had already collaborated, and who was making successful breakthroughs 
                    in the practical use of that stubborn but durable medium. For these first <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> engravings on steel, <span class="persName-WBCOOKE">Cooke</span> commissioned the series, 
                    <span class="title-artwork-COOKERIVERSOFENGLAND"><i>The Rivers of England</i></span> (<span class="date-1823-1827">1823–27</span>). This series was the occasion of the first serious falling‐out between <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> 
                    and the Cooke brothers, over the question of whether <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> would “touch” (make improvements to) plates based on drawings by another artist, 
                    <span class="persName-TGIRTIN">Thomas Girtin</span> (<span class="date-1775-1802">1775–1802</span>) (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#SHANESTURNERSRIVERS" target="_self"><span class="persName-ESHANES">Shanes</span>, <span class="title-book-SHANESTURNERSRIVERS"><i>Turnerʼs Rivers, Harbours and Coasts</i></span></a>, 5–12).</div>
