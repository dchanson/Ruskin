                    belongs to a larger <span class="date-1870-1900">fin de siècle</span> phenomenon in book collecting whereby collectors turned
                    their attention to modern (i.e., <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth‐century</span>) authors rather than
                    to incunabula and fine typography and illustration, which had preoccupied
                    collectors earlier in the century. Author societies, such as those dedicated to
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="persName-RB">Robert Browning</span>, and <span class="persName-PBS">Percy Shelley</span>,
                    organized study of every aspect of their authorsʼ lives and works; and
                    supporting this activity, industrious bibliographers, editors, publishers, and
                    booksellers produced reprints and editions of canonical modern authorsʼ
                    works, including juvenilia, along with enumerative or descriptive bibliographies
                    detailing the authorsʼ publications 
                    (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#CARTERTASTEANDTECHNIQUE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JC">Carter</span>, <span class="title-book-CARTERTASTEANDTECHNIQUE"><i>Taste and Technique in Book‐Collecting</i></span></a>, 22).

                  <div class="p">The aim was to
                        collect a run of an authorʼs publications that was complete, down to the
                        most minor and fugitive items, and that exhibited each item in its original
                        material condition. These goals led to collectorsʼ competitive search for
                        rare books (causing a rise in market prices). The juvenilia and youthful writing
                        of modern authors—what were called <i>early editions</i>—acquired a cachet owing to their extreme scarcity. This
                        goal of comprehensiveness in collecting was controversial, as collectors appeared to place
                        exaggerated value on an authorʼs minor works. Publishers were suspected of
                        encouraging an interest in juvenilia, since the desire could be met with
                        reprints of works that were out of copyright or appeared to be neglected. Yet, despite these competitive incentives and keenness for the hunt, another
                        significant motivation for collectorsʼ interest in youthful writing lay in a “sentiment”
                        strongly attached to these early editions in their original condition, and to juvenilia in particular. This sentiment likewise proved fraught and
                        controversial.

                  <div class="p">In historical accounts of the <span class="date-1880-06-20-1901-01-22">late‐Victorian</span> collecting of modern authors, 
                        the less savory, competitive motivations of collectors were foregrounded, 
                        because these motivations were blamed for creating opportunities for literary forgers. In the overheated rare book market of the last decades of the century, 
                        it was all too easy to fool buyers with spurious editions of lesser known works by prolific <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth‐century</span> authors. Most notoriously, 
                        <span class="persName-HBF">Henry Buxton Forman</span> (<span class="date-1842-1917">1842–1917</span>) hit upon the
                        idea—an idea aggressively pursued by <span class="persName-HBF">Forman</span>ʼs associate, 
                        <a href="/notes/wise_t_j_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-TJW">Thomas J. Wise</span> 
                            (<span class="date-1859-1937">1859–1937</span>)</a>—of planting descriptions of
                        heretofore “undiscovered” publications by modern authors in the
                        single‐author bibliographies and “bio‐bibliographical”
                        essays that catered to the fevered collecting interests of the period. Typically
                        described as small pamphlets, these publications never existed, but the genius
                        of the scam lay in the possibility of their existence, and in the convincingly
                        faked bibliographical descriptions that backed up their alleged histories. With this foundation laid, <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span> and <span class="persName-HBF">Forman</span> then
                        arranged for the pamphletsʼ forgery and their insinuation onto the market

                        and daring example of these “creative forgeries” was <span class="persName-EBB">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</span>ʼs alleged private printing 
                        in <span class="date-1847">1847</span> of the <span class="title-poem-BARRETTBROWNINGSONNETS"><i>Sonnets from the Portuguese</i></span> as a
                        gift for <span class="persName-RB">Robert</span>, a story that was fabricated
                        by <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span> and <span class="persName-HBF">Forman</span>, and that they followed up with forged physical copies for
                        auction.

                  <div class="p">Modern authorsʼ youthful works proved a ready target for such
                        fabrications, owing to the relative ease of inventing a tale about the origins
                        of a previously little known edition of a juvenile work that was itself obscure. As
                        it turned out, the editors of the <a href="/notes/library_edition_note" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JKRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span></a> of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span>,

                        were among the first to spot these spurious
                        claims. They detected the improbability of the alleged “<span class="date-1868">1868</span>” pamphlet of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs
                        juvenile prose tale, <a href="/apparatuses/leoni_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-story-JRLEONI">“Leoni”</span></a>, as well as of the 
                        “<span class="date-1849">1849</span>” pamphlet of the poem, 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/the_scythian_guest_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRSCYTHIAN">“The Scythian Guest”</span></a>; 
                        and in the <a href="/notes/library_edition_note" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span></a>ʼs bibliographical notes on those works, they commented on the suspect features of these 
                        and other pamphlets allegedly published by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>.
                        <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>ʼs doubts apparently went unremarked by many collectors, for the spurious 
                        pamphlets continued to sell, but the editorsʼ alarms helped prompt 
                        <span class="persName-HGP">Graham Pollard</span> and <span class="persName-JC">John Carter</span> to launch their investigation into questionable 
                        <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth‐century</span> pamphlets,
                        starting with the <span class="date-1847">“1847”</span>

                        Dickinson remarks that <span class="persName-WM">William Morris</span> specialists also had fingered some spurious
                        pamphlets in their field as early as <span class="date-1897">1897</span>, and
                        rare‐book dealers were on their guard by the <span class="date-1890-1899">late 1890s</span> against previously unknown modern
                        pamphlets suddenly emerging in the market [ibid., pp. 88–89].) Meanwhile, the 
                        forgersʼ obfuscations and falsehoods infiltrated the bibliographies of several modern authors—including the 
                        <a href="/notes/bibliography_of_ruskin_wise_note" target="_self"><span class="title-bibliography_text-RUSKINBIBLIOGRAPHYWISE"><i>Complete Bibliography of . . . Ruskin</i></span> (1889–93)</a>, which was started by

                        (see also <a href="/notes/forgery_and_piracy_note" target="_self">Forgery and Piracy</a>).

                  <div class="p">Despite the openings it enabled for forgery, the fashion for collecting modern “firsts” 
                        brought a number of positive scholarly developments, including an
                        interest in juvenilia and an increased and more systematic attention to
                        the bibliography of <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth‐century</span> books. The relish for first
                        editions—which for laypeople soon became synonymous with book
                        collecting—was not a feature of earlier
                        <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth‐century</span> collecting. Earlier collectors, insofar as they cared
                        about modern authors at all, had typically been drawn to later editions
                        of modern works on the presumed strength of sounder
                        editing or more lavish production. Now, because first‐edition collectors set a premium on copies that preserved the original condition of publication, 
                        bibliographers realized an opening for the scholarly study of the
                        <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth‐century</span> book, preparing the way for the New Bibliographers 
                        of the <span class="date-1901-1930">early twentieth century</span> such as <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and 
                        <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span>. The career of <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span>ʼs mentor, 
                        <span class="persName-MSS">Michael Sadleir</span>, started with collecting first editions of 
                        <span class="date-1837-06-20-1901-01-22">Victorian</span> writers,
                        especially the novelists. As late as <span class="date-1922">1922</span> in his 
                        <a href="/notes/bibliography#SADLEIREXCURSIONS" target="_self"><span class="title-book-SADLEIREXCURSIONS"><i>Excursions in Victorian Bibliography</i></span></a>, <span class="persName-MSS">Sadleir</span> could still quaintly characterize
                        first‐edition collecting as “a diversion of recent growth” pursued
                        by “hystericals” like himself. “For my part to love an
                        author is to collect him”, he explained, and the urge could be satisfied
                        only by first editions in their original condition: “Of the absurdity of
                        this I am cheerfully aware” (pp. 2, 3, 6). By
                        <span class="date-1945">1945</span>, in his contribution to the semicentennary anniversary volume of the
                        Bibliographical Society (<span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>), <span class="persName-MSS">Sadleir</span> 
                        replaced the dilettantish tone that he thought appropriate to advising
                        collectors in <span class="date-1922">1922</span> with a serious emphasis on historical bibliography and methodology. For this development, 
                        <span class="persName-MSS">Sadleir</span> willingly but guardedly credited <span class="date-1871-06-20-1901-01-22">late‐Victorian</span> book collecting, 
                        which drew attention to the bibliography of modern literature, albeit neglecting the systematic
                        study of “the changing processes, trade customs, methods of distribution
                        and book‐buyersʼ tastes” that made
                        <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth‐century</span> books “what they are”

                        book collector in one essential respect, the emphasis on biography. The aim of modern bibliography, he says, is “to weave” the investigation of book‐making
                        processes and distribution “into the lives of . . . [the booksʼ] authors, producing as
                        it were a garment of biography with a texture of bibliography”

                        modern‐author collecting formed the impediment to bibliographical method, by
                        introducing a distracting “sentimental element.” 
                        In their <span class="date-1934">1934</span> 
                     <a href="/notes/bibliography#CARTERPOLLARDENQUIRY" target="_self"><span class="title-book-CARTERPOLLARDENQUIRY"><i>Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth‐Century Pamphlets</i></span></a>, 
                        <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span> constructed a more modernist narrative to
                        explain the downfall of <span class="date-1837-06-20-1901-01-22">Victorian</span> collecting. In their view, the fashion for collecting modern firsts could never achieve scholarly method, owing to 
                        a blinding sentimentality that, combined with competitive greed,
                        led to deserved exploitation by sharpers and forgers: “As
                        the distance in time between collectors and the object of their enthusiasm
                        lessened [i.e., as collectors turned to moderns instead of
                        incunabula] their interest
                        took on a more personal colour, and the sentimental element became gradually
                        stronger. Collectors were interested in the lives and habits of their favourite
                        authors; they paid more attention to minor productions; they visualised the
                        arrival of the first copies on the authorʼs breakfast table—a
                        powerful influence in the creation of a taste for ‘original
                        condition’”

                        With this story of the rise of outmoded biographical sentiment surrounding modern
                        “firsts”, <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span> set the stage for their exposé

                        as arriving in their original wrappers on the authorʼs breakfast table. A
                        secondary implication of this narrative was that collectors had developed an
                        inordinate and ridiculous interest in modern authorsʼ juvenilia, a form of publication that was particularly targeted by <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span> and <span class="persName-HBF">Forman</span>ʼs forgeries.

                        tendency of modern‐author collecting to favor first editions of minor works:
                        among these, juvenilia are treated as a self‐evident distraction from the proper
                        aims of collecting. The conservative position was represented by 
                        <a href="/notes/roberts_william_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-WR">William Roberts</span> (<span class="date-1862-1940">1862–1940</span>)</a>,
                        writing in the <span class="title-periodical-FORTNIGHTLYREVIEW"><i>Fortnightly Review</i></span>. At this time, according to <span class="persName-BALLEN">Brian Allen</span>, <span class="persName-WR">Roberts</span> was building a career as an art critic for
                        the <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> <span class="title-periodical-TIMESLONDON"><i>Times</i></span>; and as such, his scholarship consisted in writing
                        for the art trade, outside the institutional art history establishment. His authority
                        depended on upholding normative standards for taste and expertise that he himself could wield 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#ALLENPAULMELLONSLEGACY" target="_self"><span class="persName-BALLEN">Allen</span>, <span class="title-essay-ALLENPAULMELLONSLEGACY">“Paul Mellon and Scholarship in the History of British Art”</span></a>, 45). 
                        The “craze for first editions” was a ready target, 
                        having “now reached its extremest form of childishness”, <span class="persName-WR">Roberts</span> fumed. He framed the
                        trend as an offense against “rational form” of collecting properly overseen by “scholars and
                        men of judgment” who focus on “books of importance and books with both histories
                        and reputations”, as opposed to manias pursued by “too‐zealous persons who feed
                        their own vanity by hanging on to the coat‐tails of eminent men and claim the
                        title of public benefactors by ‘resurrecting’ from a well‐merited obscurity some
                        worthless tract or obsolete and ephemeral magazine article, and trumpeting it
                        about as a masterpiece” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#ROBERTSFIRSTEDITIONMANIA" target="_self"><span class="persName-WR">Roberts</span>, <span class="title-essay-ROBERTSFIRSTEDITIONMANIA">“The First Edition Mania”</span></a>, 347, 349). 
                        On the opposing side stood <span class="persName-TJW">Thomas Wise</span>, writing in the <span class="title-periodical-BOOKMAN"><i>Bookman</i></span>. 
                        In defense of the upstart collecting, <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span> ventured a claim about modern
                        literary history, which happened to shore up the value and plausibility of the pamphlets he was secretly forging:
                        “Compositions which now find a fitting path to publicity through the medium of
                        the periodical press were formerly printed separately, and circulated in the
                        shape of a tract or pamphlet. A guide to such ephemera would be of the utmost
                        value to dealer and collector alike” (quoted in <a href="/notes/bibliography#CARTERPOLLARDENQUIRY" target="_self"><span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span>, <span class="title-book-CARTERPOLLARDENQUIRY"><i>Enquiry</i></span></a>, 106). <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and
                        <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span> looked back on this debate from the perspective of the <span class="title-book-CARTERPOLLARDENQUIRY"><i>Enquiry</i></span>, in
                        which they were exposing <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span>ʼs forgeries by means, as they saw it, of replacing dubiously fashionable tastes in
                        collecting with scientific bibliographic method. Irresistibly, they came down on <span class="persName-WR">Roberts</span>ʼs side, declaring that the “collecting public” of
                        the <span class="date-1890-1899">1890s</span> had in fact been “eager, credulous and greedy” and too “keen on the obscurer
                        rarities of its favourite authors”. Consequently, “since the obscurer and more
                        trifling” the rarity, “the greater [its] <i>réclame”</i>, collectors had been prepared
                        to go as high as £42 for the “<span class="date-1849">1849</span>” pamphlet of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs boyhood poem,

                        The mania persisted even into the present time, <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span> were grieved to report: “in <span class="date-1931">1931</span> . . . the first

                        attempted to establish a set of definitions and practices for sorting out bizarre “fashions” in collecting from good
                        “taste” and proper technique, and he suggested that undue attention to juvenilia
                        belongs among the former. According to his essay on <span class="title-essay-CARTERFASHIONS">“Fashions in

                        as less a scholarly or polemical history, than a rationale of approaches to
                        collecting based on his experiences throughout a distinguished career of book
                        dealing (<a href="/notes/bibliography#DICKINSONJOHNCARTER" target="_self">Dickinson, <span class="title-book-DICKINSONJOHNCARTER"><i>John Carter</i></span></a>, 176–81). The
                        point to be taken about such a work is that, by the <span class="date-1934-1967">mid‐twentieth
                            century</span>, it had become non‐controversial to treat the <span class="date-1837-06-20-1901-01-22">Victorian</span> collector, in <span class="persName-MSS">Sadleir</span>ʼs words, with a
                        “suspicion” that had become
                        “deeply engrained in the mind of scholars and librarians” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#SADLEIRDEVELOPMENTBIBLIOGRAPHICALSTUDY" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-SADLEIRDEVELOPMENTBIBLIOGRAPHICALSTUDY">“Development of Bibliographical Study”</span></a>, 147). The
                        problem with such suspicions, and with making such vague concepts as
                        “sentimentality” operative in a historical narrative about collecting in the
                            <span class="date-1890-1899">1890s</span>, is that <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span>ʼs normative “taste” and “technique” overwrote the debate
                        in which <span class="date-1837-06-20-1901-01-22">Victorian</span> collectors themselves engaged over the nature and role of 
                        <i>sentiment</i> for the physical book. In the 
                        <span class="date-1870-1899">1870s through the 1890s</span>, writers on
                        collecting characterized a “sentiment for the book” as a new phenomenon, and
                        the collecting community debated the nature and value of this sentiment along with
                        the goals it sponsored—such as the value of acquiring each and every
                        publication by a popular modern author, including “minor”
                        productions from juvenilia to last words, in order to form a comprehensive
                        collection of that writer (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#HANSONSENTIMENTANDMATERIALITY" target="_self"><span class="persName-DCH">Hanson</span>, <span class="title-essay-HANSONSENTIMENTANDMATERIALITY">“Sentiment and Materiality in Late‐Victorian Book Collecting”</span></a>).

                  <div class="p">For example, a popular writer of the <span class="date-1890-1899">1890s</span> on book collecting and a promoter of

                        (<span class="date-1854-1921">1854–1921</span>), used the term <i>sentiment</i> as roughly
                        synonymous with <i>bibliophily</i> to describe an appreciation
                        for the physical book as distinct, on the one hand, from utilitarian uses of
                        books, and, on the other, from fashionable or eccentric forms of collecting that
                        resulted in mutilation of books (i.e., such practices as
                        extra‐illustration or cutting out title pages or colophons to form a separate 
                        collection). Thus, <span class="persName-JHS">Slater</span> anticipated <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span>ʼs distinction between <i>fashion</i> 
                        in collecting and proper <i>taste</i> and <i>technique</i>, 
                        but he did not automatically consign <i>sentiment</i> to the effects of fashion. 
                        For <span class="persName-JHS">Slater</span>, sentiment for the book was both historically recent and a phenomenon in need of analysis:
                        “Of a truth books have only recently come to be regarded as possessing a
                        sentimental value altogether distinct from considerations of utility”

                  <div class="p">The new sentiment was perceived as forming especially around preservation of modern first editions in their original condition. In

                        regarded as the “primer” of the first edition movement

                        speculates why the sentiment for modern authorsʼ early works depended on
                        maintaining the physical copy in its original condition. Such copies, he writes, were likely to have been neglected or destroyed before the
                        authorʼs fame could bestow special interest on the publications; and
                        thus, when “these first‐fruits, crude though they generally
                        are”, come to light along with the rising fame of their author, they gain
                        an appropriate sentimental value, which is compounded by their
                        scarcity: “the fact that many people want the few copies that have
                        escaped the wrack of neglect, makes them objects of unusual interest. The
                        inevitable reprint comes at last, but it is not the same; sentiment still hangs
                        around the shabby volume of years ago, with all its errors” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#SLATEREARLYEDITIONS" target="_self"><span class="persName-JHS">Slater</span>, <span class="title-book-SLATEREARLYEDITIONS"><i>Early Editions</i></span></a>, vii).

                  <div class="p">To account for the formation of this sentiment, 
                        <span class="persName-JHS">Slater</span> points to a number of possible origins. The
                        collecting of modern book illustration, which started earlier in the century,
                        instigated a search for early editions for the sake of sharper,
                        early‐state impressions of engravings and woodcuts. Another cause of
                        collectorsʼ sentiment for original condition was the interest in tracing textual revisions by favorite modern
                        authors through successive editions—a scholarly attraction prompted by a tendency of certain 
                        modern writers, such as <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span>, to publish successive, revised versions of their work 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#SLATEREARLYEDITIONS" target="_self"><span class="persName-JHS">Slater</span>, <span class="title-book-SLATEREARLYEDITIONS"><i>Early Editions</i></span></a>, v–vii;

                        latter interest, <span class="persName-JHS">Slater</span> does reflect a sentimentality in <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and
                        <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span>ʼs sense of the collectorʼs imaginary closeness to the life
                        of a favorite author. Dramatizing the appeal of the first edition, <span class="persName-JHS">Slater</span> evokes a
                        “personal connection” with the author: “It may be assumed
                        that the author has in the vast majority of cases seen and handled the book for
                        which he was himself responsible; the very copy we hold in our hand may have
                        belonged to him.” Despite such over‐dramatization, <span class="persName-JHS">Slater</span>ʼs
                        idea of a sentiment driving a nascient textual criticism of modern literature is
                        legitimately scholarly, and not merely nostalgic: first
                        editions, he argues, supply the possibility of tracing “the working of the
                        authorʼs mind by a comparison of the wording of one edition with that of
                        another”, and of understanding “why [the author] made the
                        alterations” and even “enter[ing] into [the
                        authorʼs] thoughts, and perhaps . . . appreciat[ing] his feelings” about such revisions

                  <div class="p">During the height of the perceived craze, the <i>sentiment</i> for early editions was not necessarily controversial in itself. 
                        Whereas <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span> later presented the movement in two‐dimensional terms—opponents 
                        and supporters ranged on either side of the issue, as besotted amateurs deranged the rare‐book market with heedless investments in valueless stock—the 
                        sentiment for the materiality of early editions was recognized on both sides as a discovey worth serious attention. 
                        When <span class="persName-WR">William Roberts</span> collected his <span class="title-periodical-FORTNIGHTLYREVIEW"><i>Fortnightly</i></span> essays in book form, 
                        he moderated his attitude: though continuing to berate the “cult” surrounding firsts, he confessed to sharing an
                        appreciation of the “charm [that] is so much a matter of feeling” in the
                        “attraction of a first edition”. While insisting on reserving for professional scrutiny the features of a 
                        first edition that, to a bibliographer, are “much more than sentimental” (i.e., 
                        analytical bibliographic description of papers, typefaces, and bindings that have fallen
                        out of fashion), <span class="persName-WR">Roberts</span> admits that the appeal of an early edition “falls into the category of
                        things which are not explainable” to “the utilitarian”. The shabby volume is
                        “esteemed as bringing our sons or grandsons nearer than any amount of written
                        description to our own ‘old’ times”. The pleasure is “spiritual” and the
                        “experience . . . a thing of feeling and not of argument”

                        has caused commercial disasters in the auction rooms, <span class="persName-WR">Roberts</span> complains, while supplying no scholarly benefits. Granted, for writers who are not represented by a collected edition, 
                        “there would be some excuse for a series of the separately issued volumes . . . , but a complete collection of the first and every subsequent edition is altogether too absurd,

                        comprehensive collecting was expressed on the <span class="placeName-USA">American</span> side, as on the English. 
                        <span class="persName-FWH">Francis Whiting Halsey</span>, a journalist prominent in book reviewing for the New York newspapers, wrote in <span class="date-1902">1902</span> with some alarm over the

                        including the “large volume of reprints” and modern editions.
                        While <span class="persName-FWH">Halsey</span> commented favorably on the high demand for modern
                        firsts in <span class="persName-USA">America</span> as in <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>, 
                        and treated the reprint houses as performing a public service arising from their sympathy with
                        favorite authors, he is dubious about the state of the market for such collecting: 
                        “In <span class="placeName-USA">this country</span> it is early, choice, or curious editions of
                        standard modern authors that fetch large sums” in spite of “sharp

                  <div class="p">In the lively competition among collectors to make their modern author
                        collections comprehensive, the controversy arose in part, as <span class="persName-FWH">Halsey</span> suggests, from a perceived
                        distortion of pricing in the market for rarities. For <span class="persName-WR">William Roberts</span>, excessive value
                        was placed on copies of minor publications as compared with canonical works:
                        “Where a collector desires to have a complete series of the works written by the
                        author or authors to whom he devotes his attention”, <span class="persName-WR">Roberts</span> remarked, a handful of
                        first editions took on a disproportionate value merely because “they are
                        exceedingly rare, and . . . that is about as much as can be urged in their
                        favour”. In the case of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, for example, the value of first editions of the
                        major works had declined in the market, while “the publications of Mr. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>
                        which more than maintain their commercial value are those which are quite
                        unknown except to the specialist. They are little pamphlets and tracts, which
                        were, for the most part, printed in exceedingly small numbers, and are now
                        practically unprocurable. Although there are about a dozen collectors who have
                        spared neither time nor money to render their Ruskiniana complete, we believe
                        that not more than one can claim to have an absolutely final series of the works
                        of the ‘master’. A rough calculation places the value of a complete set of
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> at not much short of £300 for about sixty distinct publications”

                        remarking for example that <span class="persName-EBB">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</span>ʼs girlhood volume,

                        most other early productions of authors who subsequently become famous”; that
                        is, it should be “valued not so much on account of its intrinsic merit as for
                        the circumstances attending its production, the personality of the writer, and its excessive rarity” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#SLATEREARLYEDITIONS" target="_self"><span class="persName-JHS">Slater</span>, <span class="title-book-SLATEREARLYEDITIONS"><i>Early Editions</i></span></a>, 40–41).
                        Realizing the fears of conservatives like <span class="persName-WR">Roberts</span>, who lamented that an appreciation of
                        canonical monuments would be displaced by an obsession with insignificant pamphlets, the new collecting threatened not only to inflate market prices 
                        temporarily but also to debase the reverence that ought fundamentally to motivate bibliographical study, and instead to ground scholarship in thorough materialism. In an

                            (<span class="date-1840-1914">1840–1914</span>)</a> styled himself as a “complete [i.e., comprehensive]
                        bibliographer” as distinct from a “collector”, and in that capacity he pronounced
                        “the prices at which scarce books in favour with collectors have found a
                        market in these latter days” to be less objectionable in themselves than in 
                        the consequent tendency he perceived among writers on collecting like 
                        <span class="persName-JHS">Slater</span> to rank the importance of modern first
                        editions by their market value rather than by their solely bibliographical
                        significance; yet, unlike <span class="persName-WR">Roberts</span>, <span class="persName-WFP">Prideaux</span> refused to measure bibliographical significance in terms of literary importance. 
                        From his standpoint as a “complete bibliographer”,
                        “the bibliographical importance of one book by any particular author is
                        as great as the bibliographical importance of any other book by the same writer.
                        Each book marks a stage in the growth or decadence of the writerʼs
                        art”; and to “those who wish to trace [an authorʼs]

                        As <span class="persName-MSS">Michael Sadleir</span> would later remark, the proliferation of these single‐author bibliographies

                            <span class="persName-WFP">Prideaux</span> was perhaps correct to set apart

Yet even the handlists of publications by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and of other writers that

                        and he carried his <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> bibliography through five editions in pursuit of that goal. 
                        <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> anticipated <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span> and <span class="persName-JPS">Smart</span> in identifying <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs earliest publications.

                  <div class="p">Like the collecting of modern firsts itself, the reprint and bibliography industry that supported the movement irritated detractors. 
                        <span class="persName-WR">Roberts</span> was annoyed that “every little volume of drivelling verse” and other “ephemera” could be 
                        “heralded as a wonderful and valuable piece of literature” by publicists (<a href="/notes/bibliography#ROBERTSFIRSTEDITIONMANIA" target="_self"><span class="persName-WR">Roberts</span>, <span class="title-essay-ROBERTSFIRSTEDITIONMANIA">“The First Edition Mania”</span></a>, 347, 349). 
                        To the editors of the <span class="title-periodical-ATHENAEUM"><i>Athenaeum</i></span>, it was a matter of “astonishment and regret that publishers can be found for such undertakings” as reprints and “ana” volumes—the 
                        kinds of labors for which <a href="/notes/shepherd_r_h_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-RHS">Richard Herne Shepherd</span></a> was known 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#REVIEWBARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-REVIEWBARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878">Unsigned review of <span class="title-book-BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878"><i>The Earlier Poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning</i></span></span></a>, 766). 
                        <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> was perhaps the most prolific compiler of single‐author bibliographies, and he
                        was inventive and industrious in developing other kinds of publications serving the new
                        collecting interests. He edited reprints of neglected works by modern authors, and compiled 
                        “ana” volumes, which constructed a biographical narrative using selected earlier
                        versions of texts that authors subsequently revised (e.g., <a href="/notes/bibliography#SHEPHERDTENNYSONIANA" target="_self"><span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>, <span class="title-book-"><i>Tennysoniana</i></span></a>). 
                        Such publications made <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> a target by authors who resented seeing their early and ephemeral texts, and
                        earlier versions of their more canonical texts, revived in the form of edited reprints or aids to study like the “ana” volume. 
                        Hostile authors and their representatives, such as reviewers for the <span class="title-periodical-ATHENAEUM"><i>Athenaeum</i></span>, attacked <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> and his ilk 
                        as <i>vampires</i> and as <i>resurrection men</i>, meaning <i>body snatchers</i>. 
                        <span class="persName-AT">Tennyson</span> was
                        particularly hostile to the reprint industry, which he regarded as mere piracy, and he led the way in taking legal action against <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> 
                        and other editors and publishers engaged in such activity.

                  <div class="p">At the core of these court cases was a question of authorsʼ control over their <i>oeuvre</i> and

                        When <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> placed a notice in the press that this reprint was forthcoming, 
                        <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> asked the <span class="title-periodical-ATHENAEUM"><i>Athenaeum</i></span> to denounce the project, arguing that its most substantial text,

                        finally appeared in <span class="date-1877-12">late 1877</span>, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> had bent to <span class="persName-RB">Robert Browning</span>ʼs wishes 
                        so far as to exclude the <span class="date-1833">1833</span> version of <span class="title-drama-AESCHYLUSPROMETHEUSBOUND1833"><i>Prometheus Bound</i></span>, but he 
                        retained <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett Browning</span>ʼs shorter poems that filled out the original <span class="date-1833">1833</span> volume. 
                        Because <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett Browning</span>ʼs juvenile publications were out of copyright, 
                        and copies readily available to <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>ʼs inspection 
                        in the British Library for transcription and editing, 
                        the legality of the reprint had to be admitted by the <span class="title-periodical-ATHENAEUM"><i>Athenaeum</i></span>. The journalʼs editors nonetheless expressed indignation that 
                        the authorʼs spouse could lose control over the public domain of <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett Browning</span>ʼs 
                        youthful publications, and the journal proceeded to attack <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> on ethical grounds: 
                        “Were it a question of tables or chairs, <span class="persName-RB">Mr. Browning</span> could defend the wishes of his 
                        <span class="persName-EBB">wife</span>; but in the case of poems, our wise laws give him no 
                        remedy, and <span class="persName-RB">Mr. Shepherd</span> is quite at liberty to defy the wishes of the dead, and to outrage the feelings of the living”

                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> replied to this charge by boldly asserting the scholarʼs right to materials for study, and 
                        denying that “a poet himself, or the relations of a poet, may . . . always be the best or the final judges of what should continue to hold a place 
                        in the collection of his writings”; and that far from intending an outrage of the authorʼs feelings, the “poetical student” 
                        owned a rightful claim to studying the authorʼs development, starting with the earliest flowering of literary genius—the “nameless and 
                        peculiar charm” to be found in the “early spring” of an authorʼs juvenilia

                        This declaration by <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> of the significance of juvenilia in a writer's development, 
                        and of the “poetical studentʼs” right of access to such material, was met with more than derision by

                        the writer, <span class="persName-TWD">Theodore Watts‐Dunton</span>, attacked not only the morality and professionalism of the reprintʼs editor and publisher, 
                        but also the credibility and even the national interest of this view of poetics and the study of an authorʼs development. 
                        “Early printing” by authors of promise must be discouraged, <span class="persName-TWD">Watts‐Dunton</span> demanded; 
                        and insofar as the publication of juvenilia proves “necessary to the full development of a countryʼs literary potentialities”, 
                        such publication should be regulated, like the young author himself or herself, in order to “discharge” as much “nonsense” 
                        as possible to the benefit the nationʼs literary history

                        According to <span class="persName-TWD">Watts‐Dunton</span>, the health of the nationʼs literary culture depended on the suppression of modern authorsʼ juvenilia.

                  <div class="p">In <span class="date-1879-06">June 1879</span>, <span class="persName-RHS">Richard Herne Shepherd</span> pressed a libel suit against the <span class="title-periodical-ATHENAEUM"><i>Athenaeum</i></span> 
                        for accusing him of dishonesty and vampirism, among other slanders. <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> won his case, securing £150 in damages, 
                        not long after <span class="persName-JAMW">James McNeill Whistler</span> achieved a merely Pyrrhic victory of a farthingʼs worth of damages 
                        in his <span class="date-1878-11">November 1878</span> libel trial against <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>. Both libel suits were concerned at a fundamental level 
                        with questions of artistic or literary value and the authority for determining such value and holding public sway over such determinations. The issues never arose between 
                        between <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> or the 
                        Brantwood Circle, because <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> never attempted to reprint works by 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, and so a more straightforward violation of intellectual property never brought forward the grander issues of artistic value 
                        and authority. (The true property thief, <span class="persName-TJW">T. J. Wise</span>, meanwhile went undetected. In <span class="date-1934">1934</span>, 
                        when he was finally accused of forgery, <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span> tried to pin the crime on <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>; and both he and <span class="persName-HBF">Forman</span> 
                        had evidently tried to confuse the trail by forging <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>ʼs piracies! See

                        peculiar charm” to be found in the “early spring” of an authorʼs juvenilia.

                        pre‐empted any attempted piracy by printing <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs early work themselves.

                  <div class="p">When <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> began sending installments of his bibliography to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, 
                        the latter responded appreciatively to its “perfect reckoning up of me”, although he added: “I will not say that you have wasted your time; 
                        but I may at least regret the quantity of trouble”. Despite this diffidence, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was 
                        “especially glad to have note of the letters to newspapers”, which <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> had unearthed 
                        (referring to letters reprinted in <span class="title-book-JRARROWS"><i>Arrows of the Chase</i></span> [<span class="date-1880">1880</span>]; see

                        Whether or not <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and his circle were aware of <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>ʼs reputation for piracy 
                        (the exchange predated <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>ʼs successful libel suit), 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> moved quickly to appoint his former Oxford student, <a href="/notes/wedderburn_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-AW">Alexander Wedderburn</span> (d. <span class="date-1931">1931</span>)</a>, 
                        to edit a reprint of these fugitive newspaper pieces. The resulting miscellanies 
                        came to be entitled <span class="title-book-JRARROWS"><i>Arrows of the Chase</i></span> (<span class="date-1880">1880</span>) and <span class="title-book-"><i>On the Old Road</i></span> (<span class="date-1885">1885</span>).

                        (and whose talents for careful editorial labor resembled <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>ʼs, minus the dubious ethics).  
                        <span class="title-book-JRARROWS"><i>Arrows of the Chase</i></span>, as an anthology of the public letters to newspapers, could extend no further back than what

                        which opened with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʽs boyhood letters to the writers

                        and it appears that, far from objecting to the new collecting trend, or to the publishing industry supporting its enthusiasts, 
                        the Brantwood circle stepped forward to supply such publications on their own.

                        <span class="placeName-building-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span> that presented sample entries focused specifically on juvenilia. 
                        While the sample entries boldly included, along with the <a href="/notes/bibliography#POEMS1850" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1850"><i>Poems</i></span> (<span class="date-1850">1850</span>)</a>,

                        the featuring of juvenilia in such a prospectus would not necessarily have been viewed as eccentric. 
                        After all, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself, in his autobiography, <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span> (begun in <span class="date-1885">1885</span>), 
                        had included not only detailed accounts of his early writing, but even a typographic and engraved facsimile of some of his juvenilia, 
                        as “an extremely perfect type of the . . . temper of my mind, at the beginning of days just as much as at their end” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 35:56). 
                        In expressing thanks to <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span> and <span class="persName-JPS">Smart</span> for their prospectus, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was therefore disingenuous in commenting to them, as he similarly said to <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>, that 
                        they had taken too much “trouble over a lot of worthless stuff”

                        For the emphasis of the prospectus was in keeping with collectorsʼ sentiment for modern firsts in original condition, and with readersʼ interest 
                        in the textual origins of modern writing. The prospectus was also in keeping with themes in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs autobiographical writing, 
                        and with the Brantwood circleʼs anthologizing of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs juvenilia.

                        However, <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span> apparently never succeeded in gaining an entrée to <span class="placeName-building-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span>, 
                        and he obtained no purchase on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscript treasures

                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs guard appears to have raised, too, by <span class="persName-TWD">Watts‐Dunton</span> and the <span class="title-periodical-ATHENAEUM"><i>Athenaeum</i></span>ʽs animadversions on the activities of 
                        literary “resurrection men”. In the introduction to <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS4D1891"><i>Poems</i></span> (<span class="date-1891">1891</span>), 
                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> seems anxious to anticipate and exonerate himself from the charge that a finely produced edition of 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs juvenilia could have been actuated only by an editorʼs greed, 
                        or that republication of “minor” work must have violated the rights and wishes of the author—the 
                        baseness that the <span class="title-periodical-ATHENAEUM"><i>Athenaeum</i></span> attributed to reprint “hacks” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#REVIEWBARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-REVIEWBARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878">Unsigned review of <span class="title-book-BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878"><i>The Earlier Poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning</i></span></span></a>, 765). 
                        Pre‐empting such criticism, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> relays the biographical justification for the study of juvenilia: 
                        “There is always a peculiar interest in watching development, in witnessing growth”. He invokes a metaphor that <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> had also used for the child genius as nature, 
                        “the bursting into bud and leaf of a new poetic genius” 
                        (a somewhat different metaphor from <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span>ʼs idea of the childʼs genius developing <i>in</i> nature) 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS4D1891" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS4D1891"><i>Poems</i></span> [4<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>]</a>, 1:xix;

                        But <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> also jealously links his “sympathy” for child genius to “ownership”; 
                        he erects a barrier against <span class="persName-RHD">Shepherd</span>ʼs suggestion that “poetical students” 
                        may be better judges of what should be preserved from authorsʼ childhood writing than the authors themselves or their families, 
                        and that once “poems have been fully given to the world”, they become “the worldʼs possessions”, the wards of 
                        “poetical students [who] will not allow them to die, however indifferent the general public may be to them” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#LITERARYGOSSIPDEC76" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-LITERARYGOSSIPDEC76">“Mrs. Browningʼs Earlier Poems”</span></a>, 722). 
                        In contrast, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> keeps the collector at bay: “When we have seen a plant burst the soil, . . . it is our own”, 
                        he emphasizes. “As we follow . . . [the] first steps [of great men] . . . they become our own by sympathy”. 
                        The plural third‐person pronoun allows some comaraderie with collectors without necessarily sharing possession: 
                        “It is no idle curiosity, then, that prompts the admirers of <span class="persName-JR">Mr. Ruskin</span>ʼs works 
                        to collect his boyish writings and to learn the story of his youth”

                  <div class="p">This coolness did not deter collectors from seeking <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> rarities. Despite <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span>

                        <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> would soon categorize as the bizarre “fashion” of such minor fare as juvenilia 
                        distorting the market. Surprisingly high auction prices were by commanded by early <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscripts 
                        as compared to prices for manuscripts of works written in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs maturity. 
                        At the <a href="/notes/provenance_sothebys_1930_note" target="_self">Sothebyʼs Sale of Ruskin Manuscripts and Library, <span class="date-1930">1930</span></a>

                        manuscripts associated with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs youth sold for prices competitive with those for manuscripts of such canonical works 
                        as <span class="title-book-JRSTONESOFVENICE"><i>The Stones of Venice</i></span>; and prices given for early manuscripts were often were significantly greater than those given for manuscripts of late works. 
                        It is possibly a sign of the ongoing “mania” for “firsts” and “early editions”, 
                        that these early manuscripts were sold alongside modern <span class="date-1801-1900">(i.e., nineteenth‐century)</span> first editions: 
                        the <span class="date-1930">1930</span> sale included presentation copies by modern authors from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs library, 
                        along with a prominent lot of books, drawings, and letters by the childrenʼs author and illustrator, <span class="persName-CKG">Kate Greenaway</span> 
                        (the latter underscoring associations with childhood, as well); 
                        and the <span class="date-1931">1931</span> sale included a “small library . . . of modern authors” 
                        unrelated to the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collection, as well as more modern firsts from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs library, 
                        including correspondence by modern authors to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>. Perhaps the association of these lots indicates that, 
                        as late as <span class="date-1930-1931">1930–31</span>, the collecting of modern‐author firsts helped to buoy 
                        the prices for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs manuscript juvenilia, just as <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span> 
                        remarked with dismay the princely sum given as recently as <span class="date-1931">1931</span> for a juvenile 
                        publication by <span class="persName-RCB">Rupert Brooke</span>. If these associations still held held force, Sothebyʼs 
                        auctioned the early Ruskin manuscripts in the nick of time, for after <span class="date-1934">1934</span> 
                        vestiges of the late‐Victorian collecting phenomenon would succumb to <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span>ʼs 
                        exposé of forgery and their modernist contempt for <span class="date-1837-06-20-1901-01-22">Victorian</span> sentimentality.
