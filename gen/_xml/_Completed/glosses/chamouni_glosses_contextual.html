                        the spectator enjoyed a prospect “of two leagues up the valley” between the needles that was filled by the glacier. “The view of this enormous sea of ice 
                        is one of the most striking in these scenes of wonder, but its great extent, from the vast size of every object about it, is very deceptive. Directly across the <span class="geogName-MERDEGLACE">Mer de Glace</span>

                        and the opposite meadows, by a path which leads across the valley to the foot of the <span class="geogName-MONTANVERT">Montanvert</span>, where the path rises above the valley, 
                        through the forest of pines which skirts the base of the mountain, in some places very steep. . .el . After a scramble amidst rocks, and the roots of 
                        <span class="name--PINE">pine</span>s and <span class="name--LARCH">larch</span>es, occasional openings among the trees afford peeps into the valley, 
                        and mark the great height so rapidly attained. Sometimes <i>crues</i> are crossed—the channels of avalanches in the winter, which sweep down every thing 
                        in their course. Here the guides generally perform the <i>mystery</i> of desiring silence, lest a whisper should disturb the slumbering snows above, 
                        and bring down destruction by displacing a rock”. Despite <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span>ʼs skepticism about these mysteries, <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span>

                    Along the way, they crossed from the <span class="placeName-GENEVACANTON">canton of Geneva</span> into the domain of the <span class="placeName-SARDINIAKINGDOM">Kingdom of Sardinia</span>, 
                    following a road that, as described by <span class="persName-JM">John Murray III</span> in his <span class="date-1838">1838</span> guidebook to <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span>, 
                    “is carried through the defile on the borders of the river [the <span class="geogName-ARVE">Arve</span>], and beneath precipices, that mark the first grand entrance into an alpine ravine. 
                    The valley is very narrow, nearly all the way to <span class="placeName-MAGLAND">Maglan</span>, and, in some places, the road is straitened in between the river and the bases of precipices, 
                    which actually overhang the traveller. From some of these, a little out of the road, the steep talus of rocks and stones which have fallen from above, spread out to the river, 
                    and the road rises over the ridges. The banks the river are well wooded, and the scenery is as beautiful as it is wild. . . . About a league and half beyond <span class="placeName-MAGLAND">Maglan</span>, 
                    the road passes close to one of the highest waterfalls in <span class="placeName-SAVOY">Savoy</span>, that of <span class="geogName-NANTARPENAZ">Nant dʼ Arpenaz</span>”

               <div class="p">Besides confirming <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs impression of entering a “cliffy defile”, <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span>ʼs description 
                        of the waterfall is worth transcribing, since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> contributed a brief commentary on the geology of the <span class="geogName-NANTARPENAZ">Nant dʼ Arpenaz</span>

                        <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> continues: “the stream is small, and before it reaches half its first descent it is broken into spray. After storms, however, its volume 
                        falls on the rock, on which it breaks; after reaching the slope or talus, formed by the soil and stones it has brought down, it rusthes across the road beneath a bridge, 
                        and flows into the <span class="geogName-ARVE">Arve</span>. The rock of brown limestone, from which it descends is remarkable for its tortuous stratification, forming a vast curve, 
                        and the face of the rock is so denuded that its structure is pefectly seen”

                        <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span> massif suddenly come into view: “Between the <span class="geogName-NANTARPENAZ">fall of Arpenaz</span> and [the village of] 
                        <span class="placeName-STMARTINSAVOY">St. Martin</span>, the valley increases in width, and rich fields spread . . . ; the peaks of the <span class="geogName-AIGUILLEDEVARAN">Varens</span> 
                        [appear], which rise nearly 8000 feet above the level of the sea, and immediately over the village of <span class="placeName-STMARTINSAVOY">St. Martin</span>, which now opens to the view. . . . 
                        [In the village,] a bridge crosses the <span class="geogName-ARVE">Arve</span>, and leads to the town of <span class="placeName-SALLANCHES">Sallenches</span>. . . . On this bridge 
                        one of the noblest views on the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> is presented of <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span>: its actual distance to the peak is more than 
                        12 miles in a direct line, yet so sharp, and bright, and clear in every part of its stupendous mass, that the eye, unused to such magnitude with distinctness, is utterly deceived, 
                        and would rather lead to the belief that it was not one third of the distance. On looking up the valley over the broad winter‐bed of the <span class="geogName-ARVE">Arve</span> however, 
                        objects recede, and give the accustomed impressions of distance; above this rises the mountain of the Forclaz, its sides clothed with pines, and its summit with pasturage. 
                        Over these, are seen the <span class="geogName-AIGUILLEDUGOUTER">Aiguille de Goutè</span>, the <span class="geogName-DOMEDUGOUTER">Dome de Goutè</span>, 
                        and the head of the loftiest mountain in Europe, propped by ridges of aiguilles, and the intervals of these filled with glaciers. This one view, the first usually enjoyed by travellers 
                        from <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span> to <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamouny</span>, is so impressive as to be generally acknowledged a sufficient reward for the journey“

                        they could not engage a guide, who would have been fined for leading an excursion prior to church service. Accordingly, <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span> writes, 
                        they engaged a guideʼs little boy, who had helped lead them on the previous dayʼs trek up the <span class="geogName-MONTANVERT">Montanvert</span>. The child 
                        “made his appearance, dressed in his Sunday clothes which all seemed made to allow for his growing. The poor child seemed buried under them especially the hat which might have done 
                        for his father”. They set out on the the previous dayʼs easy path to the source of the <span class="geogName-ARVERON">Arveyron</span>, but found a steeper path, 
                        which interested the Ruskins but tired the boy. Excusing the boy to return to the village, the party pushed onward, until they found where the path divides, leading two ways 
                        through the mountain pass to <span class="placeName-MARTIGNY">Martigny</span>. One direction led to the <span class="geogName-COLDEBALME">Col de Balme</span>, and the other 
                        to the <span class="geogName-TETENOIRE">Tête Noire</span> pass. They took the latter fork, which according to <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> offered superior scenery. 
                        <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> comments that the scenery soon “got very wild, and hills began to look bare but grand, and on looking behind we had a splendid view of the <span class="geogName-AGUILLEDARGENTIERE">Aiguille d’Argentière</span> seen in all its beauty”

                    was overborne by poetic tropes that deemed the mountainʼs needles “entirely inaccessible” to humankind and inhabited solely by “spirits”. Other British Protestant tourists were drawn

                    and pure and chaste as were the light clouds that lingered round it, they were dark, compared with its superior brightness; while the obscurity in which they
                    wrapt the inferior mountains, gave to that which we beheld an appearance of still greater elevation, and rendered it like a crystal mountain in a sea of clouds. 
                    The southern needle of <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span>, too, was fully dismantled, and shewed its beautiful point to the enraptured eye. It seemed as if the parting clouds had afforded us
