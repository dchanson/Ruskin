                    leaving a vertical column measuring approximately nine lines of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs cursive copperplate script, it is reasonable to assume that 
                    he intended to paste a drawing here, but never produced it, or that he produced a drawing, but it has been removed or lost.</div>

                        is a drawing dated “about <span class="date-1834">1834</span>”, <span class="title-artwork-JRHOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPROUTCOPY"><span class="placeName-building-HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELS">Hotel de Ville</span>, <span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span>, after <span class="persName-SP">Samuel Prout</span></span>, 
                        which is described as a “copy” that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> “reduced to miniature scale” from a larger drawing of the same subject. The latter drawing, also a copy after

                        the most likely purpose for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> to have reduced the larger drawing in <span class="date-1834">1834</span> would have been to fit the space above the the section header for <span class="title-composite-JRBRUSSELSCOMP">“<span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span>”</span>.

                    does not appear to be intended as part of “<span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span>” itself; and the hand may not be <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs, 
                    although the formation of the terminal <i>d</i> is more characteristic of his hand than of <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs, 
                    whose handwriting can sometimes be confused her sonʼs. The word seems to form an imperative; and while no other clue remains to indicate what was to be “minded”, 
                    the word may be a metamark (see <a href="/notes/editorial_rationale_note#METAMARKS" target="_self">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology: Element, Attribute, and Value Usage—Metamarks</a>).</div></span><br><br>
