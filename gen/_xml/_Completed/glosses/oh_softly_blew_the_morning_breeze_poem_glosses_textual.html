                    the place, <span class="placeName-">Chiavenna</span>, in his poem, he did not entitle the poem in draft. <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> assigned the title 
                    “<span class="placeName-">Chiavenna</span>” in <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i></span> (<span class="date-1891">1891</span>), but he neglected his rule 
                    of using square brackets to indicate editorial intervention. In the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>, <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> carried over the title without comment 
                    or supplying the appropriate brackets. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="title-bibliography_text-JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan for Continuation of the “Account”</span> 
                    does not include a proposed section heading entitled “Chiavenna”, suggesting that he may have intended to include this untitled poem as part of another section. 
                    The likeliest candidate in the <span class="title-bibliography_text-JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan</span> is 
                    <a href="/witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii#ACCOUNTTOCITALIA" target="_self"><span class="title-composite-JRITALIACOMP">“Italia, Italia”</span></a>, 
                    which immediately follows the sections concerning crossing the mountain pass and the descent.</div>

                    In the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft, the latter word does appear to have been <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs first thought—the 
                    original is difficult decipher—but that word is definitely overwritten as <i>morning</i>. The revision makes sense as a contrast with the “mantle white” 
                    of “fresh snow” that “had fallʼn that night”. According to <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span>, the Ruskins arrived in 
                    <span class="placeName-CHIAVENNA">Chiavenna</span> around seven oʼclock in the evening, 
                    following their day‐long descent from <span class="placeName-SPLUGEN">Splügen</span>, and they departed at six oʼclock in the morning
