                  <div class="p">Queen Victoria, when traveling north in late August 1842 on her first visit to Scotland, 
                    commented in her journal on the wooded enclosure of the ravine compared to the preceding flat and barren landscape: 
                    "[W}e entered Kinross-shire. Soon after, the country grew prettier, and the hills appeared again, partly wooded. 
                    We passed Loch Leven, and saw the castle on the lake from which poor Queen Mary escaped. 
                    There the country is rather flat, and the hills are only on one side. . . . Soon after [the village of Kinross], 
                    the mountains, which are rather barren, began to appear. Then we passed the valley of Glen Farg; 
                    the hills are very high on each side, and completely wooded down to the bottom of the valley, 
                    where a small stream runs on one side of the road--it is really lovely".</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Victoria remarks that, "[o]n leaving this valley", one arrives "in Perthshire", 
                        announced by "a beautiful view of Strathearn and Moncrieffe Hill"--a prospect, that is, 
                        of the wide valley of the River Earn stretching to Moncrieffe Hill, which rises beyond the village 
                        of Bridge of Earn, extending east-northeast. On the far side of the hill lies the city of Perth. 
                        For the queen's entourage, the journey took two hours from entering Kinross-shire, 
                        traversing Glenfarg, changing horses at Bridge of Earn, to reaching their destination of Dupplin Castle, 
                        the residence of the Early of Kinnoul, a few miles west of Bridge of Earn--the 
                        "last part of the road very bad traveling, up and down hill"

                    In the sole extant manuscript version, which is a fair copy, there is no evidence of erasure of a word. If a word is missing, it would therefore have been dropped in fair‐copying. 
                    <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> based his assumption that a word is missing, presumably, on the need of a word ending the second line in the stanza to complete the <i>abab</i> rhyme scheme. 
                    He is likely correct that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intended “lost” to rhyme with “tost”, 
                    since the dependency on the pole star to find oneʼs way when lost in the dark is consistent with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs probable sources 
                    for learning about the constellations, which typically begin with this practical use of <span class="name--CHARLESSWAIN">Charlesʼs Wain</span>.</div></span><br><br>
