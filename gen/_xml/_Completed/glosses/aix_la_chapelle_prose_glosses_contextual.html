                  <div class="p">The settlements ending eighteenth‐century wars on the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span> were significant to British tradesmen like the Ruskins, <span class="persName-LC">Linda Colley</span> argues; 
                    merchants viewed these conflicts favorably, “particularly before <span class="date-1775">1775</span>”, as having filled “the pockets of a multitude of [British] commercial pawns. . . . 
                    <span class="date-1701-1714">[T]he War of Spanish Succession</span>, the <span class="date-1740-1748">War of Austrian Succession</span> and, above all, the <span class="date-1756-1763">Seven Years War</span> seemed to many traders abundantly worthwhile”. 
                    The <span class="date-1756-1763">Seven Years War</span>, especially, she says, seemed “the high point of the interplay between commercial interests and British imperial aggression”, 
                    as its settlement helped “British exports [to] reach a record level” and resulted in taking captive “vast areas of the world” for <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#BRITONS" target="_self"><span class="persName-LC">Colley</span>, <span class="title-book-BRITONS"><i>Britons</i></span></a>, 99).
                    For similar reasons, tradesmen supported the Peace of Aix‐la‐Chapelle concluding the <span class="date-1740-1748">War of Austrian Succession</span>.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">In a popular history of modern times that (in its first version of <span class="date-1757-1758">1757–58</span>) 
                    ended with the latter treaty, <span class="persName-TGS">Tobias Smollett</span> (<span class="date-1721-1771">1721–71</span>) reflects <span class="persName-LC">Colley</span>ʼs assessment of tradesmenʼs views, albeit tempering the popular view with his characteristic skepticism: 
                    “The <i>Peace of Aix‐la‐Chapelle</i>, however unstable or inglorious it might appear to those few who understood the interests, and felt for the honour of their country, 
                    was nevertheless not unwelcome to the nation in general. . . . The English . . . had suffered considerable losses and interruption in the article of commerce, 
                    which was the source of their national opulence and power. . . . To a people influenced by these considerations, the restoration of a free trade, [and] 
                    the respite from that anxiety and suspense which the prosecution of a war never fails to engender, . . . were advantages that sweetened the bitter draught 
                    of a dishonourable treaty, and induced the majority of the nation to acquiesce in the peace, not barely without murmuring, but even with some degree of satisfaction and applause” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#SMOLLETTHISTORYOFENGLAND" target="_self"><span class="persName-TGS">Smollett</span>, <span class="title-book-SMOLLETTHISTORYOFENGLAND"><i>History of England</i></span></a>, 3:218–19;

                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-LC">Colley</span> looks to this kind of sentiment as evidence of her larger thesis that “the relationship between the [British] trading interest on the one hand, and the landed 
                    interest that dominated the legislature and policy‐making on the other, though by no means an equal or an invariably tranquil one, was for much of the eighteenth century 
                    and after mutually beneficial. Trade was not only an indispensable part of the British economy, but also vital for the stateʼs revenue and naval power. 
                    In return, traders depended on the state for the maintenance of civil order, for sympathetic legislation, for protection in peace and war, and for access to captive markets overseas”. 
                    Although this mutually supportive relationship between land and trade was later frayed by the protracted <span class="date-1799-11-09-1815-06-18">Napoleonic conflict</span>, which was costly to British trade, 
                    the relationship was for many Britons the foundation of patriotism. This was especially the case for Tory Lowland Scots like the Ruskins, whose patriotism intensified 
                    following the failed invasion in <span class="date-1745">1745</span> by the Young Pretender, <span class="persName-PCES">Prince Charles Edward Stuart</span>, who was supported by Highland Scots. 
                    Both in the midst and in the aftermath of that crisis, <span class="persName-LC">Colley</span> argues, 
                    Jacobitism was defeated not only by British Protestantism and anti‐Catholic fervor but also by fear of civil war, apprehension of loss of lives and property, 
                    and the belief that successful Jacobitism would lend an advantage in trade to <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span> 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#BRITONS" target="_self"><span class="persName-LC">Colley</span>, <span class="title-book-BRITONS"><i>Britons</i></span></a>, 71, and see 71–85). Thus, for British travelers, 
                    Continental sites commemorating peace treaties could stir patriotism, evoking not only military pride but also the mercantile interests that underlay that patriotism.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">At the <span class="placeName-building-HOTELDEVILLEAIX">Hôtel de Ville</span> in <span class="placeName-AIXLACHAPELLE">Aix‐la‐Chapelle</span>,

                        The idea of a portrait collection commemorating the Congress was connected with a scheme by 
                        <span class="persName-KG4">George</span>, the Prince Regent (<span class="date-1762-1830">1762–1830</span>), and his circle to commission the fashionable portraitist, <span class="persName-TL">Thomas Lawrence</span> (<span class="date-1769-1830">1769–1830</span>), 
                        to paint the monarchs and major military heroes involved in the victory over <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span>—an ambitious undertaking that was finally 
                        realized in the decoration of the Waterloo Chamber at <span class="placeName-building-WINDSORCAS">Windsor Castle</span> to display the collection. 
                        The commission led <span class="persName-TL">Lawrence</span> to attend the Congress at <span class="placeName-AIXLACHAPELLE">Aix‐la‐Chapelle</span> in <span class="date-1818">1818</span>, 
                        so that he could take advantage of the gathering of monarchs and dignitaries and persuade them to sit for their portraits. For this purpose, he was assigned rooms of the 
                        <span class="title-HOTELDEVILLEAIX">Hôtel de Ville</span> for a studio. <span class="persName-TL">Lawrence</span> enlarged on the distinction thus conferred on a British artist: 
                        “Sent here by royal command, the magistrates of a royal city, in which for centuries the Emperor has been crowned, granted me the principal gallery of the <span class="placeName-building-HOTELDEVILLEAIX">Town House</span> 
                        for my painting‐room; and to this the three greatest monarchs in recent political importance, have condescended to come to be painted by me”

                        None of <span class="persName-TL">Lawrence</span>ʼs portraits for this commission would have remained at <span class="placeName-AIXLACHAPELLE">Aix‐la‐Chapelle</span>, unless the collection included mezzotints based on them; 
                        in fact, at his death, <span class="persName-TL">Lawrence</span> retained the portraits that would only later be assembled at <span class="placeName-building-WINDSORCAS">Windsor Castle</span>. Nonetheless, the episode 
                        at <span class="placeName-AIXLACHAPELLE">Aix‐la‐Chapelle</span>, along with <span class="persName-TL">Lawrence</span>ʼs further travels and commissions on the Continent, was influential in giving a boost 
                        to the reputation of English art in Europe—a reputation that reached a high‐water mark with the so‐called “English Salon” of <span class="date-1824">1824</span>, which included <span class="persName-TL">Lawrence</span>ʼs portraits along with 
                        <span class="persName-CONSTABLEARTIST">John Constable</span>ʼs (<span class="date-1776-1837">1776–1837</span>) landscapes. 
                        By <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, the loose “English manner” of painting was championed by the French Romantics, especially by <span class="persName-FVED">Eugène Delacroix</span> 
                        (<span class="date-1798-1863">1798–1863</span>), over the objections of the French neoclassicists

                    with a story of the emperorʼs burial that abridged the traditions about the interment and disinterment—unless the writer herself confused the legends. According to this version, 
                    the vault below the original octagonal domed structure was first opened by <span class="persName-FB1">Frederick Barbarossa I</span> (<span class="date-1125-1190">1125–90</span>)—an

                    while the stone chair was installed in the octagonal gallery to become the German coronation throne. As he relayed these legends, the sacristan recalled how he had helped 
                    attend <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span> and <span class="persName-JDB">Josephine</span> in their tour of the cathedral. Allowing <span class="persName-FMT">Mrs. Trollope</span> to ascend and seat herself on the throne, the sacristan told her how <span class="persName-JDB">Josephine</span> had 
                    likewise indulged in that honor, whereas <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span> reverently avoided touching any of these relics of the <span class="placeName-HOLYROMANEMPIRE">Holy Roman Empire</span> or stepping on the stone covering <span class="persName-CHARLEMAGNE">Charlemagne</span>ʼs tomb

                    following the title, “Last Judgment”, in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft, combined with his ambiguous use of punctuation, suggests that he may have been struggling with two lapses. 
                    One, as indicated by the name that, in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy, takes the place of the gap—“<span class="persName-MAA">Michael Angelo</span>”—<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> could not identify the name of the artist 
                    attributed to the “Last Judgment” picture. 
                    Two, as suggested by the ambiguous punctuation following “Last Judgment” and “I think”—points that appear to function as pause‐periods (see 
                    <a href="/notes/editorial_rationale_note#COMMA" target="_self">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology: Element, Attribute, and Value Usage—Commas, Periods, and Other Punctuation</a>), 
                    but that may indicate full‐stops—his expression of uncertainty, “I think”, may apply either to the missing artistʼs name or to the location of the work, 
                    whether in <span class="title-building-AACHENCATHEDRAL">the cathedral</span> or in the <span class="title-HOTELDEVILLEAIX">Hôtel de Ville</span>. 
                    In <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> resolved at least the first of the two ambiguities by supplying a name; and he appears to have attempted to resolve the second problem, 
                    the ambiguous modifier, by placing parentheses around the sentence: 
                    “(Last judgment, <span class="persName-MAA">Michael Angelo</span>, I think, in the <span class="placeName-HOTELDEVILLEAIX">Hotel de Ville</span>)”.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">This solution both agrees and disagrees with the diary of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs cousin,

                    not <span class="persName-MAA">Michelangelo</span>. Both accounts mention the bad light: because the family arrived at the <span class="title-HOTELDEVILLEAIX">Hôtel de Ville</span> 
                    toward the end of their day in <span class="placeName-AIXLACHAPELLE">Aix‐la‐Chapelle</span>, <span class="persName-MBR">Mary</span> found that it was “getting too dark to see”, 
                        and they especially “couldnʼt see” the “Last Judgment”

                        According to a guidebook published locally in <span class="placeName-AIXLACHAPELLE">Aix‐la‐Chapelle</span> around <span class="date-1830">1830</span>, 
                    the <span class="title-HOTELDEVILLEAIX">Hôtel de Ville</span>ʼs “sallon de lecteur de la bibliothèque” exhibited two “grands tableaux”, one a “jugement dernier”

                    However, the <span class="title-artwork-SPRANGERLASTJUDGMENT"><i>Last Judgment</i></span> currently recognized in the literature on <span class="persName-BSA">Spranger</span> 
                    is a copy—one scholar considers it an adaptation, “implanted . . . with [<span class="persName-BSA">Spranger</span>ʼs] own aesthetic values”—of a 
                    <span class="persName-ANGELICO">Fra Angelico</span> triptych, commissioned by <span class="persName-PIUSV">Pope Pius V</span> for his tomb. The provenance for this large work (46 by 58 inches), which appears 
                    well‐documented, excludes <span class="placeName-AIXLACHAPELLE">Aix‐la‐Chapelle</span>

                        Still, it is intriguing that the Ruskins may have seen a copy or reproduction of a work of Catholic art that, depending on the artist, could have represented such extremes of feeling.
                    (Engraved reproductions at least of <span class="persName-MAA">Michelangelo</span>ʼs <span class="title-artwork-MICHELANGELOLASTJUDGMENT"><i>Last Judgment</i></span> had been widely available
