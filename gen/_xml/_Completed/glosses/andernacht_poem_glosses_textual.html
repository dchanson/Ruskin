                    forming the <span class="title-poem-FRAGMENTS">“Fragments”</span>, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs choice 
                    was in keeping with his preference for published versions 
                    (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS4D1891" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS4D1891"><i>Poems</i></span> [4<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>]</a>,1:266–67;

                    (<span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> did not, however, follow this practice consistently in choice of copytext.) In the 
                    <a href="/notes/library_edition_note" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span></a>, the editors followed suit, reproducing the 
                    <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> version as main copytext 
                    (inclusing a minor correction of <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs transcription), and dropping the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>/<span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> version into a note.</div>

                        “First Sketch of ‘Andernach’”, should have been placed in square brackets, since the title is the editorsʼ invention. The title is also misleading, 
                        since a version cannot be deemed a “sketch” that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> so closely followed in fair‐copying from <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> to <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>, 
                        not anticipating that the poem would be revised and published as part of <span class="title-poem-JRFRAGMENTS">“Fragments”</span> in

                        do not follow for the main copytext). While <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs spelling carried over to the

                        <span class="title-poem-JRSTGOAR">“St. Goar”</span>. The American editor understood his task as recovering <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs 
                        poetry texts from the annuals and of course lacked access to manuscripts or the information needed to make a connection between <span class="title-poem-FRAGMENTS">“Fragments from a Metrical Journal”</span> and
