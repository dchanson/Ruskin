               <div class="p">The variant in the print versions may be owing to a faulty transcription or to a printerʼs error, or <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> may have made the change deliberately in order to improve sense, from his point of view. 
                        While the original parallel structure in the manuscript seems superior, with the prepositional phrases in lines 9 and 11 paired with their respective main clauses in lines 10 and 12, 
                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> perhaps recognized that it is geographically erroneous to state that the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> foams from both the <span class="geogName-RHAETIANALPS">Rhaetian</span> and the <span class="geogName-DINARICALPS">Dinaric</span> crests in the west, 
                        since the <span class="geogName-DINARICALPS">Dinaric Alps</span> lie in the east, across the <span class="geogName-ADRIATICSEA">Adriatic sea</span> (see contextual glosses), far from the course of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>. 
                        Thus, by changing the parallelism to a series of three consecutive prepositional phrases, each of them modifying the same main clause in line 12, 
                        <span class="persName-WCG">Collingwood</span> would have replaced the factual error with satisfactorily poetic sense, as if the spectator scans the horizon 
                        of the entire <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alpine</span> chain—.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">It is notable that, while the editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> rejected <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs alteration of line 7 (returning to the awkward but original “In all its aspect is as fair” 
                        in preference to <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs more elegant but invented “In all its aspects ʼtis as fair!”), they nonetheless silently retained his change in line 10 from “Foam” 
                        to “From”—perhaps an oversight, or perhaps an implicit acknowledgement of what seemed improved sense.</div>
