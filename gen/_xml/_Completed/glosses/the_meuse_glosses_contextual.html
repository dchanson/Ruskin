                    at least two poems by <a href="/notes/scott_walter_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span> (1771–1832)</a>. 
                    In one, <span class="title-poem-SCOTTMASSACREOFGLENCOE">“On the Massacre of Glencoe”</span> (<span class="date-1814">1814</span>), a minstrel names things 
                    that retain “lone security”, such as the “mist‐wreath” which “has the mountain‐crest”, 
                    as opposed to the slain and dispersed Highland victims of the <span class="placeName-GLENCOE">Glencoe</span> massacre, who were betrayed on account of their Jacobite loyalties 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#SCOTTWORKSCALEDONIAN" target="_self"><span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>, <span class="title-book-SCOTTWORKSCALEDONIAN"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 50:151). 
                    The other poem, <span class="title-poem-SCOTTDONRODERICK"><i>The Vision of <span class="persName-fictional-DRK">Don Roderick</span></i></span> (<span class="date-1811">1811</span>), 
                    may bear greater intertextual interest for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem than merely providing a source of poetic diction. 
                    <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span> composed his poem as a heroic ode in Spenserian stanzas, 
                    in support of relief to <span class="placeName-PORTUGAL">Portugal</span> during the <span class="date-1807-1814">Peninsular War</span>. 
                    In the poem, <span class="persName-fictional-DRK">Don Roderick</span>, “the last Gothic King of Spain”, descends into an enchanted “ancient vault, . . . 
                    the opening of which had been denounced as fatal to the Spanish Monarchy”. Here, the king witnesses a vision of three future periods of crisis in the <span class="geogName-IBERIA">Iberian peninsula</span>, 
                    the last involving the “unparalleled treachery of <span class="persName-NBE">Bonaparte</span>”. In <span class="persName-fictional-DRK">Don Roderick</span>ʼs vision, 
                    the attempted usurpation by the French is thwarted by “the arrival of the British succours”. As the vision dissipates, 
                    the narrator looks forward to a triumphant conclusion: “though the Vault of Destiny be gone, / 
                    King, prelate, all the phantasms of my brain, / Melted away like mist‐wreaths in the sun, / Yet grant for faith, for valour, 
                    and for <span class="placeName-SPAIN">Spain</span>, / One note of pride and fire, a patriotʼs parting strain!”

                    Line 10 of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem may allude to such a vision of history, the “fairy vision of a dream”, 
                    since the narrator has departed from the <span class="placeName-WATERLOO">Field of Waterloo</span>, the scene of “British succours”, 
                    in the preceding section of the “Account”<span class="title-composite-JRBRUSSELSCOMP"></span>, “Brussels”, and now crosses the <span class="geogName-MEUSE">Meuse River</span> to enter a <span class="geogName-EUROPE">Europe</span>

                    The approach to <span class="placeName-NAMUR">Namur</span> is magnificent. The town lies in a basin at the juncture of the

                    the appearance of a succession of ruined castles, that are scarcely to be distinguished by the eye from those ancient fabrics, which are actually existing, 
                    and which may occasionally be seen peeping through the dense woods, or perched on the very pinnacle of some rocky eminence. In some places, either by the wasting away 
                    of the earth or loose materials, or by the working of the quarrymen, huge masses of naked rock are seen as if suspended in the air, or supported on so small a base,

                    “greatly strengthened since the war, under the inspection of the <span class="persName-AWW">Duke of Wellington</span>, and partly at the expense of <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Great Britain</span>”. 
                    <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> added, however, that the works had been less kept up recently, owing to “the <span class="date-1830-08-25-1831-07-14">revolution of 1830</span>”

                    backward glance at the “rich dome of the cathedral” may refer to the late‐baroque dome of the <span class="placeName-building-STAUBIN">cathedral of St. Aubin</span>, 
                    a relatively modern church that, <span class="persName-SJB">Barrow</span> notes, had suffered the “bad usage of the French soldiery, who converted it into a barrack and a hospital”,
                    but that was now “kept in a state of good repair and perfect neatness”. The other principal church was the baroque edifice of the Jesuit church, 
                    <span class="placeName-building-STLOUP">St. Loup</span>, which was not domed, but which was celebrated for its carved‐stone interior vault—as

                    <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> singles out the manufacture of firearms and of machinery, iron foundaries, saddlery and coarse cloth production.
