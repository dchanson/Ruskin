                  <div class="p"><b>“then may clouds . . . rain may pour”—</b>Perhaps because he failed to understand the gist of <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs figurative language, 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> substitutes a description of stormy weather for the originalʼs “imprisonʼd storms” that the steam engine has crowded inside a bellows, 
                    its “close cells of ribbed oak” confining the “struggling wind” until emitting the air with a “roar” through its “brazen nostrils” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#DARWINWORKS" target="_self">Darwin, <i>Poetical Works</i></a>, 1:32). Or perhaps <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                    understood <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs figurative language but decided 
                    to unpack the figure into its literal components, saving <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs unnamed bellows for later in his own poem, 
                    “The moving bellows that are made to roar” (line 21).</div></span><br><br>

                  <div class="p"><b>“the grinding stones . . . cotton fibres twirl”—</b><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> adopts <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs 
                    example of a benefit of steam, the mechanized mill, but he ignores <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs moralizing on the “Feast without blood!” that is provided by the increased production of grain “to nourish human-kind.” 
                    In a note, <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span> expounds on the superiority of a vegetable diet in an “economy of nature” that contributes to the “sum of general happiness” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#DARWINWORKS" target="_self">Darwin, <i>Poetical Works</i></a>, 1:32–33). In place of this topic, 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> takes up <span class="persName-SRA">Richard Awkright</span>ʼs (1732–92) cotton spinning machinery, 
                    which <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span> celebrates in a different part of <span class="title-poem-"><i>The Botanic Garden</i></span>, 
                    in a section of <span class="title-poem-"><i>The Loves of the Plants</i></span> (<span class="date-1789">1789</span>)

                    <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs account of <span class="persName-MB">Matthew Boulton</span>ʼs coining machine
