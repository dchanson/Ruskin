                    <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span> [<span class="date-1903">1903</span>])—</b>On 
                    <span class="date-1833-06-14">14 June 1833</span> at six oʼclock in the morning, the Ruskins left <span class="placeName-CHIAVENNA">Chiavenna</span> 
                    for their first excursion on the Italian lakes. The little bay, which was the point of embarkation, refers, not to <span class="geogName-">Lago di Como</span> 
                    which is the main subject of the poem, but to what <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span> describes as “the lake of Chiavenna which joins that of Como”—that is, 
                    <span class="geogName-LAGOMEZZOLA">Lago Mezzola</span>. <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span>ʼs guidebook names the lake 
                    “<span class="geogName-LAGOMEZZOLA">Lago Mezzola</span>, called also <span class="geogName-LAGORIVA">Lago di Riva</span>”, 
                    and <span class="persName-MSA">Starke</span>ʼs guidebook calls it simply “<span class="geogName-LAGORIVA">La Riva</span>” 
                    (i.e., <i>lakeshore</i>), a term <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> also uses. Describing the journey

               <div class="p">The Ruskinsʼ carriage having been loaded on a large boat bound for the town of <span class="placeName-COMO">Como</span>, the family took a passenger boat, 
                        rowing down <span class="geogName-LAGOMEZZOLA">Lago Mezzola</span>, “none but Italians with us . . . , <span class="persName-SALVADOR">Salvatore</span> having gone with the carriage”. 
                    At <span class="placeName-DOMASO">Domaso</span>, a village at the north end of <span class="geogName-LAKECOMO">Lake Como</span>, 
                        the family transferred to a steamer to carry them down the length of the lake, <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> 
                        enthusing about the scenery presenting a different view every moment. By four oʼclock in the afternoon, they reached <span class="placeName-CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</span>, 
                    a town on the west bank at the top of the western “leg” of the lake, opposite <span class="placeName-BELLAGIO">Bellagio</span>; 
                    and since the steamer did not stop there, they took a small boat to <span class="placeName-CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</span>, which they made their base for the weekend 
                    before traveling on to <span class="placeName-COMO">Como</span> at the start of the next week 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFT48" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson</span>, <span class="date-1833">1833</span></a>, 42).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">These movements are in keeping with the recommendations of the guidebooks. <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> cautioned travelers against pausing on their journey through these lakes, 
                        particularly “the lower valley of the <span class="geogName-MERA">Meira</span>” (or <span class="geogName-MERA">Mera River</span>), 
                        which connects “<span class="placeName-CHIAVENNA">Chiavenna</span> to the <span class="geogName-LAGORIVA">Lago di Riva</span>” 
                        (i.e., <span class="geogName-LAGOMEZZOLA">Lago di Mezzola</span>) and then continues onward to connect the latter to <span class="geogName-">Lago di Como</span>. 
                        Travelers should push onward, <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> urged, until reaching either <span class="placeName-BELLAGIO">Bellagio</span> on the promontory 
                        dividing the lower legs of <span class="persName-">Lago di Como</span>, or <span class="placeName-CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</span> on the west shore, 
                        or <span class="placeName-VARENNA">Varenna</span> on the east shore. Until travelers reached those points south, <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> 
                        sternly lectured, they risked contracting malaria: “the stranger who neglects this warning may pay for his temerity by a fever” since 
                        “stopping for the night [anywhere] near the embouchure of a river, where it empties itself into a lake”, exposes the traveler to “the morasses 
                        and flat land created by the deposits of the river”, which “are the hotbeds of malaria, and inevitably teem with disease” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838" target="_self"><span class="title-book-MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><i>Hand‐book for Travellers in Switzerland</i></span></a>, 212, xxiii). 
                        <span class="persName-MSA">Mariana Starke</span>, in her guidebook, confirms a lesser detail in <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>ʼs account—that a separate boat 
                        conveyed the familyʼs carriage from <span class="geogName-LAGORIVA">Lago di Riva</span> to <span class="placeName-COMO">Como</span>, 
                        while the family took a small passenger boat, until joining a steamer at <span class="placeName-DOMASO">Domaso</span>. <span class="persName-MSA">Starke</span> mentions 
                        that the steamer concession at <span class="placeName-DOMASO">Domaso</span> was “managed by Englishmen” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#STARKETRAVELSINEUROPE" target="_self"><span class="persName-MSA">Starke</span>, <span class="title-book-STARKETRAVELSINEUROPE"><i>Travels in Europe</i></span></a>, 568).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Note that, in the poem, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> does not mention the steamer, describing only the splash of oars in the water 
                        of <span class="geogName-">Lago di Como</span>. By confining his description to the gentle sounds of the excursion on the smaller passenger boats, 
                        he was erasing such signs of modernity as the noisy steam packet for the sake of maintaining the picturesque, 
                        just as in the poem <span class="title-composite-JRCALAISCOMP">“Calais”</span> he replaces 
                        the “french steamer” on the horizon with the picturesque, lugubrious movements nearby of French fishing boats.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">As detailed in the textual notes to this poem, <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> omitted the first ten lines of the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft 
                        from the version of the poem in <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i> (1891)</span>, an omission that effectively erases the prelude 
                        describing <span class="geogName-LAGOMEZZOLA">Lago Mezzola</span> and focuses the poem on <span class="geogName-LAKECOMO">Lago di Como</span>. With this omission, 
                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> blunted the strategy of the poem, which contrasts the severe character of <span class="geogName-LAGOMEZZOLA">Lago Mezzola</span> 
                        with the blue breadth of <span class="geogName-LAKECOMO">Como</span> and its richly vegetated banks.</div></span><br><br>

               <div class="p"><b>“Beneath the precipices grey”

                    <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span> [<span class="date-1903">1903</span>])—</b>Here as well as in lines 18-19, 
                    where the narrator mentions having “launched from below / The shade of the tall cliffs”, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                    comments on the enclosed feeling of <span class="geogName-LAGOMEZZOLA">Lago Mezzola</span>, compared with the breadth of <span class="geogName-">Lago di Como</span>, 
                    which "rolled his breast of flame” (line 20). Mary considered the smaller lake "rather gloomy" "with the mountains coming down close to the water" 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFT48" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson</span>, <span class="date-1833">1833</span></a>, 42). 
                    In <span class="date-1833">1833</span>, the mountainous shore of <span class="geogName-LAGOMEZZOLA">Lago Mezzola</span> perhaps appeared even more dramatic, 
                    since the perimeter of the lake was not as yet recessed by a road, which <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> says was opened in <span class="date-1835">1835</span>. 
                    Even then, <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> comments on the “naked and savage mountains around [which] have a very peculiar outline. 
                    Their sides are furrowed with ravines, down which furious torrents precipitate themselves . . . , strewing the margin of the lake with wreck” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838" target="_self"><span class="title-book-MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><i>Hand‐book for Travellers in Switzerland</i></span></a>, 212). 
                    These torrents must be what <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> means by a “thousand mountain rills”.</div></span><br><br>
