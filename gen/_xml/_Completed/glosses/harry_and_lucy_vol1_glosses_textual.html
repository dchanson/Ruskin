                    Since the tear line fits the remaining stub, the leaf evidently was not moved here from elsewhere.

                    the plate numbering suggests that the missing leaf contained a plate, numbered plate 4. An alternative explanation is suggested

                    and not an afterthought extending the sentence, it serves as evidence that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> fair‐copied the text in <span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span> from a draft (not extant). Only an omission

                    Like the previoius misnumbering of “80” for what should have been “60”, the error affects the page‐numbering sequence 
                    for the remainder of the manuscript. The number “9” to the left of “88” perhaps reveals <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs

                    not in lettering style or medium, but in control: from here to the end of the chapter, the letters seem smaller and the strokes more assured. 
                    The combined evidence may indicate that some time elapsed between Ruskin's writing about the new arrival at the hotel and inventing his conclusion.</div></span><br><br>
