                    gave the title <span class="title-poem-JRLAGOMAGGIORE">“Lago Maggiore”</span> to this poem, which is untitled in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft. <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> does not justify this choice in his notes on the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNT">“Account”</span>; 
                    but while no definitive internal evidence sanctions this identification, one can guess that <span class="geogName-MAGGIORE">Lago Maggiore</span> was suggested to the editor by elements of the poetʼs description,

In <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, the eight lines on 78v are enclosed in parentheses—marks 
                    which were probably made by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> (the ink is the same color as for the text), and which are most readily explained as separating the lines from the draft 
                    sections of prose essay for "Heidelberg" that immediately precede and follow them (parts 2 and 3, respectively, of the essay draft, 
                    <a href="/witnesses/heidelberg_prose2_msviii" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-JRHEIDELBERGPROSE2_MSVIII">“Cont. Heidelberg” [“The castle of Heidelberg is exceeding desolate”]</span></a>, and 
                    <a href="/witnesses/heidelberg_prose3_msviii" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-JRHEIDELBERGPROSE3_MSVIII">“All has yielded to it from time immemorial”</span></a>). 
                    Otherwise, no meta‐discursive indication in the manuscript connects the two line groups.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs choice was probably aesthetic but also reasoned. Both the lines on 78v and the poem composed earlier on 64v–65r are fragments—the 
                        eight lines not only lacking context but also unrhymed in the final couplet, and the earlier poem ending apparently in mid‐sentence. Both sets of lines also 
                        describe sailing on a deeply blue lake as if in a liminal space between water, sky, and mountain glacier. Appending the eight lines to the earlier poem even creates an appearance of closure, 
                        with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs final line on 78v, “And the moon she sits in her majesty”, 
                        causing the combined lines to circle back to the image of the moon in the opening lines: “It was an eve of summer, mild, / As ever looked the pale moon through”. 
                        Still the seam shows at the join, the unfinished sentence in the earlier poem calling for a clause starting with “that” (“Yet was there such a softness shed . . .”), 
                        not the "so" starting the second fragment; and if the final lines of the earier poem are read as an exclamatory appreciation (“Yet was there <i>such</i> a softness shed . . .”), 
                        no further clause is required at all. <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs choice to combine these two sets of lines is justifiable, but remains speculative; 
                        and one must question why in this instance he departed from his editorial principle of omitting publication of fragmentary writing (see 
                        <a href="/notes/poems_1891_note" target="_self"><i>Poems</i> [1891]</a>).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">In the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>, the editors reprinted <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs text, including the interpolated lines, likewise without comment. They did compare the added lines 
                        with the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> witness, however, as indicated by their correcting <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs version of the line, “Another heaven beneath our feet”, to 
                        “Another heaven ʼneath our feet”, preserving <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs contraction as found in the manuscript witness.</div>
