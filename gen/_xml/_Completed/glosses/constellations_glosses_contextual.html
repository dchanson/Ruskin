                        and he also appears to <span class="persName-fictional-ULYSSES">Odysseus</span> among the dead in the underworld (bk. 11).
                        In mythology, <span class="persName-fictional-ORION">Orion</span> is a great hunter. He “is represented on the globe by the figure of a man with a sword in his belt, 
                        a club in his right hand, and the skin of a lion in his left; he is said by some authors to be the son of <span class="persName-fictional-NEPTUNE">Neptune</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-EURYALE">Euryale</span>, a famous huntress;

               <div class="p"><span class="persName-IRIDPATH">Ridpath</span> explains that <span class="persName-MHELL">Hell</span> originally created two constellations commemorating <span class="persName-WHERSCHEL">Herschel</span> telescopes, which were reduced to one by <span class="persName-JBODE">Johann Bode</span> in <span class="date-1801">1801</span>. 
                        <span class="persName-JCBARENTINE">Barentine</span> adds that <span class="persName-JBODE">Bode</span>ʼs adoption was decisive, few atlases having previously adopted Hellʼs inventions. 
                        <span class="persName-JBODE">Bode</span>ʼs <span class="title-book-BODEURANOGRAPHIA"><i>Uranographia</i></span> must therefore have influenced <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs unidentified source for him to have named the constellation at all—an 
                        influence that is confirmed by similar clues noted throughout these glosses. A caveat is <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs omission of <span class="persName-WHERSCHEL">Herschel</span>ʼs name, 
                        which opens the possibility that he intended, not <span class="name--TELESCOPIUM-HERSCHELII">Telescopium Herschelii</span>, 
                        but <span class="name--TELESCOPIUM">Telescopium (Telescope)</span>—a small constellation in the southern hemisphere. 
                        This Telescope, which remains officially recognized today, was created by the French astronomer, 
                        <span class="persName-NLL">Nicolas‐Louis de Lacaille</span> (<span class="date-1713-1762">1713–62</span>). 
                        While <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs intention cannot be proved, 
                        it is reasonable to assume that he meant to celebrate a constellation honoring a famous British astronomer, 
                        and not an invention by a French astronomer, which lies too deep in the southern hemisphere even to be viewable from <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>

                        who depicted it as a fox with a goose captured in its jaws. The haplessness of the bird may account for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs epithet of “stupid”,
                        but by dividing the constellation in two <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> also avoids drawing attention to the gooseʼs fate.
                        A precedent for separating the fox from the goose extends back to <span class="persName-JHEVELIUS">Hevelius</span> himself,
                        who named the constellation both as a single entity, <span class="name--VULPECULAETANSER">Vulpecula <i>cum</i> Anser</span>,

                        Since, in other evidence, <span class="persName-JBODE">Bode</span> appears as a terminus a quo for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs likely sources of information about the constellations 
                        (see <a href="#MUSCAGLOSS"><span class="name--MUSCABOREALIS">Musca Borealis [the Northern Fly]</span></a>),

                        According to a legend in <span class="persName-ERATOSTHENES">Eratosthenes</span> similar to a story associated with Ursa Minor, the constellation “represents <span class="persName-fictional-ARCAS">Arcas</span>,

                        puts in doubt what constellation he intended. The name “swallow” appears in the first draft,

                        and after <span class="name--INDUS">“Indus, the Indian”</span>, although the ordering of constellation names in <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs columns may not be significant

                        According to <span class="persName-RHA">Richard Hinckley Allen</span>, the constellation <span class="name--APUS"><i>Apus</i></span> 
                        may have acquired the name the <i>Swallow</i> by way of the common English name for <span class="persName-CLINNAEUS">Linnaeus</span>ʼs species name, <i>Hirundo apus</i>, 
                        which is also applied to the swift‐birds associated with the approach of summer 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#ALLENSTARNAMES" target="_self"><span class="persName-RHA">Allen</span>, <span class="title-book-ALLENSTARNAMES"><i>Star Names</i></span></a>, 44). 
                        As a gloss for <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs listing, however, <span class="persName-RHA">Allen</span>ʼs explanation 
                        is contradicted by her <i>separate</i> listing of <span class="name--APUS">“Apus, or Avis Indica, the Bird of Paradise”</span>, which appears 
                        at the end of the list, following <span class="name--TRIANGULUMAUSTRALE">“Triangulum Australe, the Southern Triangle”</span>. 
                        If <span class="persName-RHA">Allen</span> is correct that <i>Hirundo apus</i> became confused with the constellation name, <span class="name--APUS">Apus</span>, 
                        it is understandable that <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span> would nonetheless have decided that a constellation named after the common English <span class="name--SWALLOW">swallow</span> 
                        could be the same constellation known as <span class="name--APUS">Apus</span> or <span class="name--APUS"><i>Apus Indica</i></span> 
                        or (in English) <span class="name--APUS"><i>Bird of Paradise</i></span> 
                        (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS" target="_self"><span class="persName-AJ">Jamieson</span>, <span class="title-lesson-JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><i>Celestial Atlas</i></span></a>, 63, pl. 28). 
                        A probable conclusion, then, is that <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span> doubled the same constellation under two different names, 
                        and that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, insofar as he understood what he meant at all, was pointing to <span class="name--APUS"><i>Apus</i></span> in the southern hemisphere.</div>

                        Intentionally or not, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs choice of the epithet “keen‐eyed” is pertinent

                        At a time when astronomy was becoming defined by its optical instruments, <span class="persName-JHEVELIUS">Hevelius</span> persisted in relying on his unassisted eyesight.

               <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs revision of <span class="name--LYNX">Lynx</span>ʼs epithet from “furious” to “keeneyed” may have been influenced by the fable, 
                            <span class="title-story-AESOPLYNXANDMOLE">“The Lynx and the Mole”</span>, from <span class="persName-WGODWIN">William Godwin</span>ʼs <span class="title-book-GODWINFABLES"><i>Fables Ancient and Modern</i></span>. 
                        The tale begins by listing several attributes associated with the lynx, both natural and fabulous, 
                        but “what is most remarkable about him is his sight. He discovers objects at a greater distance than any other animal in the world. 
                        The ancients said, he could see through stone walls”. In the tale, a lynx belittles a mole for its weak vision, 
                        boasting “thou must needs burst with envy and rage against the partiality of nature, which has assigned thee such a wretched existence”. 
                        The mole answers: “If nature has denied me some organs and beauties which you possess, 
                        she has endowed me with what is better than both, a cheerful temper, enabling me to support my obscure existence, 
                        without misery or murmuring”. While contentment with oneʼs lot seems the moral of the tale, 
                        <span class="persName-WGODWIN">Godwin</span> allows the mole to triumph over the lynx: “if you surpass me in some of the senses”, 
                        the mole points out to the lynx, “I am equally superior to you in others”—specifically, 
                        his sharp hearing, which enables the mole to detect the advance of a hunter, unnoticed by the lynx. 
                        Caught by surprise, the lynx is mortally wounded by the hunterʼs javelin; and as the mole listens to the “lynxʼs expiring agony”, 
                        the narrator swerves the mole away from schadenfreude and back to complacency: he 
                        “felt more than ever thankful to Providence, for having blessed him with a mind not to repine at his station”

                        In <span class="persName-WGODWIN">Godwin</span>ʼs version, moreover, the story takes on what <span class="persName-PCLEMIT">Pamela Clemit</span> characterizes as <span class="persName-WGODWIN">Godwin</span>ʼs “egalitarian spin” on <span class="persName-AESOP">Aesop</span>ʼs fables. 
                        Moreover, in <span class="persName-WGODWIN">Godwin</span>ʼs conversational narrative style, unlike in <span class="persName-SCROXALL">Croxall</span>ʼs rigid lecturing, 
                        the “moral is drawn not through a traditional application” but is conveyed “through action and dialogue”

               <div class="p">Thus, in <span class="persName-SCROXALL">Croxall</span>ʼs “application” of <span class="title-story-AESOPLIONANDMOUSE">“The Lion and Mouse”</span>, the fable is interpreted as upholding a traditional social hierarchy, 
                        reminding “us” along with the lion that, “as the lowest People in Life may, upon Occasion, have it in their Power either to serve or hurt us”, 
                        such circumstances as befell the lion teach us “our Duty, in Point of common Interest, to behave ourselves with Good‐nature and Lenity towards all with whom we have to do”, 
                        ensuring that a low person may “not only . . . repay, but even . . . exceed, the Obligation due to his Benefactor” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#CROXALLAESOP" target="_self"><span class="title-book-CROXALLAESOP"><i>Fables of Aesop and Others</i></span>, trans. <span class="persName-SCROXALL">Croxall</span></a>, 57). 
                        In contrast, <span class="persName-WGODWIN">Godwin</span>ʼs version contains no formal application reversing the role of the lion from victim to “Benefactor” 
                        whose “Generosity” consists in dispensing noblesse oblige. Instead, the lion “is said to be very generous” by nature; 
                        for although he is “so formed that he must have meat to eat, . . . he never kills any creature for sport or cruelty”. 
                        When the mouse inadvertently disturbs the lion, the roused beast relents, not because he calculates leniency as a duty “in point of common Interest”, 
                        but because his nature is sympathic rather than cruel: “he could not find it in his heart to hurt such a poor little fellow”. 
                        Thus, when the lion is caught in a net—a predicament that arises, not in the course of timeless, mythic circumstances, 
                        but in the specific context of modern <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>, when “some sailors”, to curry favor, “wanted to catch a lion 
                        for <span class="persName-KG3">king George</span>, to be put into the <span class="placeName-building-TOWEROFLONDON">Tower of London</span>”—the lion feels what the mouse had experienced. 
                        Unlike <span class="persName-SCROXALL">Croxall</span>ʼs kingly beast, <span class="persName-WGODWIN">Godwin</span>ʼs lion is admitted to be “full as much frightened as the mouse had been the other day”, 
                        so that his generosity arises from fellow feeling rather than noblesse oblige

                        Writing on the constellation <span class="name--ARIES">Aries</span>, <span class="persName-JGREEN">Green</span> is skeptical of “those who are desirous of drawing from every source an argument

                        evangelicals—especially Scottish evangelicals, like <span class="persName-TCHALMERS">Chalmers</span>—were not receptive to a natural theology in the optimistic style

                        they&nbsp;maintained&nbsp;“a&nbsp;scriptural&nbsp;and&nbsp;soteriological&nbsp;emphasis&nbsp;distinct&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;largely&nbsp;ethical&nbsp;emphasis”&nbsp;of Paleyan natural theology, 
                        with its evidences of a <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">Creator</span> conceived as a benevolent watchmaker. 
                        <span class="persName-TCHALMERS">Chalmers</span> himself arrived at this emphasis following a transformative conversion experience, 
                        which resulted in an essay widely disseminated in <span class="date-1814">1814</span> as 
                        <span class="title-essay-CHALMERSEVIDENCE"><i>Evidence and Authority of the Christian Revelation</i></span>—the text mentioned by <span class="persName-JGREEN">Green</span> as his lodestar. 
                        In it, <span class="persName-TCHALMERS">Chalmers</span> pursues an inductive Baconian&nbsp;“science&nbsp;of&nbsp;theology&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;based&nbsp;strictly&nbsp;on&nbsp;historical&nbsp;evidence.&nbsp;

                        By comparison, <span class="persName-TCHALMERS">Chalmers</span> considered a Paleyan natural theology that&nbsp;judged&nbsp;“the&nbsp;truth&nbsp;of&nbsp;Christianity&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;reasonableness&nbsp;of&nbsp;its&nbsp;doctrines,&nbsp;

                        as combining the frame of a camel with the skin of a leopard—hence the name, <i>camelopardalis</i>. 
                        Since sightings of the animal by Europeans remained rare, <span class="persName-PLINYELDER">Pliny</span>ʼs description influenced illustrators as late as

                    and included among the twelve constellations that <span class="persName-PPLANCIUS">Plancius</span> devised in <span class="date-1598">1598</span>, based on observations by his fellow Dutchmen,

               <div class="p">The course of these confusions matters since clues may emerge that point to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs source of information about all the constellations. His poem identifies <span class="name--MUSCABOREALIS">“the little fly”</span> 
                        at line 34 and <span class="name--MUSCAAUSTRALIS">“the armed bee”</span> at line 48. Presumably, therefore, his source distinguished between the northern and the southern constellations, naming one <span class="name--MUSCAAUSTRALIS">Musca, or the Fly</span>, and the other <span class="name--MUSCAAUSTRALIS">Apis, or the Bee</span>. 
                        This combination suggests a source traceable to <span class="persName-JBODE">Bode</span>ʼs <span class="title-book-BODEURANOGRAPHIA"><i>Uranographia</i></span> or a derivative, 
                       thus placing <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs “little fly” in the north and his “armed bee” in the south. 
                       While these identifications cannot be confirmed with certainty, given <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs caveat noted in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> fair copy of the poem, 
                    that “[t]hese constellations though they are next in this poetry are not next in the sky”, nonetheless the <span class="name--MUSCABOREALIS">Fly</span> is said to be

                        and <span class="name--ARIES">Aries</span> (line 36). <span class="name--MUSCABOREALIS">Musca Borealis</span> was not directly “next to” <span class="name--CAMELOPARDALIS">Camelopardalis</span> or <span class="name--OPHIUCHUS">Ophiuchus</span> in any correct view of the constellations, 
                       yet the northern hemisphere is strongly suggested by this sequence of names—especially the nearby mention of <span class="name--ARIES">Aries</span>—thus clinching the identification of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs Fly with the northern <span class="name--MUSCABOREALIS">Musca Borealis</span>.</div>

               <div class="p">While <span class="persName-AJ">Jamieson</span> and his imitators neglected the illustration of the southern constellation, <span class="persName-AJ">Jamieson</span> did give <span class="name--MUSCAAUSTRALIS">Apis</span> its due in the text, 
                        as the very last of his prose description of the constellations. Identifying the asterism as <span class="name--MUSCAAUSTRLIS">“Musca Australis, the Southern Fly, or Bee”</span>, 
                        he bestows a royal coloring on the creature, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would have appreciated, given his favoring of constellations with monarchical associations—<a href="#CHARLESSHEARTGLOSS"><span class="name--CHARLESSHEART">Cor Caroli (Charlesʼs Heart)</span></a> in the north,

                        as well on account of the natural qualities of this most extraordinary insect, as on account of its being the old hieroglyphic of royalty. Of the insentient part of animated nature, 
                        the <span class="name--MUSCAAUSTRALIS">Bee</span> is prince and chief for foresight, ingenuity, industry, and fidelity: it was thence the fittest symbol of a good king”

               <div class="p">Whereas <span class="persName-AJ">Jamieson</span> lent an iconography of royal virtue to the <span class="name--MUSCAAUSTRALIS">Southern Bee</span>, the iconographic traditions surrounding <span class="name--MUSCABOREALIS">Musca Borealis</span>, or the Northern Fly, 
                        are darker and more bizarre. In one, the <span class="name--MUSCABOREALIS">Northern Fly or Bee</span> is connected with the “swarm of bees and honey” 
                        that collected “in the carcass of the lion” that <span class="persName-scriptural-SAMSON">Samson</span> killed with his bare hands 
                        when traveling to the Philistine woman he desired for his wife (<span class="title-scripture-JUDGES">Judg. 14:8</span>; see <a href="/notes/bibliography#BARENTINELOSTCONSTELLATIONS" target="_self"><span class="persName-JCBARENTINE">Barentine</span>, <span class="title-book-BARENTINELOSTCONSTELLATIONS"><i>Lost Constellations</i></span></a>, 245). 
                        According to <span class="persName-TS">Thomas Scott</span>ʼs annotations to this episode in <span class="title-scripture-JUDGES">Judges</span>, <span class="persName-scriptural-SAMSON">Samson</span> is a type of “<span class="persName-scriptural-JESUSCHRIST">Jesus Christ</span>, 
                        ere he entered upon his public ministry, and on the cross before his ascension”, when he “overcame ‘the devil, 
                        that roaring lion, which walketh about seeking whom he may devour’”. From the honey in the lion carcass, 
                        <span class="persName-scriptural-SAMSON">Samson</span> draws a riddle to challenge the Philistines: “Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness” 
                        (<span class="title-scripture-JUDGES">Judg.</span> 14:14). Typologically, <span class="persName-TS">Scott</span> reads the riddle as signifying the <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">Lord</span>ʼs providentially turning evil to good: 
                        “The victory, which <span class="persName-scriptural-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span> obtained over <span class="persName-scriptural-SATAN">Satan</span>, by means of his agonies and death . . . ; 
                        the glory that redounded to the <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">Father</span>; and the spiritual advantages thence accruing to his people”. 
                        <span class="persName-TS">Scott</span> goes on to elaborate these spiritual advantages at length 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#SCOTTBIBLE" target="_self"><span class="title-scripture-SCOTTBIBLE">Holy Bible</span>, ed. <span class="persName-TS">Scott</span></a>, 1:732, 733).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">In another Christian iconographic connection, the <span class="name--MUSCABOREALIS">Northern Fly</span> was viewed as an emblem of <span class="persName-scriptural-BEELZEBUB">Beelzebub</span>, Lord of the flies (e.g., <span class="title-scripture-MATTHEW">Matt. 12:24</span>, <span class="title-scripture-LUKE">Luke 11:15</span>; 
                        see <a href="/notes/bibliography#BARENTINELOSTCONSTELLATIONS" target="_self"><span class="persName-JCBARENTINE">Barentine</span>, <span class="title-book-BARENTINELOSTCONSTELLATIONS"><i>Lost Constellations</i></span></a>, 245–48). When <span class="persName-scriptural-JESUSCHRIST">Jesus</span> performed the miracle of causing the blind to see, and the dumb to speak,
                        the Pharisees attributed his power of “cast[ing] out devils” to the aid of “<span class="persName-scriptural-BEELZEBUB">Beelzebub</span>, the prince of devils” (<span class="title-scripture-MATTHEW">Matt. 12:24</span>)—the name <span class="persName-scriptural-BEELZEBUB"><i>Beelzebub</i></span> 
                        signifying <i>Lord of a fly</i> or <i>Lord of a dunghill</i>. <span class="persName-scriptural-JESUS">Jesus</span> refutes the claim by arguing: 
                        “If <span class="persName-scriptural-SATAN">Satan</span> cast out <span class="persName-scriptural-SATAN">Satan</span>, he is divided against himself: how shall then his kingdom stand” (<span class="title-scripture-MATTHEW">Matt. 12:26</span>). 
                        <span class="persName-TS">Scott</span> interprets the parable similarly to <span class="persName-scriptural-SAMSON">Samson</span>ʼs riddle, as referring to the self‐thwarting of evil: 
                        “If <span class="persName-scriptural-SATAN">Satan</span> aided <span class="persName-scriptural-JESUSCHRIST">Jesus</span> in casting out devils, the infernal kingdom was divided against itself; and how then could it any longer subsist?”

                        who is credited with inventing the chariot. <span class="persName-JGREEN">Green</span> quotes from <span class="persName-PVM">Virgil</span>ʼs <span class="title-poem-VIRGILGEORGICS"><i>Georgics</i></span>:

                        “Bold <span class="persName-fictional-ERICHTHONIUS">Ericthonius</span> was the first who joinʼd / Four horses for the rapid race designʼd”

                        Perhaps by association with the latter aspect of the legend, “[s]ome suppose <span class="name--AURIGA">Auriga</span> to be the same with <span class="persName-fictional-PHAETHON">Phaëton</span>,

                        As <span class="persName-IRIDPATH">Ridpath</span> goes on to explain, thanks to <span class="persName-fictional-MYRTILUS">Myrtilus</span>ʼs horse training, 
                        his king was able to fend off suitors to his beautiful daughter, <span class="persName-fictional-HIPPODAMIA">Hippodamia</span>, 
                        by challenging them to a race in which the penalty was death. After a dozen challengers had met their death, another suitor won <span class="persName-fictional-HIPPODAMIA">Hippodamia</span>ʼs love, 
                        leading her to persuade <span class="persName-fictional-MYRTILUS">Myrtilus</span> to tamper with the kingʼs chariot. <span class="persName-fictional-MYRTILUS">Myrtilus</span> agreed since he was in love with the girl himself, 
                        and so the king was killed in the race instead of the suitor. For his pains, <span class="persName-fictional-MYRTILUS">Myrtilus</span> was murdered by the jealous suitor. 
                        This fate explains his sad lack of a chariot in the sky

                        and those visual elements were carried into modern representations 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RIDPATHSTARTALES" target="_self"><span class="persName-IRIDPATH">Ridpath</span>, <span class="title-book-RIDPATHSTARTALES"><i>Star Tales</i></span></a>, 47). 
                        It seems not just the depiction of flames, however, that moved <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, in <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span>, 
                        to insert the epithet <span class="name--ARA">“gods fire”</span> into the line as originally drafted in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>; rather, 
                        his phrase suggests that he was forestalling association with the pagan rites involved in the myths originally connected with the <span class="name--ARA">Altar</span>. 
                        The phrase “godʼs fire” imposes a Christian typology on the altar flames, referring, e.g., to <span class="title-scripture-LEVITICUS">Leviticus</span> 6:12–13: 
                        “And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it, it shall not be put out: 
                        and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace‐offerings. 
                        The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar: it shall never go out”. In a commentary on the passage in his popular annotated <span class="title-scripture-SCOTTBIBLE">Bible</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-TSCOTT">Thomas Scott</span> (<span class="date-1747-1821">1747–1821</span>) reads the Levitical rites as a type of the permanence of <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">God</span>ʼs justice and <span class="persName-scriptural-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span>ʼs redemption:
                        just as “the fire on the altar was kindled from heaven”, <span class="persName-TSCOTT">Scott</span> explains, “and it must not be suffered to go out” 
                        causing it to “be replaced by ordinary fire”, so “this fire was an intended type of the eternal avenging justice of <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">God</span>, 
                        and the perpetual efficacy of <span class="persName-scriptural-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span>ʼs all‐sufficient atonement”

                    the Levites watched to preserve the sacred flame from extinction, by supplying it with fuel night and day.

                        for ancient writers this altar in the sky ranked as “a special one”, according to <span class="persName-IRIDPATH">Ridpath</span>.

According to legend, <span class="persName-fictional-CRONUS">Cronus</span>—the chief of the most ancient gods, the giant <span class="persName-fictional-TITANS">Titans</span>—swallowed all his children in an attempt to thwart 
                        a prophesy that they would grow up to overthrow him. To prevent this fate befalling the latest child, <span class="persName-fictional-JUPITERGOD">Zeus</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-fictional-CRONUS">Cronus</span>ʼs wife, <span class="persName-fictional-RHEA">Rhea</span>, sent the infant to <span class="placeName-CRETE">Crete</span> to be hidden in a cave. Meanwhile, she deceived <span class="persName-fictional-CRONUS">Cronus</span> by giving him a rock to swallow in place of the infant god. 
                        When <span class="persName-fictional-JUPITERGOD">Zeus</span> had grown to maturity, he returned from <span class="placeName-CRETE">Crete</span> and forced his father to vomit his siblings—<span class="persName-fictional-HESTIA">Hestia</span>,

                        As if in compensation, stories are implied by the figures in the <span class="date-1800-1899">nineteenth‐century</span> star maps, in which <span class="name--LEOMINOR">Leo Minor</span>ʼs association with different bordering constellations is highlighted in each atlas. 
                        These varying choices were probably dictated primarily by the writerʼs instructions for locating the constellation in the sky, 
                        relative to other constellations. Since <span class="persName-JGREEN">Green</span> instructs the reader to find <span class="name--LEOMINOR">Leo Minor</span> “immediately to the southward of the hind paws of <span class="name--URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major</span>”,

                        At the same time, the differing pairings of highlighted creatures inevitably suggest competing narratives. 
                        <span class="persName-AJ">Jamieson</span>ʼs <span class="title-artwork-">plate 5</span> highlights the adjacency of

                        probably because both constellations were created by <span class="persName-JHEVELIUS">Hevelius</span>, 
                        as remarked in the text; however, the picture also seems to put the lion in pursuit of the lynx

                        <span class="persName-ASPIN">Aspin</span> bases the similarity between <span class="persName-scriptural-NIMROD">Nimrod</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-BELLEROPHON">Bellerophon</span> apparently on the story of the <span class="placeName-scriptural-TOWEROFBABEL">Tower of Babel</span>,

                        “that <span class="name--ZODIAC">zodiac</span> carries us back 90° on the Ecliptic, and its date must be fixed about 6450 years ago. 
                        This deduction, according to the chronology of the Sacred Writings, carries us back to the earliest ages of the human species on earth, 
                        and proves, at least, that Astronomy was among the first studies of mankind. 
                        The most rational way of accounting for this <span class="name--ZODIAC">zodiac</span> seems to be, by assigning it to the family of <span class="persName-scriptural-NOAH">Noah</span>, 
                        or perhaps to the patriarch himself; in which case it may be considered as a monument that perpetuates the actual state of the heavens 
                        immediately subsequent to the creation. In short, if it be fact, as appears, that <span class="persName-astronomical-NOAH">Noah</span> himself travelled eastward after the deluge, 
                        and his whole life leads us to believe he was versed in all the science of his time, 
                        he might also transmit to his posterity, the zodiac of the antedeluvians, without the equator or ecliptic. 
                        But though <span class="geogName-ASIA">Asia</span> might thus become the cradle of Astronomy, the stargazers of ancient <span class="placeName-EGYPT">Egypt</span> in process of time were, without doubt, 
                        instructed in the true system of the world; and attributed the order which reigns in nature to the wisdom of a supreme and eternal First Cause, 
                        though they publicly chimed in with the popular errors of the multitude”

                        At the time of the autunm equinox, “we are accustomed to say that when the <span class="name--SUN">Sun</span> comes to <span class="name--LIBRA">Libra</span>, . . . the days and nights are then equal all over the earth”, 
                    appropriately to the sign of the balance, “except at the poles; and that it is the beginning of day at the South Pole,

               <div class="p"><span class="name--LIBRA">Libra</span> bore differing meaning and significance for the Greeks and for the Romans—a difference reflected 
                        in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs first‐drafted and first fair‐copied lines versus his subsequently revised lines on the constellation (see textual note). 
                        His initial idea, playing on a name for <span class="name--LIBRA">Libra</span> as “the scales” rather than “the balance”, 
                        relates to the Greek notion that the constellation “perpetuate[d] the memory of <span class="persName-MOCHUS">Mochus</span>, the inventor of weights and measures” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS" target="_self"><span class="persName-AJ">Jamieson</span>, <span class="title-lesson-JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><i>Celestial Atlas</i></span></a>, 44).
                        In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs figure, because the scales are aerial, they “nothing to weigh would bear”, and “yet contain a thousand more” (stars, presumably), 
                        perhaps even “more than than the milky way” contains.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">In his revision, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> substitutes the Roman interpretation of the scales as a balance of justice, 
                        “in which twas vainly said / The crimes and virtues of men were weighed”—“vainly”, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> presumably means, because pagan justice 
                        has been superceded by Christian judgment. <span class="persName-IRIDPATH">Ridpath</span> explains why the representation of balanced justice made <span class="name--LIBRA">Libra</span> a “favoured constellation” for the Romans: 
                        “The <span class="name--MOON">Moon</span> was said to have been in <span class="name--LIBRA">Libra</span> when <span class="placeName-ROME">Rome</span> was founded”. Thus, according to the Roman writer <span class="persName-MANILIUS">Manilius</span> in the <span class="title-poem-MANILIUSASTRONOMICA"><i>Astronomica</i></span>, 
                        “What sign would better have the care of Italy . . . than that which controls all, knows the weights of things, marks totals, and separates the unequal from the equal, the sign in which the seasons are balanced and the hours of night and day match each other?” 
                        For it is given to <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> in turn to control all. <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> “belongs to the Balance, her rightful sign: beneath it <span class="placeName-ROME">Rome</span> and her sovereignty of the world were founded. <span class="placeName-ROME">Rome</span>, 
                        which controls the issue of events, exalting and depressing nations placed in the scales: beneath this sign was born the emperor, who has now effected a better foundation of the city and governs a world which hangs on his command alone”

                        Decidedly, <span class="persName-IRIDPATH">Ridpath</span> argues, the Archer is “misidentified as <span class="persName-fictional-CHIRON">Chiron</span>”,
