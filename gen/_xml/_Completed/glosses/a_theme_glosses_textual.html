                  <div class="p"><b>“on the other perhaps hand to save” (<span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span>)—</b>Presumably, 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> means either “perhaps on the other hand to save” or “on the other hand perhaps to save”. The former option seems more likely if <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> inserted “on the other” 
                    above the line here at the same time that he inserted “in any case” two lines above. As a reconstruction of the composition, one might imagine 
                    him composing so far as “perhaps”, pausing to insert “in any case” and “on the other” above their respective lines, and continuing the idiom 
                    with “hand” following “perhaps” on the baseline, as the manuscript shows.</div></span><br><br>
