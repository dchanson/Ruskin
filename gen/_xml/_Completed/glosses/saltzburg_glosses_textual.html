                    but then transposed the lines as indicated by the addition of a numeral 1 in front of line 9, and of a numeral 2 in front of line 8.</div></span><br><br>

                  <div class="p"><b>Line 43, substitution (MS VIII)—</b>In the left and right margin, 
                    line 43 is bracketed as if by large parentheses. Presumably, since the marks are in pencil like the other insertions by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs father, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, in this draft, 
                    then it was he also who was responsible for these marks. Unlike other substitutions prompted by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> in this draft, 
                    this revision is not confirmed by <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs overwriting in ink; however, the substitution did ultimately become incorporated in a version of this line for the published version 
                    <span class="title-annual-"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span>. 
                    As the published version makes clear, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs <i>while</i> should substitute for the phrase, <i>The weaker</i>, and not just for one word, <i>weaker</i>.</div></span><br><br>
