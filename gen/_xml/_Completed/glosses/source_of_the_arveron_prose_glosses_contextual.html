                    to the <span class="geogName-ARVERON">Source of the Arveron</span>” (<span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>; <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span> [<span class="date-1903">1903</span>])—</b><span class="geogName-ARVERON">The Arveyron</span>, 
                    a glacial tributary that rises from the <span class="geogName-MERDEGLACE">Mer de Glace</span>, which in the nineteenth century extended to the village of <span class="placeName-BOISBERNARD">Bois</span> and was there called the <span class="geogName-GLACIERDESBOIS">Glacier du Bois</span>. 
                    On <span class="date-1833-08-14">14 August 1833</span>, the Ruskins set out from <span class="placeName-GENEVA">Geneva</span> for the valley of <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</span> (<span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</span>, in their spelling), the final major excursion of their summer journey. 
                    They arrived in the village on <span class="date-1833-08-15">15 August</span> in rainy weather, prompting <span class="persName-SALVADOR">Salvador</span> to procure a loan of books, which included a set of 
                    <span class="title-book-SAUSSUREVOYAGES"><i>Voyages dans les Alpes</i></span> by <span class="persName-">Horace‐Bénédict de Saussure</span>, 
                    a copy of which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would receive for his birthday in <span class="date-1834">1834</span> (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 278, 280 n. 1). 
                    Shortly after arrival, <span class="persName-JR">John</span> and <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> ventured out on a walk to view the <span class="geogName-ARVERON">source of the Arveyron</span>, 
                    while <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> and cousin <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> stayed behind at the inn. Their courier, <a href="/notes/salvador_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-SALVADOR">Salvador</span></a>, 
                    also remained behind, so it is likely that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and his father 
                    were attended by the youths whom John mentions as competing to lead them to the riverʼs source. 
                    Children also swarmed <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> when they set out (likewise without <span class="persName-SALVADOR">Salvador</span>, apparently) to catch up with <span class="persName-JR">John</span> and <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>. 
                    The ladies walked alongside the <span class="geogName-ARVERON">Arve</span> until they reached a village, where they were told the view lay another quarter‐hourʼs walk ahead, so they decided to turn back, 
                    “to the great regret of our little man” who was guiding them “and a number of children who continually kept saying that it was a fine sight well worth seeing, 
                    using many times the terms ‘superbe, magnifique’ &c &c”. Returned to the inn, <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> were soon reunited with <span class="persName-JR">John</span> and <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, 
                    who returned “much pleased with the sight” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFT48" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</span></a>, 128–30).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">According to <span class="persName-JM">John Murray III</span> (<span class="date-1808-1892">1808–92</span>), in his <span class="date-1838">1838</span> guidebook to <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span>, 
                        the excursion to the source of the <span class="geogName-ARVERON">Arveyron</span> was “a delightful walk of an hour, along the plain of the valley, 
                        crossing beautiful meadows, and a little forest.” The so‐called source is an “affluent of the <span class="geogName-ARVE">Arve</span>” that “issues from below the vault of ice with which the <span class="geogName-GALCIERDESBOIS">Glacier du Bois</span>, 
                    the <span class="geogName-MERDEGLACE">Mer de Glace</span> terminates. . . . The vault of ice varies greatly in different seasons, and the author, at different times, has remarked a change 
                    of from 30 to 100 feet of height in the arch. It may be entered, but this is dangerous, and some have suffered for their temerity. . . . The danger is, that blocks 
                    of ice may detach themselves from the vault. . . . The scenery around the source is very grand, the deep blackness of the depth of vault, the bright and beautiful azure 
                    where the light is transmitted through the ice. The enormous rocks brought down by the glacier from the mountains above, here tumble over, 
                    and are deposited in the bed of the <span class="geogName-ARVERON">Arve</span>. Here, too, the dark forest, and the broken trunks of pines, add to the wild character of the scene”. 
                    Through this forest, a steeper and more difficult path also descended to the riverʼs glacier source, leading “active and strong” visitors who had set out first for the <span class="geogName-MONTANVERT">Montanvert</span> 
                    to visit the riverʼs source before they returned to <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix village</span>

                    but who, finding the post of honour preoccupied, followed very gravely, en suite” (<span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>; <i>Works</i> [<span class="date-1903">1903</span>])—</b><span class="persName-FMT">Frances Trollope</span> 
                    (<span class="date-1769-1863">1779–1863</span>) similarly encountered child‐guides when touring <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span>, where she 
                    “constantly found that these little local urchins are excellent in that capacity [of tour guide]. They know every mysterious hole and cranny; 
                    and have a marvellous talent of helping out their words, in answer to our imperfect German inquiries, with most amusing and expressive grimaces.” 
                    In <span class="placeName-HEIDELBERG">Heidelberg</span>, as her family party was preparing to ascend the path to the castle, they found themselves “accosted . . . by numberless little boys, 
                    who petitioned for the honour of serving us as guides amid the ruins. Their mode of address was very engaging; for they uniformly prefaced the request 
                    by presenting to each of us a pretty nosegay of freshly‐gathered flowers, out of the little baskets with which they were furnished, 
                    apparently as a sort of professional property. We selected a fine bright‐looking little fellow, who performed the office admirably; 
                    and, under his guidance, we now traversed the whole of this amazing fabric [of the castle ruins]”.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">In one episode narrated by <span class="persName-FMT">Trollope</span>, the competition among the boys to proffer their services turned less than charming. 
                    Wishing to ascend the heights above the castle, the Trollope family chose a “young rogue [who] testified his satisfaction, by every imaginable demonstration of glee. 
                    He smiled, he laughed, he bowed, as he scampered on before us; but, ere we had gone fifty yards, a boy, more than twice his age, presented himself, 
                    and, pushing aside the little one, began to chatter forth his own information, with an air of great importance. We wished to get rid of him, but it was impossible, 
                    and we proceeded with our double escort. On reaching the top of the ridge, . . . the little fellow stepped eagerly forward to point out the beautiful valley, 
                    and its bright clear brook. This was more than the senior could bear; and seizing upon his rival, with no gentle gripe, he thrust him rudely back. 
                    The gay smiles of the poor boy gave place to a burst of tears; whereupon I instantly found German enough to make my election clearly understood: 
                    ‘Nein geld fur sie’, was sufficient to make the elder stalk off, and my little man remained master the field. I never witnessed a prettier ebullition of happiness 
                    than this triumph produced. He has bowed his merry head every time I have looked at him; gathered every flower in our path to present to me; 
                    and, in short, made me feel exceedingly well pleased with myself for having protected the weak against the strong”.
                    The episode is summed up in a genre scene amid the sublime landscape: “My little guide sat on a neighbouring stone, with his elbow resting on his knee; 
                    looking down upon the river, and its boats, the town, and its castles, with an air of most happy idleness”
