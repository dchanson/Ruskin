                    Perhaps by placing this scene at the end of the section he meant to afford a retrospective glance at the journey along the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Middle Rhine</span>,

                    The Ruskins would have passed by <span class="placeName-BRAUBACH">Braubach</span> on <span class="date-1833-05-30">May 30</span> on the route from <span class="placeName-COBLENZ">Koblenz</span> to <span class="placeName-BOPPARD">Boppard</span>. 
                    <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span> does not mention the town specifically, although she does list the <span class="placeName-building-MARKSBURG">Marksburg</span>, the castle above <span class="placeName-BRAUBACH">Braubach</span>,

                        contains no architectural scenes in the streets of <span class="placeName-HEIDELBERG">Heidelberg</span>; its sole view connected with the city depicts the Renaissance facade of the <span class="placeName-building-HEIDELBERGCASTLE">castle</span>. 
                        Since that scene shows daytime activities, it also cannot have been planned to serve <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs proposal here for “Castle by moonlight”. 
                        A moonlit image of the distant castle does appear in <span class="title-annual-HEATHSANNUAL1833"><i>Heathʼs Picturesque Annual for <span class="date-1833">1833</span></i></span>—<span class="persName-CFS">Clarkson Stanfield</span>ʼs

                        draws on <span class="persName-LR">Leitch Ritchie</span>ʼs accompanying speculation about “what forms, that the eye of day never looked on, 
                        meet and wander there, or what voices are those that shriek on the gusts of night” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#HEATHSANNUAL1833" target="_self"><span class="title-annual-HEATHSANNUAL1833"><i>Travelling Sketches on the Rhine, and in Belgium and Holland</i></span></a>, 49 and opp.).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">A similar mood is conveyed by a moonlight view of <span class="placeName-building-HEIDELBERGCASTLE">Heidelberg Castle</span>, 
                        <span class="title-artwork-ROBERTSHEIDELBERG"><i>The Great Court of Heidelberg</i></span>, drawn by 
                        <span class="persName-DRP">David Roberts</span> for the <span class="date-1834">1834</span> edition of <span class="title-book-BULWERLYTTONPILGRIMS"><i>Pilgrims of the Rhine</i></span> by <span class="persName-EBL">Edward Bulwer‐Lytton</span>. 
                        The engraving shows the Renaissance facade of the castle, which is observed by a solitary figure. This appearance of solitude is queried by <span class="persName-EBL">Bulwer‐Lytton</span>ʼs narrator, who, like <span class="persName-LR">Ritchie</span>, 
                        poses a rhetorical question about the presence of spirits—a wonder that is reflected in many passages of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>: 
                        “Who shall say what millions of spiritual beings glide invisibly among scenes apparently the most deserted?” 
                        To suggest the presence of these beings surrounding <span class="persName-DRP">Roberts</span>ʼs solitary spectator, this chapter headpiece engraving is answered by a tailpiece vignette, <span class="title-artwork-PARRISVISITATMOONLIGHT"><i>The Visit at Moonlight</i></span>, 
                        drawn by <span class="persName-ETP">E. T. Parris</span>, in which fairies gather around a tomb. This scene adumbrates the sad conclusion of the novelʼs journey: <span class="placeName-HEIDELBERG">Heidelberg</span> will prove the final destination of the travelers, 
                        since the heroine, <span class="persName-fictional_person-GERTRUDE">Gertrude</span>, will expire while visiting the “haunted valley of the <span class="geogName-NECKAR">Neckar</span>”, 
                        leaving her father, <span class="persName-fictional_person-VANE">Vane</span>, and lover, <span class="persName-fictional_person-TREVYLYAN">Trevylyan</span>, to return bereft to <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>

                        but <span class="persName-EBL">Bulwer‐Lytton</span>ʼs tale is especially resonant with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs proposed series of images. 
                        The fairies, who have accompanied the travelers throughout their tour, gather in the Great Court of <span class="placeName-building-HEIDELBERGCASTLE">Heidelberg Castle</span> 
                        to sing the <span class="title-poem-BULWERLYTTONSONGOFTHEFAIRIES">“Song of the Fairies in the Ruins of Heidelberg”</span>; 
                        and then they fly to a “small green spot” in the forest by the <span class="geogName-NECKAR">Neckar</span>, which they know “by instinct” will become <span class="persName-fictional_person-GERTRUDE">Gertrude</span>ʼs grave. 
                        Their mourning is interrupted by the appearance of the <span class="persName-fictional_person-DARKWITCH">Dark Witch of the Blight and Blast</span>, 
                        who may be the source of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs projected illustration of a “Spectre”. Moreover, a history is related of this spot, 
                        telling of a hermit “in the early ages of Christianity” who retired here, relinquishing a Byronic existence 
                        “mingl[ing] the poet with the lawless chief”. Events had parted him from a damsel, “the presider over the tournament and gaillard”—a 
                        detail that might have suggested <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs planned “tournament” picture

                        While <span class="persName-EBL">Bulwer‐Lytton</span>ʼs story is not necessarily required to make sense of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs scheme for illustrating <span class="title-composite-JRHEIDELBERGCOMP">“<span class="placeName-HEIDELBERG">Heidelberg</span>”</span>, 
                        which sufficiently corresponds to the fancies about sprites, spectres, and medieval chivalry in the sectionʼs poem, <a href="/witnesses/heidelberg_poem_msix" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRHEIDELBERG">“Now from the smiling afternoon” [“Heidelberg”]</span></a>, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs engagement with <span class="persName-EBL">Bulwer‐Lytton</span>ʼs novel was a timely addition to the Ruskinsʼ library in <span class="date-1834-06">June 1834</span>

                    As proposed here, a pair of features associated with <span class="placeName-STGOAR">St Goar</span>—the “whirlpool” 
                    that churns the river beneath the <span class="geogName-LORELEI">Lorelei</span>, and the <span class="placeName-building-RHEINFELS">Burg Rheinfels</span> 
                    castle ruin that rises above the town—would respectively have headed the poem and the essay of the <span class="title-composite-JRSTGOARCOMP">“<span class="placeName-STGOAR">St. Goar</span>”</span> section.

                    Set between these headpieces and at the end, respectively, tailpieces were to be formed by another complementary pair: images of <span class="geogName-GODESBERG">Godesberg</span> and of <span class="geogName-DRACHENFELS">Drachenfels</span>, 
                    referring to prominences with castles on opposite sides of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> below <span class="placeName-BONN">Bonn</span>. 
                    The latter images hearkened to the commencement of the Ruskinsʼ <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> journey. (The <span class="geogName-GODESBERG">Godesberg</span>

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was able to reference this experience, since <span class="persName-WBI">Brockedon</span>ʼs plate is a representation less of <span class="placeName-LECCO">Lecco</span> itself 
                        than of the lake and the “high mountain” opposite the town “which sinks abruptly to the lake” and which “is seen . . .from <span class="placeName-MILAN">Milan</span>”—<span class="geogName-MOUNTRESEGONE">Resegone</span>,

                        <span class="title-artwork-JMWTAGARDEN"><i>A Garden</i></span>, engraved by <span class="persName-WME">William Miller</span>. 
                        Presenting a fountain on an elaborate terrace with a semicircular balustrade, the garden scene is suggestively Italianate. In contrast,

                        positions the spectator on a hill overlooking a familiarly English village with its pointed Gothic church and a neoclassical manor house in the distance. 
                        Enhancing the Italian feel of <span class="title-artwork-JMWTAGARDEN"><i>A Garden</i></span>, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs half‐title page 
                        also carries an epigraph from <span class="persName-PETRARCH">Petrarch</span>, although the lines suggest a scene more akin to the English scene than to the Italianate garden:

                    is unidentified. The Ruskins visited several villas, all of which can be identified, as they rowed south from <span class="placeName-CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</span>, following the eastern shore of the <span class="geogName-LAKECOMO">lake</span> toward the city of <span class="placeName-COMO">Como</span>, 
                    and then crossed to the western shore near the city in order to view villas along the <span class="placeName-building-VIAREGINACOMO">Via Regina</span>. Along this passage or anywhere else along <span class="geogName-LAKECOMO">Lake Como</span>, a villa named “Poro” 
                    has so far gone undetected in English guidebooks published in the <span class="date-1800-1850">first half of the nineteenth century</span>.

                    the Ruskins encountered a place associated with the noble Lombard family, Porro. According to <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span>, this drive lasted four‐and‐a‐half hours, which is precisely 
                    the time allowed in an <span class="date-1836">1836</span> guidebook for the shortest coach journey—a twenty‐five mile route passing through <span class="placeName-BARLASSINA">Barlassina</span>, which traverses the <span class="placeName-BRIANZAPROVINCE">Brianza</span> region, associated 
                    with the Porro family (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFT48" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-RFT48">Diary of <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span>, <span class="date-1833">1833</span></span></a>, 46;

                    Falling “straight between two rocks” that “rise so perpendicularly and so near each other that the sun never reaches the bottom”, the cascade chilled the travelers 
                    “when we went in between the rocks”. Continuing south, the Ruskins stopped at a succession of villas: <span class="placeName-building-VILLAPLINIANA">Villa Pliniana</span>, the subject of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem;

                        engraved by <span class="persName-WME">William Miller</span> (frontispiece), the view is taken from the shore near a pier where boats are gathered. In <span class="title-artwork-PROUTCOMO"><i><span class="placeName-COMO">Como</span></i></span>, 
                        the right side of the picture (the west side of the city) is dominated by the “conical hill, on whose highest summit are the scattered ruins of an ancient castle”—<span class="placeName-building-CASTELLOBARADELLO">Castello Baradello</span>, 
                        with its “lofty square turret still crowning the top” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MAZZONIMILAN" target="_self"><span class="persName-MMAZZONI">Mazzoni</span>, <span class="title-book-MAZZONIMILAN"><i>The Travellerʼs Guide of <span class="placeName-MILAN">Milan</span></i></span></a>, 93)—and 
                        on the left side of the picture (the east side of the city) the Rococo cupola of the <span class="placeName-building-COMOCATHEDRAL">Duomo</span> is conspicuous, with its Gothic nave extending parallel to the plate. In the foreground, fishermen throw their nets from a boat, which is 
                        anchored near a stone pier. In <span class="title-artwork-PROUTLAKEOFCOMO"><i><span class="geogName-LAKECOMO">Lake of Como</span></i></span>, the scene looks out to the lake from the town,

                        Close to shore, boats huddle behind a stone breakwater, and stairs lead up walls bordering the water to a large building with balconies. This picture seems the likelier source for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs “port of <span class="placeName-COMO">Como</span>”,

                        For <span class="persName-WBI">Brockedon</span>, the plate describes the end of this route in “the approach to <span class="placeName-COMO">Como</span> . . . one of the most beautiful views in which this city is an object”. 
                        For the Ruskins, a vista like this of <span class="placeName-COMO">Como</span> would have formed a receding view, as they drove away from the city, southeast toward <span class="placeName-MILAN">Milan</span>. <span class="persName-WBI">Brockedon</span> explains the plate, in which <span class="placeName-COMO">Como</span> “is seen, far below the vineyards

                        which in this view is almost hidden by the surrounding hills [blocking the view of the lake as it extends to the right, i.e. northern, edge of the scene].

                        Beyond the hills which surround the lake, the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> are seen stretching across the horizon, and conspicuous among these is the beautiful form of <span class="geogName-MONTEROSA">Monte Rosa</span>”

                        Thy sign the silver swan”—but it also points to a hidden darkness amidst <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>ʼs cheerful scene. As <span class="persName-JPSCHOLAR">Jan Piggott</span> has found, 
                        the host of that inn, who was fondly remembered by travelers, was drowned in the flood of <span class="date-1818">1818</span> that destroyed a large portion of <span class="placeName-MARTIGNY">Martigny</span>. 
                        In <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, when compiling his plan for illustration, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> could have found a eulogy for “the landlord of the <span class="placeName-building-LACYGNE">Swan Inn</span>” 
                        as part of an account of the <span class="placeName-MARTIGNY">Martigny</span> flood included in 
                        <span class="title-annual-ROSCOETOURISTSWITZERLANDITALY"><i>Jenningʼs Landscape Annual for <span class="date-1830">1830</span></i></span>, published the same year as the illustrated <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY1830"><i>Italy</i></span>

                        If <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> missed these connections at that time, he noted years later in reference to this illustration that <span class="placeName-building-LACYGNE">La Cygne</span> was <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>ʼs preferred inn when based in <span class="placeName-MARTIGNY">Martigny</span>

               <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would also have known a plate by <span class="persName-SP">Samuel Prout</span>, 
                        <span class="title-artwork-PROUTMARTIGNY"><i>Martigny</i></span>, for <span class="title-annual-ROSCOETOURISTSWITZERLANDITALY"><i>Jenningʼs Landscape Annual for <span class="date-1830">1830</span></i></span>. 
                        The scene is much closer than <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>ʼs to the tower of <span class="placeName-building-LABATIAZCASTLE">La Bâtiaz</span>. 
                        Whereas <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>ʼs vignette features the lively tourist accommodations 
                        on the <span class="placeName-building-STRADADELSEMPIONE">Simplon road</span>, <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>ʼs plate 
                        dwells on the picturesque textures of humble, roughly patched chalets beneath the symbolic memorial to ruined power towering above them 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#ROSCOETOURISTSWITZERLANDITALY" target="_self"><span class="persName-TRT">Roscoe</span>, <span class="title-annual-ROSCOETOURISTSWITZERLANDITALY"><i>The Tourist in Switzerland and Italy</i></span></a>, 73 opp.). 
                        This scene lay within the compass of the main town of <span class="placeName-MARTIGNY">Martigny</span> (I am grateful to 
                        <span class="persName-DANIELAVAJ">Daniela Vaj</span> for this information). As <span class="persName-JM">John Murray III</span> explains, <span class="placeName-MARTIGNY">Martigny</span> 
                        “consist[ed] of two parts—the one situated on the <span class="placeName-building-STRADADELSEMPIONE">Simplon road</span>”, which served 
                        as “the constant resort of travellers”, and which presumably is represented by <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>ʼs bustling scene; 
                        and “the other, <span class="placeName-BOURGDEMARTIGNY">Bourg de Martigny</span>”, which 
                        lay “more than a mile distant up the valley of the <span class="geogName-DRANSERIVER">Dranse</span>” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838" target="_self"><span class="persName-JM">Murray</span>, <span class="title-book-MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><i>Hand‐book for Travellers in Switzerland</i></span></a>, 155). 
                        <span class="persName-WBI">Brockedon</span>, with his usual distaste for whatever could not be accommodated to the picturesque or sublime, 
                        calls the <span class="placeName-BOURGDEMARTIGNY">Bourg</span> “a narrow dirty village”, which he regrets that travelers were compelled “to traverse”, 
                        “after leaving the inn at <span class="placeName-MARTIGNY">Martigny</span>, where travellers usually rest”, in order to connect with the road ascending to the pass of the <span class="geogName-STBERNARD">Great St. Bernard</span> 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#BROCKEDONILLUSTRATIONS" target="_self"><span class="persName-WBI">Brockedon</span>, <span class="title-book-BROCKEDONILLUSTRATIONS"><i>Illustrations of the Passes of the Alps</i></span></a>, 
                        “The Great Saint Bernard”, 2). <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>ʼs humble scene, however, also does not show
