                        When the time comes to recite his lesson, <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> is disgraced, because he has procrastinated, 
                        distracted by play outdoors and by the more entertaining reading that occupies his sister, <span class="persName-fictional-MARYME">Mary</span>. 
                        Amid these distractions, <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> has studied only fitfully, trying &#x201C;the patience of a mother&#x201D; who has more time to hear his imperfectly memorized lesson. 
                        When even his <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMAMEFS">mother</span> limits the number of recitals she will entertain, <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> turns to his compliant sister. 
                        Although untrained in Latin, <span class="persName-fictional-MARYME">Mary</span> reads well enough to warn him to be more exact (1:58, 75).</div>

                        that he may &#x201C;early learn habits of attention and application&#x201D; (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>, <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><i>Frank: A Sequel</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 1:89). 
                        His failure leads the adults to confer among themselves, as do the parents in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s version, 
                        but the discussion between <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s adults is solemn, reflecting the book&#x02BC;s thesis, which is set forth in the author&#x02BC;s preface: 
                        parents should instill habits of self&#x2010;control in their sons before sending them to public school. 
                        If parents neglect to train their sons in self&#x2010;command, the boys will succumb to their schoolfellows&#x02BC; reckless challenges to prove their &#x201C;manliness&#x201D; 
                        in foolish and damaging ways. The argument is not that proper manliness is to be instilled by corporal punishment: 
                        <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span>&#x02BC;s response to his disgrace ultimately disproves <span class="persName-fictional-COLONELBIRCHME">Colonel Birch</span>&#x02BC;s contention that a boy will learn his Latin 
                        only if its rules are &#x201C;flogged&#x201D; into him by schoolmasters. Rather, as <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> demonstrates, self&#x2010;control must be mastered by the boy himself. 
                        Recovering from his sobs, <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> retires to gain control over himself and his get his lesson by heart. Then, in the scene that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> adapts to his own purposes, 
                        <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> &#x201C;march&#x005B;es&#x005D; up&#x201D; to <span class="persName-fictional-COLONELBIRCHME">Colonel Birch</span> to say his lesson perfectly (just as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> &#x201C;marched up&#x201D; to her <span class="persName-fictional-PAPA">father</span> 
                        to command his time, but without disgracing herself like <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span>). In <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s tale, <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> proves over the following weeks that he can be relied on, 
                        and his <span class="persName-fictional-PAPAMEFS">father</span> rescinds his decision to send <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> to school earlier than originally planned 
                        (see &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>, <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><i>Frank: A Sequel</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 1:86&#x2013;96).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">According to <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><i>Frank: A Sequel</i></span>, the cultural cause of parental laxness in instilling boys&#x02BC; self&#x2010;discipline is not neglect of education, 
                        but a parents&#x02BC; preoccupation with and excessive intervention in learning. The &#x201C;fault of the present day&#x201D;, according to the author&#x02BC;s preface, 
                        is the phenomenon of &#x201C;anxious private education&#x201D;. While the danger to a home&#x2010;schooled boy is effeminacy, the undermining of manliness 
                        is caused only in part by living too much at home &#x201C;&#x2018;with gentle girls and women&#x2019;&#x201D;. In contemporary home education, both fathers and mothers 
                        can be at fault for &#x201C;too much anxiety concerning details. Parents and private tutors are not only too eager to adopt every new receipt 
                        for teaching much in a short time, but are also too easily alarmed by every deficiency which they perceive in their pupils, 
                        and draw too readily evil auguries from every trifle. They are so anxious to make their pupils go on, and go right, 
                        and go straight, every instant, that they deprive them of the power of acting, thinking, feeling for themselves. 
                        Thus they turn them either into helpless puppets, who must cease to move, or fall when the guiding strings are no longer pulled; 
                        or, if they be not reduced to this automaton state, they become restive, wilful creatures, who, the instant they are at liberty, 
                        set off in a contrary direction to that in which they have been forced&#x201D; (1:54, xvi&#x2013;xvii).</div>

                        not &#x201C;the old pony; or, as <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> would call it, the <i>tame</i> pony&#x201D;, but a &#x201C;spirited&#x201D; horse.

                        perhaps they do not know how to leap, or to run, or to ride; for this they are laughed at by their school&#x2010;fellows, and they often get into mischief,

                    being at a considerable distance from it, you hear no report. If, however, you knew that the light was occasioned 
                    by the inflammation of gunpowder in a musket or pistol, you would conclude that it was attended with sound,

                    than it was when we first got into the fields&#x2019;&#x201D;. His <span class="persName-fictional-FATHERJJ">father</span> ties together the past experience and the present conversation:

                    His summary of the procedure for lifting and supporting a ship&#x02BC;s keel, besides being slightly inaccurate, 
                    is difficult to follow, because <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> omits <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span>&#x02BC;s contextualizing.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span> begins with more obvious and traditional means of raising a ship in dry dock: 
                    &#x201C;&#x2018;Some time ago, the day my <span class="persName-fictional-PAPAME">father</span> took me into the dock&#x2010;yard, he showed me a ship lying in what is called a dock. 
                    The keel was to be repaired, and for this purpose it was necessary to raise up the ship, so that the workmen might get underneath. 
                    The question my <span class="persName-fictional-PAPAME">father</span> asked me was, &#x2018;how the vessel could be raised?&#x2019; I was an hour puzzling about it, . . . 
                    but never &#x005B;thought&#x005D; of the easy way that was before my eyes&#x2014;to let in the water from outside of the dock. The water,
                    you know, would gradually float the vessel, and raise it up to the proper height, where it could be propped up, and the water let out again next tide.&#x2019;&#x201D;</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-fictional-LUCYME">Lucy</span> inquires about a &#x201C;different way of raising a ship&#x201D; that she knows their <span class="persName-fictional-PAPAME">father</span> had described to <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span>. 
                        <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span> goes on: &#x201C;&#x2018;You must first of all know, that when a vessel is floated into a dock to be repaired, 
                        <i>she</i> is allowed to settle down with her keel upon thick wooden blocks, along the middle of the dock: 
                        . . . formerly when she was to be raised up, for the people to get under the keel, two or three hundred <i>shores</i>, 
                        or props of timber, were placed all under her bottom, nearly upright; wedges were then just pointed under the lower end of each of these shores, 
                        and all the workmen from every part of the dock&#x2010;yard being summoned with their <i>mauls</i>, or huge hammers, 
                        and stationed one or two to each shore, the wedges were all struck at the same instant by word of command. 
                        A few blows from all the mauls was sufficient just to raise the ship from off the blocks, which were then taken away, 
                        and the ship was left hanging in the air, supported by the shores&#x2019;&#x201D;.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">The new way, which has replaced this time&#x2010; and labor&#x2010;intensive method, is what <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> summarizes: 
                        &#x201C;&#x2018;The blocks on which the keel is to lie are not solid lumps of wood; they are composed of three pieces, two of which are <i>wedges</i>, 
                        and when these are knocked out, the centre piece of the block falls. The ship is floated into the dock as usual, 
                        and when the water subsides, the keel rests on the new&#x2010;fashioned blocks: the forest of shores are then firmly placed 
                        under all parts of the ship&#x02BC;s bottom, in the same way as I described to you before, but without any wedges &#x005B;pointed beneath the shores&#x005D;. 
                        Now, <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span>, comes the beautiful contrivance&#x2014;two or three men only are sufficient to do the rest: 
                        they give a few knocks on the sides of the wedges, of which the blocks are composed&#x2014;out they fly&#x2014;the blocks sink, 
                        and the ship hangs on the shores&#x2019;&#x201D;.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-fictional-LUCYME">Lucy</span> agrees that &#x201C;&#x2018;it is such a pretty contrivance, that 1 should like very much to see it done.

                    is owing to a certain power called <i>elasticity</i>; which may, perhaps, arise from the particles of those bodies, 
                    though disturbed, not being drawn out of each other&#x02BC;s attraction; therefore, as soon as the force upon them ceases to act, 
                    they restore themselves to their former position&#x201D;. However, &#x201C;the reverse of the attraction of cohesion&#x201D; or &#x201C;repulsion&#x201D; 
                    prevails &#x201C;if a glass or any hard substance be broken&#x201D;, and &#x201C;the parts cannot be made to cohere without first being moistened,

                    not only because <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s characters travel to the West Country, but also because <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span>, 
                    from the moment he hears the prospect of going to the seaside, longs &#x201C;&#x2018;to see mountains, and go up them with my portable barometer&#x2019;&#x201D; (1:186). 
                    This desire arises near the beginning of the book, when <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span> proposes to measure the height of a mountain by comparing the difference between barometric pressures at sea level and at the top the mountain, 
                    and converting the difference in degrees to a scale in feet. Prior to their journey, <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span> and his <span class="persName-fictional-PAPAME">father</span> carry out the experiment on a more limited scale by scaling 
                    a church tower with the portable barometer in hand, thereby working out the tower&#x02BC;s height. <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span> uses this episode to prompt learning through several comparisons of a thematic kind, 
                    including tensions between <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span>&#x02BC;s bent for theorizing and <span class="persName-fictional-LUCYME">Lucy</span>&#x02BC;s pragmatism, between <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span>&#x02BC;s solemn methodicalness and <span class="persName-fictional-LUCYME">Lucy</span>&#x02BC;s mercurial imaginativeness, 
                    and between <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span>&#x02BC;s braving adventures to the point of imprudence and <span class="persName-fictional-LUCYME">Lucy</span>&#x02BC;s voicing anxieties to the point of endangering others (see 1:19&#x2013;38).</div>

                    This portion of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s narrative was taken by <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> to be &#x201C;probably a bit of history&#x201D;

                     But while <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> folds in at least one episode directly from <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span> (the exploding wagon), 
                    it does seem unlikely that he would wholly invent a journey taken in the opposite direction from <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s characters,

                    had only recently begun promoting itself as a tourist destination. Tending to the confirm the basis in reality, 
                    the Ruskins are known to have visited <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> on at least one other occasion, and probably more (see

                                    and they are commonly accompanied or followed by lightning. When these approach a ship, the sailors present and brandish their swords to disperse them,

                                    where there appeared a great black cloud, which electrified his apparatus positively to a very high degree. 
                                    This cloud went towards the west, the dust followed it, and continued to rise higher and higher, 
                                    till it composed a thick pillar in the form of a sugar loaf, and at length it seemed to be in contact 
                                    with the cloud. At some distance from this there came another great cloud, with a long stream of smaller ones, 
                                    which electrified his apparatus negatively, and when they came near the positive cloud, a flash of
                                    lightning was seen to dart through the cloud of dust, upon which the negative clouds spread very much, and dissolved in rain,

                        <span class="persName-GBECCARIA">Beccaria</span> made his reputation as one of <span class="geogName-EUROPE">Europe</span>&#x02BC;s most fervent champions of <span class="persName-BF">Franklin</span>&#x02BC;s theories, positioning himself in opposition to the rival French school of electricians

                        the ability to model massive natural forces in laboratory experiments and pose theoretical explanations confirmed the power and prestige of <span class="date-1637-1815">Enlightenment</span> ideology

                        In <span class="persName-JP">Priestley</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-PRIESTLEYHISTORYOFELECTRICITY"><i>History</i></span>, these wonders pose challenges to grasping the electrical principles that pervade them. 
                        The aurora borealis is hypothesized as arising from &#x201C;the flashing of electric fire from positive towards negative clouds at a great distance&#x201D;, 
                        a phenomenon made possible when the upper atmosphere becomes heated. Just so, <span class="persName-JP">Priestley</span> confirms, recent experiments with the mineral <span class="name--TOURMALINE">tourmaline</span> 
                        reveal that it &#x201C;will, without friction, both emit and absorb the electric fluid, only by the increase or diminution of its heat&#x201D;

                        Investigations of the electrical properties of <span class="name--TOURMALINE">tourmaline</span> were conducted by the German physicist 
                        <span class="persName-FUTA">Franz Ulrich Theodosius Aepinus</span> (<span class="date-1724-1802">1724&#x2013;1802</span>), who found that, 
                        by heating the mineral, a positive charge collects on one face of the crystal and a negative charge on the opposite face. This discovery, a historian explains, 
                        was interpreted as strongly favoring &#x201C;the Franklinian doctrine that there were two contrary modes of electrification possible in nature&#x2014;called

                        In <span class="persName-JP">Priestley</span>&#x02BC;s chapter, the origin of these observations is cited as <span class="persName-JWILCKE">Wilcke</span>&#x02BC;s translation of <span class="persName-BF">Franklin</span>&#x02BC;s letters on electricity,

                        Their appraisal on balance awarded qualified support to <span class="persName-BF">Franklin</span>&#x02BC;s ideas (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#HEILBRONELECTRICITY" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-JLH">Heilbron</span>, <span class="title-book-HEILBRONELECTRICITY"><i>Electricity in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 384&#x2013;90).
