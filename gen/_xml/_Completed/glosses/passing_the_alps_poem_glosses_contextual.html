                        in both particulars and structural function. In <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs poem, the speaker retraces imaginatively the experience of mountain crossing (nominally via the <span class="geogName-STBERNARD">Great St. Bernard Pass</span>, 
                        actually via the <span class="geogName-SIMPLON">Simplon Pass</span>), 
                        from eyeing the distant <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> when “[t]he level plain I travelled silently”, to surveying the “silver zone” 
                        of the mountain road “[s]een oʼer the wall by him who journies up”, 
                        to feeling “ravishment” at “the first glimpses of fair <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>”

                        While <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> does not allow his spectator to review the entire span of crossing, preferring to divide the stages of crossing 
                        among different poems, he adopts <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs structural device of one poem serving as an epitome of the experience of mountain crossing.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Specifically, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> adopts <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs trope of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> 
                        as “the barriers of a World” (in his travel journal, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> reacted to his first view of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> 
                        as “the barrier of another world” that “seemed to say to the curiosity of Man ‘Hitherto shalt thou go & no further’” 
                        [<a href="/notes/bibliography#ROGERSJOURNAL" target="_self"><span class="persName-JRH">Hale</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-ROGERSJOURNAL"><i>The Italian Journal of Samuel Rogers</i></span></a>, 144]). 
                        In his poem, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> develops this trope from a historical perspective. Historically, 
                        civilizations were divided by the barrier of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> (e.g., barbarians from <span class="placeName-ROME">Rome</span>); 
                        and from a modern perspective, the spectator looks back on a past when civilizations struggled against this barrier with danger and difficulty, 
                        whereas to the nineteenth‐century traveler the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> present the “fairy‐course” 
                        of a “path of pleasure”—referring, presumably, to the convenience afforded by modern engineering. Traveling the <span class="placeName-CONTINENT">Continent</span> 
                        in <span class="date-1814">1814</span>, during the year of peace established by the <span class="date-1814-04-11">Treaty of Fontainebleau</span> and <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span>ʼs exile 
                        to <span class="geogName-ELBA">Elba</span>, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> in his journal, like the guidebook writers, 
                        glamorized <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span>ʼs engineering feat in the <span class="geogName-SIMPLON">Simplon Pass</span>, 
                        which transformed what had been a mere zigzag mule path into “a road, wide & smooth as any that lead from town to town”, 
                        enabling travelers to gaze on the sublime scenery from a vantage of safety. One “could not but wonder at the boldness that planned, & the genius & 
                        industry that executed” the carriage road built for military invasion, and now paving the way for revival of the Grand Tour on modernized terms

                        Similar achievements were made in the decade prior to the Ruskinsʼ visit, with <span class="placeName-AUSTRIA">Austria</span>ʼs engineers 
                        laying a carriage road through the <span class="geogName-SPLUGEN">Splügen Pass</span>, and the <span class="placeName-SARDINIAKINGDOM">Kingdom of Sardinia</span> 
                        backing the easement of trade and communication through the <span class="geogName-SANBERNARDINOPASS">San Bernardino Pass</span>.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">In <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEALPS">“The Alps”</span>, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> compares the struggles of several historical 
                        Alpine travelers, including <span class="persName-HANNIBAL">Hannibal</span> and his army, which is the solitary example that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> selects 
                        for elaboration in his poem. <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs imagination was doubtless fired by <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>ʼs <span class="title-artwork-JMWTHANNIBAL"><i>Hannibal Passing the Alps</i></span>—the 
                        vignette for <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEALPS">“The Alps”</span> in the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> illustrated edition of 
                        <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY1830"><i>Italy</i></span>. The vignette depicts the <span class="placeName-CARTHAGEANCIENT">Carthaginian</span> invaders filing through the mountains with their horse cavalry and elephants, 
                        as archers defend the columns (perhaps against the local peoples who, <span class="persName-POLYBIUS">Polybius</span> relates, harried them along the way 
                        [<a href="/notes/bibliography#POLYBIUSHISTORIES" target="_self"><span class="persName-POLYBIUS">Polybius</span>, <span class="title-book-POLYBIUSHISTORIES"><i>Histories</i></span></a>, bk. 3, chaps. 50–53]). 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> develops this spectacle in his poem, although substituting the commotion of a storm in the sky for <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>ʼs 
                        warfare on the mountainside. <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>ʼs vignette must be what he identifies simply as “Hannibal” as his source for illustrating the poem in the

                        Even the title of his poem appears to be based on <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>ʼs vignette title, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> must have taken from a separate issue of the plates since <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY1830"><i>Italy</i></span> contains no list of artistsʼ illustrations by title

                        of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> from the borderland between <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span> and <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span>, 
                        along with the first signs of “Swiss” character in the cottages of the <span class="geogName-BLACKFOREST">Black Forest</span>.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">In this broader view of the plan, in which <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">“Passing the Alps”</span> serves as the hinge 
                        between the cluster about the first sighting of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> and the cluster about crossing the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        can be seen as using the title of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs poem, <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEALPS">“The Alps”</span>, 
                        to name a composite section, <span class="title-composite-JRTHEALPSCOMP">“The Alps”</span>, at the center of the cluster about first sighting. For this proposed composite, 
                        he may have intended a poem drafted in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>,

                        which contains the allusion to <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs hail to the distant <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>: 
                        “Who first beholds” the <span class="geogName-">Alps</span> “instantly receives into his soul / A sense, a feeling that he loses not, / 
                        A something that informs him ʼtis an hour, / Whence he may date henceforward and forever!”

                  <div class="p">At the same time, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was observant of how <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> uses narrative poems both to entertain

                        and <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEALPS">“The Alps”</span>, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> digresses into complementary verse tales,

                    <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> erred in placing <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">“Passing the Alps”</span>

                    (the latter collected from <a href="/apparatuses/msvii_apparatus" target="_self">MS VII</a>), causing <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem 
                    to function as a transition between <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> and <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span>, 
                    rather than between <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span> and <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>. The latter arrangement appears to have been in 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs mind as early as the MS IA, <i>g</i>.2 sequence,

                    crossing is more appropriately connected with the western passage.</div>

                        from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="title-poem-JRTHESUMMIT">“The Summit”</span>, 
                        in which the young poet experimented with narrative digression (see contextual glosses for

                  <div class="p">In one respect, however, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs erroneous placement of <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">“Passing the Alps”</span> 
                        can be justified by the <a href="/witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii" target="_self"><span class="title-bibliography_text-JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Proposed Additional Contents</span></a>, 
                        which suggests that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did plan to mirror the cluster about a north to south crossing with a cluster about the east to west crossing. 
                        The <span class="geogName-SPLUGEN">Splügen Pass</span> cluster, extending from the sections entitled <span class="title-composite-JRPASSINGTHEALPSCOMP">“Passing the Alps”</span> 
                        through <span class="title-composite-JRDESCENTCOMP">“The Descent”</span> and poems on the Italian lakes, were to be reflected in reverse 
                        by a cluster including <span class="title-composite-JRTHEASCENTCOMP">“The Ascent”</span> and <span class="title-composite-JRTHEGRANDSTBERNARDCOMP">“The Grand St. Bernard”</span> 
                        leading to <span class="title-composite-JRTHELAKEOFGENEVA">“The Lake of Geneva”</span>. Had <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                    completed these latter poems and essays, he would likely have exploited <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs tropes about crossings here, as well. 
                    <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs mistaken ordering is an understandable outcome of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs tendency to have abandoned his grandiose schemes, 
                    once he realized his goals in a portion of the plan.</div></span><br><br>
