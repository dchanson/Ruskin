                    revised the final line in order to repair the rhyme with the previous line, “In short such changes <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> does now take”, by inventing a new ending:<br/> 
                     <span class="center">“That I canʼt tell them, and <i>an end I make</i>”.</span></div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">What is additionally interesting about <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs original ending, besides the unrhymed couplet, 
                    is the crowding of these final lines on the page, as if he was rushed or had miscalculated. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> squeezed the last three poetic lines, 
                    including their respective runover lines, into three ruled lines of the notebook, whereas earlier he allowed separate ruled lines not only to each line of poetry 
                    but also to its runover. In fact, the final runover line is crowded onto the ruled line that also contains the heading for the following poem, “poem III” 
                    (i.e., <a href="/witnesses/the_defiance_of_war_msi" target="_self">“The Defiance of War”</a>). Perhaps Ruskin started “poem III” 
                    before he had finished “On Scotland.”</div></span><br><br>
