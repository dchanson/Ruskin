                    of <span class="persName-PPR">Peter Paul Rubens</span> (<span class="date-1577-1640">1577–1640</span>) has been disputed since the seventeenth century, 
                    when writers made claims for both <span class="placeName-ANTWERP">Antwerp</span> and <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span>. 
                    The controversy became heated in <span class="date-1853">1853</span>, thirty years after the Ruskinsʼ visit, 
                    when a Dutch historian uncovered a story about <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>ʼs father, who was arrested for an adulterous affair with <span class="persName-AOS">Anna of Saxony</span>, imprisoned, 
                    and then sent to <span class="placeName-SIEGEN">Siegen</span> in <span class="placeName-WESTPHALIA">Westphalia</span>, 
                    where he lived under conditions of house arrest. He was joined in <span class="date-1573">1573</span> by his wife and children, who had been living in <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span>. According to this account, 
                    the family stayed in <span class="placeName-SIEGEN">Siegen</span> until <span class="date-1578">1578</span>, a year after <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>ʼs birth, and then they returned to <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span>, 
                    where <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> spent his boyhood until <span class="date-1589">1589</span>. In that year, his father died, and the family relocated to <span class="placeName-ANTWERP">Antwerp</span>. 
                    These revelations of the affair in the nineteenth century—far from settling the question of <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>ʼs birthplace, by placing the event logically in <span class="placeName-SIEGEN">Siegen</span>—only 
                    fired the respective champions of <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span> and <span class="placeName-ANTWERP">Antwerp</span> to defend their claims. Scholarly debate on the subject persists to the present day, but the most persuasive arguments 
                    point to <span class="placeName-SIEGEN">Siegen</span>.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span> may have become known as the birthplace not only because <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> definitely grew up there, 
                    but also because his mother connived at identifying the city as the familyʼs continuous residence prior to her husbandʼs death and the move to <span class="placeName-ANTWERP">Antwerp</span>. 
                    She had strong motives to suppress the familyʼs associations with <span class="placeName-SIEGEN">Siegen</span>, since exposure of the scandal of her husbandʼs love affair 
                    would have disastrously damaged her familyʼs fortunes. The house in <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span> that was marked 
                    for tourists as the birthplace was the <span class="placeName-building-GRONSFELDERHOF">Gronsfelder Hof</span>, no. 10, in the <span class="placeName-STERNENGASSE">Sternengasse</span>, a mansion that was also known for providing a refuge for

                    <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> painted this harrowing work for the high altar of the church in which he was probably confirmed as a boy, and in which his father was entombed. 
                    In the picture, <span class="persName-STPETER">Peter</span> is martyred by being nailed by his feet and hands while being hung upside down on a cross. 
                    While the personal connections were compelling for <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>, with <span class="persName-STPETER">Peter</span>ʼs upside‐down cross effectively pointing at his fatherʼs tomb, 
                    the commission came from the collector, <span class="persName-EVJIV">Everhard Jabach IV</span>, who was interested more in creating an epitaph 
                        for his own father. A tradition relayed by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, therefore, that <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> 
                        “bequeathed . . . [the altarpiece] at his death to his native city”

                        Along with any personal significance the subject may have held for <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>, artistic fame was also connected with the subject, 
                        which had prompted competition among painters in the sixteenth and the earlier seventeenth centuries

                    The upside‐down crucifixion of <span class="persName-STPETER">Peter</span> was the subject also of <span class="persName-MAA">Michelangelo</span>ʼs last painting,

                        in particular, although his appraisal of <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> overall gradually rose in estimation. 
                    In <span class="title-book-REYNOLDSJOURNEY"><i>A Journey to Flanders and Holland</i></span> (<span class="date-1797">1797</span>), <span class="persName-">Reynolds</span> 
                    acknowledged that <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> expressed “his own approbation of this picture”, which was “painted a little time 
                    before <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>ʼs death”, and which the painter declared “the best he ever painted”. Thanks to this comment, 
                    the painting held “great fame”, <span class="persName-">Reynolds</span> admitted, and he traveled from <span class="placeName-DUSSELDORF">Düsseldorf</span> to <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span> 
                    “on purpose to see it; but it by no means recompenced us for our journey”, for he considered parts of the figure “ill drawn, or rather in a bad taste of drawing”. 
                    “Many parts of this picture are so feebly drawn, and with so tame a pencil, that I cannot help suspecting that <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> died before he had cmpleted it, 
                    and that it was finished by some of his scholars” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#REYNOLDSWORKS1797" target="_self">Reynolds, <span class="title-book-REYNOLDSWORKS1797"><i>Works</i></span> [<span class="date-1797">1797</span>]</a>, 2:111). 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> appears unacquainted with this opinion; and indeed, the Ruskins may have been responding primarily to the fame bestowed on the painting 
                        by <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>ʼs own assessment of it. Another influence besides traditions presented to tourists was changing taste: 
                    the huge flow of Old Master paintings into <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span> during the Napoleonic era had shifted taste from neoclassicism 
                    to “the warmth and colour of Venetian, Dutch, and Flemish masters”

                    (MS IX; <i>Works</i> [1903])—</b>In British criticism of <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>, a foundation was laid by <span class="persName-JRE">Jonathan Richardson</span> (<span class="date-1667-1745">1667–1745</span>) 
                    in the <span class="title-book-RICHARDSONTHEORYOFPAINTING"><i>Essay on the Theory of Painting</i></span> (<span class="date-1715">1715</span>), 
                    in which <span class="persName-JRE">Richardson</span> followed the French critic, <span class="persName-RDP">Roger de Piles</span> (<span class="date-1635-1709">1635–1709</span>), in assessing <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> in terms of the persistent academic debate over the merits of color versus line, 
                    personalized as the <i>rubenistes</i> versus the <i>poussinistes</i>, although <span class="persName-JRE">Richardson</span> listed <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> as a master in both categories. 
                    <span class="persName-SJR">Joshua Reynolds</span> (<span class="date-1723-1792">1723–92</span>), in the <span class="title-book-REYNOLDSDISCOURSES"><i>Discourses</i></span> 
                    (<span class="date-1769-1790">1769–90</span>), frames his discussion in the same terms of <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> versus <span class="persName-NP">Poussin</span>, but he finds <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> wanting both in composition and coloring. 
                    In composition, <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span> asserts in Discourse 5, his “art is too apparent”, his figures exhibiting “expression” and “energy”, but lacking “simplicity and dignity”; and in coloring, there is 
                    “too much of what we call tinted”. In what perhaps comes closest in the <span class="title-book-REYNOLDSDISCOURSES"><i>Discourses</i></span> to the criticism relayed by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in <span class="title-essay-">“Cologne”</span>, <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span> believes that, 
                    in the “higher walks of painting” (i.e., history and religious painting), <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> failed in a “nicety of distinction and elegance of mind”. 
                    Despite these detractions, <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span> regarded <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>ʼs work overall as “a remarkable instance of the same mind being seen in all the various parts of the art” 
                    so that “whilst his works continue before us, . . . his deficiencies are fully supplied”.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">In <span class="date-1781">1781</span>, when <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span> took a tour of the <span class="placeName-LOWCOUNTRIES">Low Countries</span>, his estimation of <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> was raised by observing more of the painterʼs work. 
                    The change is summarized in <span class="title-essay-REYNOLDSRUBENS">“Character of Rubens”</span>, an essay within <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span>ʼs notes from the tour, which were 
                    published posthumously as <span class="title-book-REYNOLDSJOURNEY"><i>A Journey to Flanders and Holland</i></span> (<span class="date-1797">1797</span>). The “Character of Rubens” begins by challenging criticism 
                    with “the works of men of genius”, in which “great faults are united with great beauties”. As in Discourse 5, 
                    <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span> understands <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> according to “the genius which prevails and illuminates the whole”, but 
                    the English critic goes on to develop his ideas oppositely to the young <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs, for now he finds: “It is only in large compositions that his [<span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>ʼs] 
                    powers seem to have room to expand themselves. . . . His superiority is not seen in easel pictures”—the more intimate scale preferred by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>. 
                    <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>ʼs best works, <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span> goes on, 
                    “flow with a freedom and prodigality, as if they cost him nothing”. Respecting the traditional contest between color and line, <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span> reflects <span class="persName-JRE">Richardson</span>ʼs assessment by placing <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> high in both categories: 
                    “The striking brilliancy of his colours, and their lively opposition to each other, the flowing liberty and freedom of his outline, and animated pencil, 
                    with which every object is touched, all contribute to awaken and keep alive the attention of the spectator”. Thus, a view that in the <span class="title-book-REYNOLDSDISCOURSES"><i>Discourses</i></span> was offered as 
                    a concession, now reads as an inevitability: <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> achieves “the complete uniformity in all the parts of the work”, 
                    a unity that seems to “grow out of one mind”. The “confidence” of that mind places <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> above rules, which are “subject to his control”, 
                    rather than he being “himself subject to the rules”. His “originality of manner” can therefore “be truly said to have extended the limits of the art”.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Even in the <span class="title-essay-REYNOLDSRUBENS">“Character of Rubens”</span>, however, <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span> admits to some shortcomings 
                        in <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>ʼs “excellencies, which would have perfectly united with his style”, and this list of failings 
                    possibly corresponds to some of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs comments in <span class="title-essay-">“Cologne”</span>. 
                    In the figures, <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span> finds wanting a “poetical conception of character”; and in his “representations of the highest characters 
                    in the christian or the fabulous world, . . . the spectator finds little more than mere mortals, such as he meets with every day”

                    <span class="geogName-RHAETIANALPS">Rhaetian Alps</span> as extending “from the sources of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> to the 
                    <span class="geogName-DREIHERRENSPITZE">Dreyherrn‐Spitz [Dreiherrenspitze]</span>, east of the valley of the <span class="geogName-ADIGE">Adige</span>, 
                    about 80 miles”, and including five major passes with good carriage roads at that time, from the <span class="geogName-SANBERNARDINOPASS">San Bernardino</span> to the 
                    <span class="geogName-BRENNER">Brenner</span> (<a href="/notes/bibliography#PENNYCYCLOPAEDIA" target="_self"><span class="title-dictionary-PENNYCYCLOPAEDIA"><i>Penny Cyclopædia</i></span></a>, 1:388–89). 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was probably thinking of the western segment of this arc, which lay in the eastern cantons of modern <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span>; and among the sources of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>, 
                    he probably had in mind the <span class="geogName-HINTERRHEIN">Hinterrhein</span>, a tributary that flows through the valley of the <span class="geogName-RHEINWALD">Rheinwald</span> in the 
                    <span class="geogName-GRISONS">Swiss canton of Graubünden (Grisons)</span>. (<span class="persName-WBI">William Brockedon</span> refers to the <span class="geogName-GRISONS">Grisons</span> as “modern <span class="placeName-RHAETIA">Rhætia</span>” in

                  <div class="p">The <span class="geogName-HINTERRHEIN">Hinterrhein</span> flows through the dramatic gorge, the <span class="geogName-VIAMALA">Via Mala</span>,

                    where the river first takes on the name of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>, thence flowing north toward <span class="geogName-LAKECONSTANCE">Lake Constance</span>. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, approaching from the north, 
                    learned to regard the <span class="geogName-RHINEFALLS">Rhine Falls</span> below <span class="placeName-CONSTANCE">Konstanz</span>, near <span class="placeName-SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</span>, as the gateway to the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>. 
                    In <span class="date-1833">1833</span>, the family proceeded south through the <span class="geogName-VIAMALA">Via Mala</span>, 
                    and turned aside from the <span class="geogName-HINTERRHEIN">Hinterrhein</span> to enter <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> via the <span class="geogName-SPLUGEN">Splügen Pass</span>, descending to <span class="placeName-CHIAVENNA">Chiavenna</span> and <span class="geogName-LAKECOMO">Lake Como</span>. 
                    Had they continued westward along the <span class="geogName-HINTERRHEIN">Hinterrhein</span> through the <span class="geogName-RHEINWALD">Rheinwald</span>, instead of taking the <span class="geogName-SPLUGEN">Splügen Pass</span>, 
                    they would have entered <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> through the <span class="geogName-SANBERNARDINOPASS">San Bernardino Pass</span>, and descended to <span class="placeName-BELLINZONA">Bellinzona</span> and <span class="geogName-LAKEMAGGIORE">Lake Maggiore</span>.
