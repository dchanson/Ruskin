                    “But enough / Ive treated of the clouds”; instead, he retains the end of the original line, but changes the verb tense—from 
                    “skiddaw come” to “Skiddaw came”—and runs this phrase into <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs following line,

                    itself rather than forming a part of the poem (see <a href="/notes/editorial_rationale_note#METAMARKS" target="_self">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology: Element, Attribute, and Value Usage—Metamarks</a>); 
                    alternatively, the text possibly represents <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs

                    The deleted line does not appear in the play as fair‐copied, but one can imagine it spoken by one of the French characters. The fair copy of the play 
                    appears along with the fair copy of the poem, <a href="/witnesses/on_skiddaw_and_derwent_water_msv" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATERMSV">“On Skiddaw and Derwent Water”</span></a>,
