               <div class="p"><b>“Papas leaving home was a moment of sorrow / because he was not to come back to‐morrow / 
                    but we thought that the whole was a travel and now / he might come back in days” (<span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span>)—</b>Read as a commentary on real life, 
                    the poem means that <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> has departed on a business journey that is not a dayʼs commute, 
                    such as Papaʼs early‐morning departure for <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> at the start of 
                    <a href="/witnesses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_msi" target="_self"><span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I”</span></a>, 
                    but that is a longer “travel” through the country, collecting orders for wine from clients. However, the second couplet suggests, 
                    plans have changed, and he may return home in a matter of days instead of weeks. None of the extant letters between <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> 
                    for <span class="date-1816-1827">1826–27</span> suggest an unexpected curtailment of a business trip.
