                    (<span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span>, <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>)—During the <a href="/notes/tour_of_1828_note" target="_self">Tour of <span class="date-1828">1828</span></a>, 
                    when the Ruskin family crossed from <span class="placeName-PORTSMOUTH">Portsmouth</span> to the <span class="placeName-ISLEOFWIGHT">Isle of Wight</span>, 
                    they could see the “place where <span class="name--ROYALGEORGE">royal george sunk</span>,” as Ruskin noted in his 
                    <a href="/apparatuses/travel_itinerary_and_tour_notes_1828_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manual_guide-JRTRAVELITINERARY1828">Travel Itinerary and Tour Notes [<span class="date-1828">1828</span>]</span></a>. 
                    The wreck from this disaster, which occurred in <span class="date-1782">1782</span>, remained a danger in the shipping channel until divers were organized in <span class="date-1839-1844">1839-44</span> to salvage 
                    remains (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MURRAYSHANDBOOKISLEOFWIGHT1888" target="_self"><i>Handbook for Travellers in Surrey, Hampshire, and the Isle of Wight</i></a>, 211–12). 
                    In his poem, Ruskin imagines the ship in its prime, her “huge sails” destined to play “a traitor’s part” in the future.<br/>
                    
                    This disaster remained famous throughout the nineteenth century, with accounts framed in terms of nationalistic pride and grief. 
                    An early account, as <span class="persName-HGV">Helen Viljoen</span> notes, is included in 
                    <span class="title-book-PENNANTJOURNEY"><i>A Journey from London to the Isle of Wight</i></span> (<span class="date-1801">1801</span>) 
                    by <span class="persName-TPNATURALIST">Thomas Pennant</span> (<span class="date-1726-1798">1726–98</span>). In 17xx, 
                    when crossing to the <span class="placeName-ISLEOFWIGHT">Isle of Wight</span>, <span class="persName-TPNATURALIST">Pennant</span> beheld “the melancholy sight of the top-masts of the <span class="name--ROYALGEORGE"><i>Royal George</i></span>,” 
                    once deemed “the best sailer in the navy,” which, “before she grew old, carried the heaviest metal; . . . the tallest masts and squarest canvas of any <i>English</i> 
                    built ship in the service. She was coveted by every Admiral, and therefore was engaged in more actions than any other.” Pennant attributes the loss to “the zeal of the spirited 
                    Admiral for returning with all possible speed to the service of his country,” leading to reckless navigation that caused the ship to capsize, taking the lives of 
                    “four hundred seamen, and about the same number of women and children, who had taken the opportunity of the inactive state of the ship, to visit their friends” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#PENNANTJOURNEY" target="_self">Pennant, <i>A Journey from London to the Isle of Wight</i></a>, 2:154-55). 
                    Blame is also suppressed in a poem by <span class="persName-WCP">William Cowper</span> (<span class="date-1731-1800">1731–1800</span>), 
                    <span class="title-poem-COWPERROYALGEORGE">“On the Loss of the Royal George”</span>, written circa 1782-83 to the tune of a march by <span class="persName-GFH">Handel</span>, 
                    a popular setting that Ruskin may have heard (<a href="/notes/bibliography#COWPERPOEMS" target="_self">Cowper, <i>Poems</i>, ed. Baird and Ryskamp</a>, 2:16–17, 311–12).</span><br><br>
