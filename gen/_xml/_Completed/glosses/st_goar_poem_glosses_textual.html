                  <div class="p"><b>Blank space on page for section title and possible drawing (<span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>)—</b>Since the first line of this poem is placed significantly below 
                    the top of the page, leaving a vertical column measuring approximately eleven lines of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs cursive copperplate script, 
                    it is reasonable to assume that he intended to paste a drawing here, but never produced it, or that he produced a drawing, but it has been removed or lost.
                    Most likely, he never produced the drawing at all, since this is the first section of the travelogue to lack even a section heading. The heading <span class="title-composite-">“St Goar”</span> 
                    is supplied without comment in the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 2:359), 
                    but it is placed in square brackets here since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs intention can only be inferred (see <a href="/notes/title_citation_note" target="_self">The System of Title Citation for Works</a>. 
                    In this instance, the inference is very strong, since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> entitled the poem <span class="title-poem-JRSTGOAR">“St Goar”</span> in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG2">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span>; 
                    and this title was maintained as a subtitle for the version of the poem as revised for <span class="title-poem-JRFRAGMENTS">“Fragments from a Metrical Journal”</span>.</div></span><br><br>

                    <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> relegates to an endnote the version of the <span class="title-poem-JRSTGOAR">poem</span>ʼs text as found in both

                    While this version cannot strictly be understood as having authority separated from its companion text <span class="title-poem-JRANDERNACHT">“Andernacht”</span> 
                    forming the <span class="title-poem-JRFRAGMENTS">“Fragments”</span>, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs choice 
                    was in keeping with his preference for published versions (albeit a preference he did not consistently follow) 
                    (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS4D1891" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS4D1891"><i>Poems</i></span> [4<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>]</a>, 1:266–67;

                    <a href="/notes/library_edition_note" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span></a>, the editors followed suit, reproducing the 
                    <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> version as main copytext as well, 
                    while dropping the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>/<span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> version into a note.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">The title applied by all these editors to the earlier version, “First Sketch of ‘St. Goar’”, is properly placed in square brackets since <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> 
                    invented it (see <a href="/notes/title_citation_note" target="_self">System for Title Citation of Works</a>). The title is misleading in calling the earlier version a 
                    “first sketch”, since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not substantively alter the poem when he fair‐copied it in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> 
                    from its earliest surviving draft in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG2">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span>; and at that time, he did not anticipate revising this version to form part of 
                    <span class="title-poem-JRFRAGMENTS">“Fragments”</span> for publication in <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span>. 
                    For <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>, however, use of the term <i>sketch</i> was implicitly justified by his rationale for printing the earlier version in a note: 
                    “as in the case of [<a href="/witnesses/andernacht_poem_poems_1891" target="_self">“First Sketch of <span class="title-poem-JRANDERNACHT">‘Andernach’</span>”</a>], 
                    it may be interesting to compare the first draft; if for nothing else, to show that the young poet could polish when he chose, and that he would have eliminated the slipshod 
                    grammar and faulty rhymes if he had prepared the rest of his juvenile verses for publication” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS4D1891" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS4D1891"><i>Poems</i></span> [4<sup>o</sup>, 1891]</a>, 1:282–83;

                    Intended to bestow faint praise on the “polished” version, these unsupported generalizations are not in fact applicable to the relation between what <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> 
                    calls the “sketch” and the “polished” published versions. While the latter is more condensed, the first version of 
                    <span class="title-poem-JRSTGOAR">“St Goar”</span> is a carefully considered exercise in the contrasting modes of the sublime and the beautiful.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">The <span class="title-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> reprinted this careless commentary by <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> without challenge, only adding some bibliographical details

                        poetry texts from the annuals and of course lacked access to manuscripts or the information needed to make a connection between <span class="title-poem-FRAGMENTS">“Fragments from a Metrical Journal”</span> and
