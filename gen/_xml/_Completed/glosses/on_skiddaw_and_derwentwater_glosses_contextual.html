                        as applied to travel narrative. The description is also Romantic in its inquiry into the psychology of viewing the prospect.

                                    and greatly detached from the simple act of vision. The eye is, by itself, and without some objects to
                                    form a comparison, unable to judge of such heights at such a distance. [The Welsh mountains]

                                    with the present view, is partly the mysterious idea of aweful and inaccessible remoteness attached

                    but digs at <span class="placeName-HERCULANEUM">Herculaneum</span> were renewed in <span class="date-1828">1828</span>, and extended through the period of the composition, revision, and publication 
                    of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem. Earlier excavations at <span class="placeName-HERCULANEUM">Herculaneum</span> had consisted mainly in tunneling, removing antiquities, and backfilling, so that there was little 
                    to be seen of the city structures apart from the amphitheater. The renewed excavations were aimed at laying bare structures and spaces 
                    such as what tourists were accustomed to viewing at <span class="placeName-POMPEII">Pompeii</span>. Thus, in <span class="date-1829-1830">1829–30</span>, <span class="placeName-HERCULANEUM">Herculaneum</span> was prominent in the news; 
                    and since the reference to the site occurs only in lines added to the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span> version of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, 
                    the idea probably originated with <span class="persName-EA">Edward Andrews</span>, who as a classicist would have been interested in the antiquities, which included a library of papyrus rolls 
                    found at <span class="placeName-HERCULANEUM">Herculaneum</span>, raising hopes of finding lost classical texts.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">In English literature, these treasures, along with the imagined drama of the disaster that buried the cities, were themes of poems

                        the apocalyptic light surrounding the reference in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem probably reflects popular narratives of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span> that 
                    invented a Christian community living in <span class="placeName-HERCULANEUM">Herculaneum</span> and <span class="placeName-POMPEII">Pompeii</span> at the time of the disaster. According to these stories, 
                    a Christian sect imbued with the “purity” of the primitive church was rescued from the Vesuvian punishment 
                    meted out to the pagan civilization for its decadence and stubborn refusal of the Christian call. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem was too early to have been influenced 
                    by the most popularly succcessful of these narratives, <span class="title-book-BULWERLYTTONLASTDAYSOFPOMPEII"><i>The Last Days of Pompeii</i></span> by <span class="persName-EBL">Edward Bulwer‐Lytton</span>, 
                    which the Ruskins probably acquired in the first year of its publication, <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, but predecessors to the novel advanced the Christian theme. 
                    In one form, romances pretended to be derived from the charred scrolls discovered at <span class="placeName-HERCULANEUM">Herculaneum</span>. A tale in this genre was authored later in the <span class="date-1835-1839">1830s</span>
