                    described the view from the botanical garden on the castle grounds: “the travellerʼs vision embraces one of the most exquisite views in <span class="geogName-EUROPE">Europe</span>.

                    with the surrounding plain; and it is only when the eye has wandered amongst the dark objects which intersect the valley in every direction, 
                    that it again detects in the distance the silvery thread, gracefuly winding till it is lost in the ample <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> at <span class="placeName-MANNHEIM">Mannheim</span>.

                    and gradually leading above the tops of those which grow on the hill‐side, till at length the level space behind the castle and in front of the great gateway is reached; 
                    the other is by a steep flight of steps into the very heart of the fortress, through a vast, subterranean, vaulted hall. . . . Take which route you will, 
                    there is no danger of the highest‐wrought expectations being disappointed. By the first, you will wind round the base of towers, which look as if a giant architect 
                    had reared them for a giant prince . . .  and both lead to a terrace, from whence a view is seen, so much beyond what the power of words can paint, 
                    that all the most faithful traveller can say, to any purpose, on the subject is, ‘Go, all, with as little delay as possible, and look at it.’ . . . 
                    On reaching the esplanade, before the chief entrance, you have no very extended view; for the lofty summit of the <span class="geogName-GEISSBERG">Geissberg</span> is on one side,

                    <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span> maintained a series of fortresses. 
                    On another border, <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span> was threatened by the German Hapsburgs via the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> and <span class="geogName-MOSELLE">Moselle</span> valleys.

                        the <span class="date-1667-1668">War of Devolution</span> (<span class="date-1667-1668">1667–68</span>), <span class="persName-KL14">Louis</span> had laid claim to parts of the <span class="placeName-SPANISHNETHERLANDS">Spanish Netherlands</span> on the grounds that these holdings had “devolved” 
                    on his Spanish queen. To the immediate north of the <span class="placeName-SPANISHNETHERLANDS">Spanish Netherlands</span>, the <span class="placeName-DUTCHREPUBLIC">Dutch Republic</span> became alarmed by <span class="persName-KL14">Louis</span>ʼs aggression; 
                        and although the <span class="placeName-DUTCHREPUBLIC">Republic</span> had been warring with the English navy, broke off that contest to sign a treaty with <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span> and <span class="placeName-SWEDEN">Sweden</span>, forming a Triple Alliance (<span class="date-1688">1668</span>). 
                    <span class="persName-KL14">Louis</span> regarded this alliance as a betrayal by the <span class="placeName-DUTCHREPUBLIC">Republic</span>, which had stood as a longtime ally against the Hapsburg power in <span class="placeName-SPANISHNETHERLANDS">Spanish Netherlands</span>; 
                    and therefore, he avenged himself by launching the <span class="date-1672-1678">Dutch War</span> directly against the <span class="placeName-DUTCHREPUBLIC">Republic</span>ʼs territory. 
                        Meanwhile, he undermined the Triple Alliance of <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>, the <span class="placeName-DUTCHREPUBLIC">Dutch Republic</span>, 
                        and <span class="placeName-SWEDEN">Sweden</span> by making a secret treaty with the king of <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>, <span class="persName-KC2">Charles II</span> (<span class="date-1630-1685">1630–85</span>). 
                    For this reason, English troops joined in the French assault on the Dutch, including the young

                        Although the English Parliament forced <span class="persName-KC2">Charles II</span> to make peace with the <span class="placeName-DUTCHREPUBLIC">Dutch Republic</span> in <span class="date-1674">1674</span>, motivated both by mercantile interests and by sympathy for Protestant <span class="placeName-HOLLAND">Holland</span>, 
                    some English troops under <span class="persName-JCDM">Churchill</span>ʼs command remained with the French, and they joined with the army led by <span class="persName-TURENNE">Turenne</span>,

                    But <span class="persName-KL14">Louis</span> met resistance in the region from <span class="persName-LGCF">Leopold I</span>, who was allied with the Dutch, and who 
                        turned Imperial forces against <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span>. Meanwhile, the German Protestant <span class="placeName-PALATINATE">Palatinate</span>, which <span class="persName-CJRM">Mazarin</span> had drawn to the French side against the <span class="placeName-HOLYROMANEMPIRE">Empire</span>, 
                    was turning against <span class="persName-KL14">Louis</span> and his armies owing to <span class="persName-TURENNE">Turenne</span>ʼs occupation of the region between the <span class="geogName-NECKAR">Neckar</span> and the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>. 
                    In <span class="date-1674-06">June 1674</span>, <span class="persName-TURENNE">Turenne</span> led a battle against Imperial forces up to the gates of <span class="placeName-building-HEIDELBERGCASTLE">Heidelberg</span>, the seat of the Elector of the <span class="placeName-PALATINATE">Palatinate</span>. 
                    In the summer months following, he laid waste to the <span class="geogName-NECKAR">Neckar</span> valley, pillaging to supply his troops, and burning villages that refused to cooperate

                        <span class="persName-KW3">William of Orange and Stadtholder</span> of the <span class="placeName-DUTCHREPUBLIC">Dutch Republic</span>, supplanted his father‐in‐law, <span class="persName-KJ2">James II</span>,

                    The objective was to prevent an enemy army from being able to support itself in the region. This brutal destruction was not unique in <span class="persName-KL14">Louis</span>ʼs wars, 
                    but “the devastation of the <span class="placeName-PALATINATE">Palatinate</span> . . . burned itself into the European conscience”, and became,
                    according to a modern historian, “one of the influences that inspired Europeans to try to make the conduct of war more restrained and humane in the eighteenth century”

                        <span class="date-1836">1836</span> guidebook description of the repeated attacks leading to the <span class="placeName-building-HEIDELBERGCASTLE">castle</span>ʼs ruin: 
                        “In <span class="date-1674">1674</span>, the Elector, <span class="persName-CL1">Charles Louis</span> [<span class="date-1617-1680">1617–80</span>], incurred the displeasure of <span class="persName-KL14">Louis XIV</span>; and a French army, under <span class="persName-TURENNE">Turenne</span>, was in consequence let loose 
                    upon the <span class="placeName-PALATINATE">Palatinate</span>, carrying slaughter and desolation before them. <span class="persName-CL1">The Elector</span> beheld with distress, from the castle in which he had shut himself up, 
                    the inroads of foreign troops, and flame and smoke rising up along the plain from burning towns and villages. Unable to oppose the French with equal force 
                    at the head of an army, but anxious to avenge the wrongs of his country, he resolved, in a spirit which some may deem Quixotic, others chivalrous, 
                    to endeavour to end the contest with his own sword; and accordingly he sent a cartel to <span class="persName-TURENNE">Marshal Turenne</span>, challenging him to single combat. 
                    The French general returned a civil answer, hut did not accept it. The ambition of <span class="persName-KL14">Louis XIV</span> led him, on the death of the <span class="persName-CL1">Elector</span>, to lay claim to the <span class="placeName-PALATINATE">Palatinate</span> 
                    on behalf of [his younger brother,] the <span class="persName-P1DO">Duke of Orleans</span> [<span class="date-1640-1701">1640–1701</span>, whose second marriage was to the daughter of Elector <span class="persName-CL1">Charles Louis</span>], 
                    and another French army, more wicked than the first, was marched across the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>. 
                        <span class="placeName-HEIDELBERG">Heidelberg</span> was taken and burnt, <span class="date-1688">1688</span> [the onset of the <span class="date-1688-1697">Nine Yearsʼ War</span>], by <span class="persName-EDM">[Compte de] Mélac</span> [<span class="date-1630-1704">1630–1704</span>], a general whose brutality and cruelty surpassed that 
                        of <span class="persName-JT">[the Count of] Tilly</span> [<span class="date-1559-1632">1559–1632</span>, known for the sacking and massacre of the Protestant German city of <span class="placeName-MAGDEBURG">Magdeburg</span> in <span class="date-1631">1631</span>, during the <span class="date-1618-1648">Thirty Yearsʼ War</span>]. 
                    But it was at the following siege under <span class="persName-NBM">[the Marquis de] Chamilly</span> [<span class="date-1636-1715">1636–1715</span>], in <span class="date-1693">1693</span>, that it was reserved for the French to display the most merciless tyranny, 
                    and practise excesses worthy of fiends rather than men, upon the town and its inhabitants, paralleled only in the <span class="date-1789-1799">French Revolution</span>, 
                    and which will ever render the name of Frenchman odious in the <span class="placeName-PALATINATE">Palatinate</span>. The castle was betrayed through the cowardice or treachery of the governor, 
                    with the garrison, and many of the townspeople who had fled to it for refuge. The cruelty of the treatment they met with was, in this instance, 
                    heightened by religious intolerance, and no mercy was shown to the Protestants. On this occasion <span class="placeName-building-HEIDELBERGCASTLE">the castle</span> was entirely destroyed”
