                  <div class="p"><b>Blank space on page for possible drawing (MS IX)—</b>As on the first page of the poem about <span class="placeName-STGOAR">St. Goar</span>, 
                    on the first page of the prose the first line is placed significantly below the top of the page, leaving a vertical column measuring approximately nine lines 
                    of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs cursive copperplate script. It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that he intended to paste a drawing here, 
                    but never produced it, or that he produced a drawing, but it has been removed or lost. At this juncture between the poem and prose account of <span class="placeName-STGOAR">St. Goar</span>, 
                    the <a href="/notes/library_edition_note" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span></a> erroneously situates 
                    “a sketch of a town in a large plain, with distant mountains.” This drawing is affixed to p. 44v, not 43v, on which the prose account of <span class="placeName-STGOAR">St. Goar</span> begins. 
                    The editors also erroneously state that, “at this point” in MS VIII, the “rough draft” presents the untitled prose piece beginning 
                    <a href="/witnesses/it_was_a_wide_and_stretchy_sweep_prose_msviii" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-JRITWASAWIDESTRETCHYSWEEP">“It was a wide and stretchy sweep”</span></a>
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 2:360 n. 1). In MS VIII, this piece is drafted 
                    on p. 62r, separated by ten pages and drafts of eight other items, from the prose section on “<span class="placeName-STGOAR">St. Goar</span>,” which appears on p. 56v (see
