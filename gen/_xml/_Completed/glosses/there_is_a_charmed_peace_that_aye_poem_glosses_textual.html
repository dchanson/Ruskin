               <div class="p"><b>Title with epigraph, “The Alps from Schaffhausen”; and title, “Entrance to Schaffhausen” 
                    (<i>Poems</i> [<span class="date-1891">1891</span>]; <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span> [<span class="date-1903">1903</span>])—</b><span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> gave the title 
                    <span class="title-poem-JRALPSFROMSSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">“The Alps from Schaffhausen”</span> to the poem that begins with the line, 
                    “There is a charmed peace that aye”, which is untitled in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft, the sole surviving text. 
                    He failed to signal this editorial intervention by surrounding his title with square brackets; instead, confusingly, in his reconstruction he preceded this poem with another, 
                    which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did entitle in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft (again, the sole surviving text) as 
                    <a href="/witnesses/schaffhausen_poem_msviii" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">“Schaffhausen”</span></a>, 
                    yet which <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> renamed “Entrance to Schaffhausen”. <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> did at least, in this instance, indicate his intervention 
                    by enclosing the editorial title in square brackets.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs rationale for his retitling is evident in the epigraph he added to 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRALPSFROMSSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">[“The Alps from Schaffhausen”]</span>, which he took from 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs autobiography, <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>. 
                        He expected the reader to approach the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> as documentary evidence for the revelatory 
                        Pisgah sight that structures the autobiographical account. As he commented in a note appended to <span class="title-poem-JRSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">“Schaffhausen” [“Entrance to Schaffhausen”]</span>, 
                        the poems are “worth comparing” with the autobiographyʼs narrative as “two accounts” composed “at an interval of more than fifty years apart, 
                        the one in verse and the other in prose”, describing the familyʼs first sighting of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> from <span class="placeName-SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</span>—the later prose version, 
                        he added, being distinguished by “a power of recollective imagination resembling that of <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS4D1891" target="_self"><i>Poems</i> [4<sup>o</sup>, 1891]</a>, 1:283;

                        (In the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>, the quotations in <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs epigraph 
                        are dropped into notes [<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><i>Works</i></a>, 2:366–67].)</div>
               
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> does not explicitly identify the town of <span class="placeName-SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</span> in the body of either of these poems, 
                        but <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs assumption is supported by the poemsʼ details, which, as the contextual notes explain, 
                        correspond to touristsʼ experience of <span class="placeName-SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</span> and its enviorons in the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>, 
                        as described in guidebooks and travel accounts, including the <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFT48" target="_self">1833 diary</a> kept by 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs cousin, <a href="/notes/richardson_mary_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span></a>. 
                        More direct textual evidence for identification of place corresponding to <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs assignment of titles lies in <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span>ʼs 
                        <a href="/witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii" target="_self"><span class="title-bibliography_text-JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan for Continuation of the “Account”</span></a>, 
                        which lists one section heading as <span class="title-composite-JRSCHAFFHAUSENCOMP">“Schaffhausen”</span>, though not two corresponding to <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs 
                        elaborated titles for the two poems.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">If it is possible to situate either or both of these poems in <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span>ʼs 
                        <a href="/witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii" target="_self"><span class="title-bibliography_text-JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan</span></a>, 
                        they likely belonged under one of three proposed section headings: <span class="title-composite-JRSCHAFFHAUSENCOMP">“Schaffhausen”</span>, 
                        <span class="title-composite-JRTHEALPSCOMP">“The Alps”</span>, and <span class="title-composite-JRTHEFALLOFTHERHINECOMP">“The <span class="geogName-">fall of the Rhine</span>”</span>. 
                        We have no definitive way of knowing where among these composite sections <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> might have placed these two poems about <span class="placeName-SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</span>. 
                        The most straightforward approach is to assume that <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span> destined the poem he entitled <span class="title-poem-JRSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">“Schaffhausen”</span> in draft 
                        for the composite section of the same title, <span class="title-composite-JRSCHAFFHAUSENCOMP">“Schaffhausen”</span>, in the <span class="title-bibliography_text-JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan</span>; 
                        and there is less direct, but still solid grounds for connecting <span class="title-poem-JRALPSFROMSSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">“There is a charmed peace that aye” [“The Alps from Schaffhausen”]</span> 
                        with the section listed in the <span class="title-bibliography_text-JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan</span> as <span class="title-composite-JRTHEALPSCOMP">“The Alps”</span>, 
                        since <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem contains echoes of lines from the poem of that title by <span class="persName-SR">Samuel Rogers</span>, 
                        <span class="title-poem-">“The Alps”</span>.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">That said, the positions that the two draft poems would likely have occupied in <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="title-bibliography_text-JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan</span> 
                        are not distorted by <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs invented titles and their arrangement in his all‐verse version of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>. 
                        The poem <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> entitled <span class="title-poem-JRSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">“Schaffhausen”</span>, while compositionally falling later in <span class="title-manuscript-">MS VIII</span> (70v) than the other poem (56v–57v), 
                        corresponds to the section named <span class="title-composite-JRSCHAFFHAUSENCOMP">“Schaffhausen”</span>, which comes first in <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span>ʼs 
                        <span class="title-bibliography_text-JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan</span>, followed immediately by the section named <span class="title-composite-JRTHEALPSCOMP">“The Alps”</span>. 
                        Indeed, <span class="title-poem-JRSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">“Schaffhausen”</span> reads like an alternate opening to <span class="title-poem-JRALPSFROMSCHAFFHAUSEN">“There is a charmed peace, that aye” [“The Alps from Schaffhausen”]</span>, 
                        both beginning on the Sabbath. But while <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> maintains <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span>ʼs intended sequence, the editor, 
                        by designating the lines entitled <span class="title-poem-JRSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">“Schaffhausen”</span> as forming an “entrance” 
                        to <span class="title-composite-JRTHEALPSCOMP">“The Alps”</span>, disguises the contrasting registers that <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span> designed for the two poems. 
                        In <span class="title-poem-JRALPSFROMSCHAFFHAUSEN">“There is a charmed peace, that aye” [“The Alps from Schaffhausen”]</span>, 
                        the lines build up to the cry of discovery, “The <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>,—Full far away / The long successive ranges lay”, 
                        rising to that climax by imaginatively coursing the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>. Thus, this poem seeks the sublime, whereas the fragment <span class="title-poem-JRSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">“Schaffhausen”</span> 
                        traces a stroll to the “summit of the hill”. <span class="title-poem-JRSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">“Schaffhausen”</span> is the start of a domestic complement 
                        to the sublimity of the earlier‐composed, longer piece, with its description of the river driving toward the <span class="geogName-">Rhine Falls</span>, 
                        emphatically pounded in dactylic lines—a contrast to <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span>ʼs usual, amiable flow of iambic octosyllabic verse.</div></span><br><br>
