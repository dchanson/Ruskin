                    she escaped from the castle, an episode that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would later know from <i><span class="title-book-SCOTTABBOT">The Abbot</span></i> (<span class="date-1820">1820</span>)

                    In <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs telling of the story, <span class="persName-MQS">Mary</span> is abetted in her escape by the young page,
