                    owing to the association of the “<span class="geogName-LAKECOMO">Larian Lake</span>”—the ancient name for <span class="geogName-LAKECOMO">Lake Como</span>—with

                    The <span class="placeName-building-VILLAPLINIANA">Villa Pliniana</span> was built on the lakeshore in the sixteenth century around the supposed spring mentioned 
                    by the elder <span class="persName-PLINYELDER">Pliny</span> in the <span class="title-book-PLINYNATURALISHISTORIA"><i>Naturalis Historia</i></span>, 
                    and described at length by the younger <span class="persName-PLINYYOUNGER">Pliny</span> in a letter to <span class="persName-LLSURA">Licinius Sura</span> 
                    (<span class="title-book-PLINYEPISTULAE"><i>Epistulae</i></span>, bk. 4, letter 30): “There is a spring which rises in the mountain, and running among the rocks is received into a little banqueting‐room, 
                    from whence, after being detained a short time, it falls into the <span class="geogName-LARIANLAKE">Larian lake</span>”. <span class="persName-PLINYYOUNGER">Pliny</span> 
                    relishes reclining by the fountain, drinking the cool water and watching the spring “rise and fall by fixed and measured gradations”. He goes on to speculate about the cause 
                    of the intermittent flow (<a href="/notes/bibliography#PLINYLETTERS" target="_self"><span class="persName-PLINYYOUNGER">Pliny the Younger</span>, <span class="title-book-PLINYLETTERS"><i>Letters</i></span></a>, 1:353, 355).

                        In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, not only is the point of <span class="persName-PLINYYOUNGER">Pliny</span>ʼs refinement 
                        missed in the clichés drawn from the vocabulary of the picturesque about the dead underfoot; the poem also perversely fails to look overhead at surroundings that impressed 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs cousin, just as it moved other English visitors, such as <span class="persName-PBS">Percy Shelley</span>. 
                        In <span class="date-1818">1818</span>, <span class="persName-PBS">Shelley</span> wrote to <span class="persName-TLPEACOCK">Thomas Love Peacock</span> about trying to procure the 
                        <span class="placeName-building-VILLAPLINIANA">Villa Pliniana</span> for an extended stay on the lake. As published by <span class="persName-MWS">Mary Shelley</span> 
                        in <span class="date-1840">1840</span>, the letter describes “a magnificent palace, . . . now half in ruins, . . . built upon terraces <i>raised from</i> the bottom 
                        of the lake, together with its garden at the foot of a semicircular precipice, overshadowed by profound forests of <span class="name--CHESTNUT">chestnut</span>. 
                        The scene from the colonnade is the most extraordinary, at once, and the most lovely that eye ever beheld. On one side is the mountain, and immediately over you are clusters of cyprus‐trees 
                        of an astonishing height, which seem to pierce the sky. Above you, from among the clouds, as it were, descends a waterfall of immense size, broken by the woody rocks into a thousand channels to the lake. 
                        On the other side is seen the blue extent of the lake and the mountains, speckled with sails and spires. The apartments of the <span class="placeName-building-VILLAPLINIANA">Pliniana</span> 
                        are immensely large, but ill furnished and antique. The terraces, which overlook the lake, and conduct under the shade of such immense <span class="name--LAUREL">laurel‐trees</span> 
                        as deserve the epithet of <span class="persName-fictional-PYTHIA">Pythian</span>, are most delightful”

               <div class="p">Four years after this poem, in <span class="title-essay-JRPOETRYOFARCHITECTURE1837_38"><i>The Poetry of Architecture</i></span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        clung to the characterization of <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> as “glorious in its death”. Here the picturesque view does rise from the “principal character of 
                        Italian landscape” of melancholy to that of “elevation”; and a word picture traces “small fountains” such as those falling into the “Larian Lake” 
                        to a broader vista of “peak, precipice, and promontory”. Appreciation of such scenes is necessary to the object of these essays, which is the “formation of taste”, 
                        although later in the series Ruskin recurs to <span class="placeName-building-VILLAPLINIANA">Pliniana</span> as an impractical model for the modern English villa, 
                        when built in hill country: “The ﬁrst thing . . . which the architect has to do in hill country is to bring his employer down from heroics to 
                        common sense; to teach him that, although it might be very well for a man like <span class="persName-PLINYYOUNGER">Pliny</span>, whose whole spirit and life was wrapt up in that of Nature, 
                        to set himself down under the splash of a cascade 400 feet high, such escapades are not becoming in English gentlemen; and that it is necessary, for his own satisfaction, 
                        as well as that of others, that he should keep in the most quiet and least pretending corners of the landscape which he has chosen”. (The editors of the 
                        <span class="title-book-JRWORKSKLE">Library Edition</span> corrected these remarks, noting that the <span class="placeName-building-VILLAPLINIANA">Pliniana</span> 
                        “is not . . . on the site of that built by <span class="persName-PLINYYOUNGER">Pliny</span>; it is called after him from an intermittent spring which is asserted to be the one 
                        minutely described by him” in the <span class="title-book-PLINYEPISTULAE"><i>Epistulae</i></span>
