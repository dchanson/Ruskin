               <div class="p">A possible explanation for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs substitution appears later in the poem, at line 64 as fair‐copied in <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">MS RF T70</span> (line 62 as fair‐copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>). 
                        In the draft, <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drafted this later line as “I wish I had not observed the <span class="name--LYRA">lyre</span>”, which he fair‐copied in <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">MS RF T70</span>. The cause for this expression of regret, 
                        one may suppose, is that “<span class="name--LYRA">lyre</span>” rhymes well with “fire” in the preceding line. Thus, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> meant, he wishes he had not already mentioned that constellation earlier, at line 17,
                        since he had need of it now—and yet, he was in fact is using “<span class="name--LYRA">lyre</span>” to make up the rhyme anyway. (The surviving <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> draft is missing the page that would have contained the earlier line, 
                        “After that doth come the <span class="name--LYRA">lyre</span>” [line 17], but there is no reason to suggest that the original draft differed from its fair copy in <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">MS RF T70</span>.) 
                        As with other revisions to the <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span> fair copy, a penciled X (probably by <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>) marks the later line for amendment; 
                        and accordingly, in the margin next to line 64, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> substituted in pencil “then the very frightened <span class="name--LEPUS">hare</span>”. The latter substitution is in turn scored through in pencil; 
                        and below it <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> inserted the text of line 17: “after that doth come the <span class="name--LYRA">lyre</span>”. In other words, at the cost of his jest, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> moved line 17 to replace line 64, 
                        and substituted the <span class="name--LEPUS">hare</span> for the <span class="name--LYRA">lyre</span> at line 17.</div></span><br><br>

                    “antinous and arrow soon / after it the southern crown”; in first fair copy (<span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span>), “soon” deleted and “down” substituted in the margin,

               <div class="p">The adjacent adverbs at the end of line 41 and the beginning of line 42 are problematic, whether read as end‐stopped or as enjambed. 
                        End‐stop is the norm throughout this poem; and in <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span>, the placement of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs substitutions for, respectively, “soon” and “After it” can be viewed 
                        as two separate actions and not a single connected revision resulting in the elided “down far below”. 
                        Considered as end‐stopped lines, the revision of “after it” seems motivated by the disagreement of case 
                        between <i>it</i> and the plural referent, the two constellations <span class="name--ANTINOUSCONSTELLATION">Antinous</span> and <span class="name--SAGITTA">Arrow</span>. 
                        In this scenario, however, the substitution of “down” for “soon” is a perplexing choice, as the adverb appears to make no sense. 
                        The line might be read as meaning that <span class="name--ANTINOUSCONSTELLATION">Antinous</span> and <span class="name--SAGITTA">Arrow</span> are “down” from <span class="name--GRUS">Grus (the Crane)</span> in the line above, 
                        which is factually incorrect—<span class="name--ANTINOUSCONSTELLATION">Antinous</span> and <span class="name--SAGITTA">Arrow</span> are northern constellations, not “down” from the southern constellation <span class="name--GRUS">Grus</span>—but 
                        but this would not be the first time the poem contradicts the map of the sky.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Alternatively, one might speculate that the substitution of “down” for “soon” was occasioned by the substitution of “far below” for “after it”, 
                        creating the enjambed “down far below” as a single adverbial modifier. If the adverb phrase applies to <span class="name--ANTINOUSCONSTELLATION">Antinuous</span> and <span class="name--SAGITTA">Arrow</span>, 
                        however, the lines are made factually incorrect, since these constellations lie in the northern hemisphere—far above, 
                        not below, <a href="#CORONAAUSTRALISGLOSS">“the southern crown”</a> in line 42. If applied to the latter, 
                        the enjambed phrase correctly describes the position of <span class="name--CORONAAUSTRALIS">Corona Australis (the Southern Crown)</span> but leaves <span class="name--ANTINOUSCONSTELLATION">Antinous</span> and <span class="name--SAGITTA">Arrow</span> without any modifier at all, 
                        adverbial or adjectival. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have enjoyed the ambiguity of “down” being pulled two ways—if end‐stoped, 
                        toward <span class="name--ANTINOUSCONSTELLATION">Antinous</span> and <span class="name--SAGITTA">Arrow</span>, although the adverb makes no sense for those constellations; or if enjambed, 
                        toward <span class="name--CORONAAUSTRALIS">Corona Australis</span>, although the defection of the adverb leaves those constellations stranded.</div></span><br><br>

                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> deleted all but the first two words of the four lines 57–60, which he had fair‐copied as drafted in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>: “The <span class="name--LIBRA">scales</span> that nothing to weigh would bear / But yet contain a thousand more / 
                    Farther than that I could not say / More than than the <span class="name--MILKYWAY">milky way</span>” (with “than” doubled in line 60, probably unintentionally, owing to his eye being caught by “than that” in the line above). 
                    The lines were flagged by a diagonal line in the right margin, one supposes because their syntactic inversions obscure their sense. If one rearranges the phrases, the lines do make sense: i.e., 
                    “The scales that would bear to weigh nothing / But yet contain a thousand more [stars] / More than the <span class="name--MILKYWAY">milky way</span> [does] / Farther than that I could not say” (with the caveat that “farther than that” 
                    may be correctly positioned as it stands, if <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intended that phrase to modify “thousand more” rather than the entire utterance of the other three lines). While <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs figure is clever, 
                    playing on the gap between the ineffectual imaginary scales and the immensity of heavenly bodies of which the scales form a part, 
                    one can understand a readerʼs objection to the overburdened syntax.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drafted the revision (“The <span class="name--LIBRA">scales</span> in which twas vainly said /
                        The crimes and virtues of men were weighed”) on the same inside folded sheet, both at the bottom of the sheet, 
                        crossing the fold (1v–2r), and at the top of the folded sheet, to the right of the fold (2r). This revised, substituted couplet is fair‐copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>. 
                        The draft revised lines include the repeated admonishment, “mind mind”, which appears to be <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs reminder to himself to revise, or finish revising, the couplet, rather than a part of the revised lines themselves.</div>
