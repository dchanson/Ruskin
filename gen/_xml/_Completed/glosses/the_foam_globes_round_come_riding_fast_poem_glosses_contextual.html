                    the editors remark that <i>foam globe</i> was "a favourite expression with Ruskin, and they point to instances here and in

                    The editors fail to identify the source of this poetic phrase, however, which was likely <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>ʼs 
                    <span class="title-poem-SCOTTROKEBY"><i>Rokeby</i></span> (<span class="date-1813">1813</span>), 
                    in the description of the vale of the <span class="geogName-GRETA">River Greta</span> in <span class="geogName-DURHAMCOUNTY">County Durham</span>, 
                    near the riverʼs meeting with the <span class="geogName-TEES">River Tees</span>, 
                    between <span class="name--ROKEBYPARK">Rokeby Manor</span> 
                    and <span class="name--MORTHAMTOWER">Mortham Tower</span>. In his apparently initial adoption of the phrase, 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> borrows <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs diction for a rocky, wooded Yorkshire stream and transplants it to open his poem describing the glacier torrent of the 
                    <span class="geogName-ARVERON">Arveyron</span>. He takes both <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs noun for the effervescent foam and the associated verb for its action on the current, 
                    but not <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs moralizing similes:</div>

                    In <span class="date-1813">1813</span>, the year of the poemʼs publication, the young <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> penned a wry account of the narrative to his mother, 
                    <span class="persName-CTWR">Catherine</span>, predicting that it 
                    “will never be much read & I hope the Reviewers will assist in checking the career of such loose & foolish poems. <span class="persName-WS">Mr. Scott</span> 
                    consulted his fame in writing <span class="title-poem-SCOTTMARMION">Marmion</span> & the <span class="title-poem-SCOTTMINSTREL">Minstrel</span>—if 
                    he continues to value his fame he will write no more”. 
                    <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> especially scoffed at the character of <span class="persName-fictional-WILFRIDWYCLIFFE">Wilfrid</span>, a boy who is 
                    “very tender hearted, mild, shy, innocent, amorous, & sickly, very studious moreover”, 
                    and who “prefers sitting up all night hearing the wind howl & looking at the moon” in order to write poems about it, rather than “going like other folks to bed. . . . 
                    I expected the first Canto was to send this weekly youth to his grave in a galloping consumption . . . when lo! & behold he breaks out upon us all at once 
                    with a song & seems as well & merry as possible considering that he had nothing but the moon to sing to & not even a pipe nor a pot of porter to comfort him withall”. 
                    <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> could not have predicted how uncannily the character would conform, two decades later, with that of the young <span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span>
