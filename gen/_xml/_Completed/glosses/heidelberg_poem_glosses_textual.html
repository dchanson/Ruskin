                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs having entitled the second draft installment of the poem as <span class="title-poem-JRCONTIHEIDELBERG">“Continuation Heidelberg”</span>, and bringing this together with its prior (untitled) 
                    draft segment to form most of the fair‐copy poem in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>; and following this, his having also fair‐copied just enough prose in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> to locate its source in an untitled draft segment of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, 
                    with two subsequent prose segments readily identifiable by their contents as belonging together. Yet as in the preceding section of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>, <span class="title-composite-JRSTGOARCOMP">“St. Goar”</span>, 
                    the section on <span class="title-composite-JRHEIDELBERGCOMP">“Heidelberg”</span> lacks a section title in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>. The section title is supplied without comment in the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 2:361), 
                    but the editors should have enclosed the title in square brackets, as here in <i>ERM</i>, since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs intention can only be inferred, albeit with reasonable certainty 
                    (see <a href="/notes/title_citation_note" target="_self">The System of Title Citation for Works</a>). Unlike the start of <span class="title-composite-JRSTGOARCOMP">“St. Goar”</span> in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>, the <span class="title-composite-JRHEIDELBERGCOMP">“Heidelberg”</span> section does begin with a drawing, 
                    if not a title. See the commentary on this drawing, however, regarding its uncertain relevance to the landscape near <span class="placeName-HEIDELBERG">Heidelberg</span>.</div></span><br><br>

                    these eight lines, the draft of the poem in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> (which is divided between 66v–67r and 69r–70v) begins with the second quartet, 
                    starting with the line “Smiling with those bright rays kiss”. The first quartet, starting with the line “From behind a thunder cloud”, first appears in the 
                    <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy, not in draft. In the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>, 
                    the editors drop these eight lines into a note, incorrectly attributing them—all eight of them—to <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>. 
                    The latter confusion probably arose from <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> having omitted the lines—again, all eight of them—from the poem as printed in 
                    <i>Poems</i> (<span class="date-1891">1891</span>), leaving the line “<span class="placeName-MANNHEIM">Mannheim</span>ʼs towers softened lay—” 
                    to be followed by “But a moment:—darkly down”. It is unclear why <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> omitted the octet, as the lines are found in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>, which he used as copytext

                  <div class="p"><b>“But climbed the cloud yet more and more / . . . / Warned us of the tempest battle” 
                    (<span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>; <i>Poems</i> [<span class="date-1891">1891</span>]; <i>Works</i> [<span class="date-1903">1903</span>])—</b>The 
                    first draft segment of this poem ends with the view of “the lovely [<span class="geogName-NECKAR">Neckar</span>] valley bright” being 
                    threatened by storm—the “Rain and tempest [that] scowling lay” like “a monster oer his prey”. Here, in the second draft segment, which continues the poem, 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> resumed the mode of sublimity in the threatening storm by developing, and then deleting, lines that pursue a martial figure for the advancing storm. 
                    <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> inserted the deleted draft passage into his copytext drawn from the fair copy, because he liked the passage “for the sake of the fine ‘<span class="persName-">Turner</span>’ sky and effect”. 
                    <span class="persName-WGC">He</span> also remarked that the “poem is apparently unfinished” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS4D1891" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>,<span class="title-poem-JRPOEMS4D1891"><i>Poems</i> [4<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>]</span></a>, 1:283; and 
                    <a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS8D1891" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-poem-JRPOEMS8D1891"><i>Poems</i> [8<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>]</span></a>, 1:285).
                    There is no evidence, however, that the poem as found in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy is unfinished, although the prose section is certainly incomplete. In his martial metaphors, 
                    moreover, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was likely thinking, not of <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>, but of the history of multiple and brutal attacks by <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span> against the <span class="placeName-PALATINATE">Palatinate</span> of the <span class="geogName-NECKAR">Neckar</span> valley. 
                    This military history is reflected more explicitly, but still rather distantly and allusively, in the prose section of <span class="title-composite-JRHEIDELBERGCOMP">“Heidelberg”</span> (see the contextual glosses for that section). 
                    The editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> removed the lines from the main copytext and dropped them in a note
