                    identification of this poem, untitled in draft, with <span class="geogName-MAGGIORE">Lago Maggiore</span>, can be supported by some descriptive 
                    details in the poem (albeit tenuous ones) as well as by circumstantial details in <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span>ʼs travel diary. If arguably correct about the poemʼs subject, however, 
                    <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> misplaced it in the sequence of poems in his edition, situating it between <span class="title-poem-JRMILANCATHEDRAL">“Milan Cathedral”</span> 
                    and <span class="title-poem-JRGENOA">“Genoa”</span>. A route from <span class="placeName-MILAN">Milan</span> to <span class="placeName-GENOA">Genoa</span> via <span class="geogName-MAGGIORE">Lago Maggiore</span> was certainly an option, 
                    with <span class="placeName-BELLINZONA">Bellinzona</span> on the north shore of <span class="geogName-MAGGIORE">Lago Maggiore</span> having long served as a juncture between northern <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> and <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span>—“anciently” via the <span class="geogName-GOTHARDPASS">St. Gothard Pass</span>, 
                    and in the post‐Napoleonic era of modern carriage roads via the <span class="geogName-SANBERNARDINOPASS">San Bernardino Pass</span> 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838" target="_self"><span class="title-book-MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITERZLAND1838"><i>Hand‐book for Travellers in Switzerland</i></span></a>, 93;

                    [“The Mont Saint Gothard”, 2; “The Passes of the Bernardin and the Splugen”, 12]). The Ruskins approached <span class="geogName-MAGGIORE">Lago Maggiore</span> 
                    from the south, however, keeping within <span class="placeName-PIEDMONT">Piedmont</span> and arriving at <span class="placeName-ARONA">Arona</span> on the south shore, after visiting <span class="placeName-GENOA">Genoa</span>, <span class="placeName-TURIN">Turin</span>, and <span class="placeName-NOVARA">Novara</span>. 
                    In <span class="placeName-ARONA">Arona</span>, <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span> records, the Ruskins lodged in a hotel “close to the water”, spending their first afternoon “out on the balcony . . . enjoying the beautiful view up and down the lake”—perhaps 
                    the origin of the peacefulness conveyed in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem. According to <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>, the Ruskins considered this view “far superior” to the more dramatic 
                    mountain scenery surrounding <span class="geogName-LAKECOMO">Lago di Como</span>, the gentle hills around <span class="geogName-MAGGIORE">Lago Maggiore</span> and more distant snowy <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> suggesting to them the homely

                    Like many visitors to <span class="placeName-ARONA">Arona</span>, where the Ruskins stayed while touring the lake, they visited the bronze <span class="title-artwork-CERANOSANCARLONE">“colossal statue of S. Carlo Borromeo”</span>,

                    “On the summit of a hill, about half an hourʼs walk from the town, stands the <i><span class="title-artwork-CERANOSANCARLONE">Colossal Statue of St. Charles Borromeo</span></i>, 
                    66 ft. high, and placed on a pedestal 40 ft. high. The head, hands, and feet, alone, are cast in bronze, the rest of the figure is formed of sheets of beaten copper, 
                    arranged round a pillar of rough masonry which forms the support of it. The saint is represented extending his hand towards the lake, 
                    and over his birth‐place, <span class="placeName-ARONA">Arona</span>, bestowing on them his benediction. There is grace in the attitude, in spite of the gigantic proportions of the figure, 
                    and benevolence beams from the countenance;—altogether the effect of it is good and very impressive. It was erected, <span class="date-1697">1697</span>, by subscriptions, 
                    principally contributed by the Borromean family. It is possible to enter the statue and to mount up into the head, but the ascent is difficult and fatiguing, 
                    and not to be attempted by the nervous. It is effected by means of two ladders, tied together (provided by a man who lives hard by), resting on the pedestal, 
                    and reaching up to the skirt of the saintʼs robe. Between the folds of the upper and lower drapery the adventurous climber squeezes himself through—a task 
                    of some difficulty, if he be of corpulent dimensions; and he then clambers up the stone pillar which supports the head, by placing his feet upon the iron bars 
                    or cramps by which the copper drapery is attached to it. To effect this, he must assume a straddling attitude, and proceed in the dark till he reaches the head, 
                    which he will find capable of holding 3 persons at once. Here he may rest himself by sitting down in the recess of the nose, which forms no bad substitute 
                    for an arm‐chair. In the neighbouring church several relics of <span class="persName-CBORROMEO">St. Carlo</span> are preserved”

               <div class="p"><span class="persName-CBORROMEO">Carlo Borromeo</span> (<span class="date-1538-1584">1538–84</span>) was archbishop of <span class="placeName-MILAN">Milan</span> and a leader of the Counter‐Reformation. His statue, known as the <span class="title-artwork-CERANOSANCARLONE">San Carlone</span>, 
                        was commissioned by his cousin, <span class="persName-FBORROMEO">Federico Borromeo</span> (<span class="date-1564-1631">1564–1631</span>), 
                        as part of a <i>sacromonte</i>, which, according to <span class="persName-LWOLKSIMON">Linda Wolk‐Simon</span>, was to be 
                        “comprised of some thirty chapels on a mountainside commemorating events from <span class="persName-CBORROMEO">Carlo</span>ʼs exemplary life 
                        of pastoral care and spiritual devotion”, culminating “in a colossal bronze statue of the saint looking out at <span class="geogName-MAGGIORE">Lago Maggiore</span>”. 
                        The scheme was planned by <span class="date-1598">1598</span>, but not begun until <span class="date-1614">1614</span>, well after <span class="persName-CBORROMEO">Carlo</span>ʼs canonization, and never completed. 
                        The <span class="title-artwork-CERANOSANCARLONE">colossus</span> was finally cast and erected in <span class="date-1698">1698</span> by the sculptors <span class="persName-BFALCONE">Bernardo Falcone</span> (active <span class="date-1659-1694">1659–94</span>) and <span class="persName-SZANELLI">Siro Zanelli</span> (d. <span class="date-1724">1724</span>), based on a design by <span class="persName-GBCRESPT">Giovanni Battista Crespi</span>, known as <span class="persName-CERANO">Cerano</span> (ca. <span class="date-1575-1632">1575–1632</span>), 
                        a multi‐talented artist who was appointed by <span class="persName-FBORROMEO">Federico</span> as professor of painting for his Accademia del Disegno, attached to his library, the <span class="placeName-building-AMBROSIANA">Ambrosiana</span>, at <span class="placeName-MILAN">Milan</span>. 
                        <span class="persName-LWOLKSIMON">Wolk‐Simon</span> says of the drawing on which <span class="title-artwork-CERANOSANCARLONE">the colossus</span> was based: 
                        “Most striking in the drawing is the realism of the figure, whose individualized, distinctive features are at once recognizable. 
                        This work (and the sculpture for which it served as a model) was . . . intended to be an authentic image, one that by virtue of its very authenticity, 
                        or <i>verismo</i>, acquired a moral and spiritual authority imparted by its subject”
