                    guidebooks, which began appearing in <span class="date-1836">1836</span>, were not free from apodictic judgments about the superior good sense of the British, this sentiment about the wide differences 
                    between the &#x201C;races&#x201D; of the British and the French seems more typical of English observers arriving shortly after the victory at <span class="placeName-WATERLOO">Waterloo</span> 
                    than of English tourists arriving almost two decades after the reopening of the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span> 
                    (see &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#PARSONSWORTHTHEDETOUR" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-NTP">Parsons</span>, <span class="title-book-PARSONSWORTHTHEDETOUR"><i>Worth the Detour</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 184&#x2013;88). 
                    For example, writing about his Continental tour of <span class="date-1817">1817</span>, the <span class="placeName-LIVERPOOL">Liverpool</span> Congregational minister, 
                    <span class="persName-TRAFFLES">Thomas Raffles</span> (<span class="date-1788-1863">1788&#x2013;1863</span>), described his culture shock when coming in view of the port at <span class="placeName-DIEPPE">Dieppe</span>: 
                    &#x201C;the land I had so ardently desired to see&#x2014;the people with whom I had longed to mingle&#x2014;the habits and the manners I had often contemplated at a distance, were now before me&#x201D;. 
                    The first encounter shook him, as &#x201C;multitudes&#x201D; of women efficiently lent their arms to pull the English vessel into harbor: 
                    &#x201C;Their dress&#x2014;their language&#x2014;their manners&#x2014;their whole appearance, was quite new, and we felt in a moment that we were in a foreign land. It is scarcely 
                    conceivable that so few miles and hours should make so vast a difference in one&#x02BC;s feelings, and completely excite all that can be conveyed by the word <i>foreigner</i> 
                    in the bosom. It was not a little strange to hear a language which we had been accustomed to associate with every idea of polish and of elegance, 
                    chattered with amazing volubility by the motley group collected on the quay to witness our arrival&#x201D;.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">If the French women disconcerted <span class="persName-TRAFFLES">Raffles</span>, the &#x201C;military men&#x201D; idly &#x201C;sauntering&#x201D; on the quay failed to &#x201C;excite a very favourable impression in my mind 
                        of the French military character or costume. Their dress was extremely mean and slovenly&#x201D;, and one &#x201C;looked in vain for that bold and manly air&#x2014;that dignified and 
                        noble independence, which are the usual indications of bravery, and generally associated with the profession of a soldier. . . . Are these, thought I, 
                        the men that have made monarchs tremble on their thrones, and kept the world in awe&#x2014;were they such men as these that bore the eagles of <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span> 
                        to the gates of <span class="placeName-VIENNA">Vienna</span>, and reaped the laurels of <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span> on the fields of <span class="placeName-AUSTERLITZ">Austerlitz</span> and <span class="placeName-MARENGO">Marengo</span>&#x201D;?</div>

                    <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span> was sized up in terms of British travelers&#x02BC; complaints about difficulties in negotiating customs and finding lodging; see, for example,

                    chose to depict in his vignette heading this introductory poem. Typically what is lacking from <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s influence on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, 
                    however, is the older poet&#x02BC;s crowded historical references. <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> uses the trope of the city gate to allude to the story in the

                    This was the time required for the Ruskins&#x02BC; crossing, <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span> commenting: &#x201C;two hours and a half exactly in crossing and just saved the tide 
                    so that we all landed at the pier, without having recourse to small boats&#x201D; 
                    (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#RFT48" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-manuscript-RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 1). 
                    Unless a return crossing (which is what <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;four hours&#x201D; estimates) did require a longer time, 
                    his narrator is mistaken; and in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> version <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                    substituted &#x201C;half an hours&#x02BC;&#x201D; crossing&#x2014;a change that did not improve on the accuracy of &#x201C;four hours&#x201D;, 
                    but that captured the tone he desired for his narrator.</div>
