                    division of his poem into “books”, along with his imitation of running heads that change from one book to the next (at least until he abandons running heads altogether), 
                    does not correspond to the edition of <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs novel that was in the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin library</span>—the 
                    <span class="date-1820">1820</span> first edition in three volumes, with the <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> firm of Longman allotted the lead position on the title page as managing publisher, 
                    and the <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span> firm of Constable demoted to second place (see

                    The Longman first edition divided the text into three volumes, each divided by chapters, with the chapter numbering starting anew with each volume. 
                    The running heads—though set in small capitals, similarly to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs imitation in <a href="/apparatuses/msiii_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a>—are formed solely from the title of the novel 
                    and do not change with volumes and chapters. Finally, the page number is set on the same baseline as the running head, alternating right to left 
                    with recto and verso, and not centered beneath the running head as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> devises.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">If <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> imitated any publication in particular, he apparently modeled his layout on a poem divided into books, 
                        and formatted with marginal line numbering. If so, the model was not from <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs poems, which are divided into cantos, not books; 
                        and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs layout does not resemble that used by the Constable firm and the printer, <span class="persName-JAMESBALLANTYNE">James Ballantyne</span>, 
                        which produced the editions of <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs poems owned by the Ruskins prior to 1830 (see

                    The line group is placed at the beginning of the <i>ERM</i> transcription because it was evidently composed prior to the lines on the recto, and because these lines 
                    precede and flow into the lines on the recto, without any intervening text, according to the corresponding fair copy of this passage in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>.

                    apart from three lines positioned at the top of the page (lines 60–62 as fair‐copied), which were evidently composed at the end of the process, 
                    the line group on this side of the manuscript consists, in order of appearance, of lines 20–21, 14–19, and 22–25 
                    as numbered in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> fair copy.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">The displacement of lines 21–22 from the order in which they are found in fair copy cannot be adequately explained 
                        owing to damage to the edges of this draft manuscript, which caused gaps in the text. In the manuscriptʼs original state, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have indicated that lines 20–21 were to be inserted 
                        in the place that they occupy in fair copy, or he may have decided on this change during the process of fair copying. 
                        The former hypothesis might explain the presence of the horizontal rule, which divides these two lines from the remainder of the text. 
                        On the recto, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> used such a rule along with a metamark to indicate that a verse line adjacent to the rule 
                        was to be inserted in another place in the text. Metamarks may have been lost with the damage to the verso text, 
                        which would have confirmed that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> likewise intended a transposition here, as well.</div></span><br><br>

                    passage underwent considerable revision in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> draft, <span class="title-manuscript-">“come on good horse and let us see”</span>. 
                    In <i>ERM</i>, the passage is interpreted in documentary XML markup as two substitutions, one simple and a second complex—the latter subdivided into three actions. 
                    This note comments on possible interpretations of the sequence of those actions.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">In the first substitution, contained in the line “but it was great avenels fate”, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        replaced a deleted word with “great”, which he wrote in the right margin. The deleted word is nearly illegible but appears to be “gay”.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">The second, more complex substitution involves several rejected and substituted lines. The sequence of this process of revision 
                        is open to at least three variable interpretations, though the documentary evidence of the component deletions and additions is clear, and 
                        can be subdivided into distinct actions, which lead clearly to the outcome in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> fair‐copy passage of the <span class="title-poem-JRMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span>.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Following “but it was great avenels fate”, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composed two lines, 
                        “to see things that nobody saw / except themselves, and would say pshaw”. To obtain this account of the haunting of the House of Avenel, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> temporarily departed from the Halloween episode in <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs chapter 3 that he was mainly summarizing, in order to draw from a gossipy exchange 
                        between <span class="persName-fictional-ELSPETGLENDINNING">Elspet Glendinning</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-TTACKET">Tibb Tacket</span> in chapter 4, in which <span class="persName-fictional-TTACKET">Tibb</span> boasts about spirits like the <span class="persName-fictional-WHITELADY">White Maiden of Avenel</span> that are peculiarly attached 
                        to “‘great ancient families’” like the Avenels. From this exchange, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> borrowed dialogue that can be recognized, somewhat altered, 
                        in the couplet about “avenels fate”: for example, <span class="persName-fictional-TTACKET">Tibb</span> observes that <span class="persName-fictional-MARYAVENEL">Mary Avenel</span>, having been born on Halloween, 
                        is able to “‘see mair than ither folk’”; and the gruff “pshaw” is characteristic of <span class="persName-fictional-ELSPETGLENDINNING">Elspet</span>, 
                        although in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs couplet the expression is suspended without a clear agent—ambiguously applicable either to the Avenel family or to outsiders 
                        (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#SCOTTMONASTERYFIELDING" target="_self"><span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>, <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY"><i>The Monastery</i></span>, ed. <span class="persName-PFIELDING">Fielding</span></a>, 
                        55–56 [vol. 1, chap. 4]; and see also 40 [vol. 1, chap. 2]).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">The documentary evidence for next step in the process is open to multiple interpretations of the sequence of composition. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have composed the next couplet, 
                        “so it was in this odd time / for a spirit haunted avenels line”, with or without having made the deletion shown by strikethrough of the preceding couplet, 
                        “to see things that nobody saw / except themselves, and would say pshaw”. The two couplets read coherently in sequence if no lines are deleted—“but 
                        it was great avenels fate / to see things that nobody saw / except themselves, and would say pshaw / 
                        so it was in this odd time / for a spirit haunted avenels line”. In fact, the flow is improved by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs insertion of “and” above the beginning of the line, 
                        “so it was in this odd time” (the conjunction appears also in the fair copy). But the second couplet also flows coherently, if awkwardly, 
                        from “but it was great avenels fate” with the intervening couplet omitted. Finally, a third possibility 
                        can be drawn from the deletion of the line, “for a spirit haunted avenels line”, in the manuscript: it is possible that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> never intended that line 
                        to form a couplet with the preceding line “and so it was in this odd time”; rather, the latter can be interpreted as a subtitution above the line, 
                        replacing “for a spirit haunted avenels line”. (While the interlinear spacing in the manuscript does not appear crowded, 
                        the line “so it was in this odd time” does appear compacted relative to the cursive hand in the other lines.)</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">In the simplest reconstruction of the process, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> can be imagined as composing the two couplets following “but it was great avenels fate” 
                        without making any deletions. Then he deleted the first, second, and fourth lines of the two couplets, leaving just “and so it was this odd time”. 
                        As part of this change, he inserted an asterisk to serve as a metamark following “but it was great avenels fate”. 
                        The metamark directs the reader to a line near the bottom of the page, “to have a spirit in their line”, which is marked by corresponding asterisk, 
                        and set off by a horizontal rule. The metamark signals that this line is to be inserted following “but it was great avenels fate”, 
                        thus substituting for the three deleted lines, and forming a completed couplet with the remaining line, “to have a spirit in their line”. 
                        The resulting revised passage reads, as in the fair copy, “but it was great avenels fate / 
                        to have a spirit in their line / and so it was this odd time”. This outcome involving the insertion of the substitute line, as directed by the metamark, 
                        unquestionably formed the final action of the change, regardless of the process of deletion and substitution that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> followed with respect to the preceding pair of couplets.</div></span><br><br>
