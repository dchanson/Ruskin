                    declared the village of <span class="placeName-SPLUGENVILLAGE">Splügen</span> “a poor place”

                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> represents the village as a pastoral respite from the sublime experience of the <span class="geogName-VIAMALA">Via Mala</span>. 
                    In his guidebook to <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span>, <span class="persName-JM">John Murray III</span> treats <span class="placeName-SPLUGENVILLAGE">Splügen</span> 
                    in a businesslike manner as “the chief place in the desolate pastoral vale of the <span class="geogName-RHEINWALD">Rheinwald</span>. . . . 
                    The atmosphere is very chilly here, and barley barely ripens”. The villageʼs economy, <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> explains, 
                    depended on serving as a transport hub, “prosper[ing] by the constant passage of goods and travellers to and from <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>. 
                    In autumn it is thronged with drovers; large herds of cattle and many horses then cross the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> for the <span class="placeName-MILAN">Milan</span> market”

                    According to <span class="persName-WBI">William Brockedon</span>, the villageʼs “importance” as a “depôt” did not decline owing to the <span class="placeName-AUSTRIA">Austrian</span> governmentʼs recent engineering 
                    improvements to carriage roads through the <span class="geogName-SPLUGEN">Splügen Pass</span>, although prior to the increased flow of self‐sufficient conveyances, 
                    the village maintained “some hundreds of horses and mules . . . for the transport of goods”

                    None of these conditions is evident in <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs poem, in which the only sign of droversʼ herds is a bucolic “few cattle straying”.</div></span><br><br>

                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs early acquaintance with this word likely came through <span class="persName-ME">Maria Edgeworth</span>ʼs
