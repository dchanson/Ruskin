                decision to isolate the word <i>so</i> on its own line here does not appear in keeping with
                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs lineation of the original witness of the poem
                fair‐copied in <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self">MS I</a>, in which <i>so</i> appears to have been indented as runover 
                belonging to the line “was better than our mouses so” (“his sight” in the line “of her
                good wall for then his sight” and “dog just then” in the line “when frightened was the dog
                just then” are similarly indented in the <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self">MS I</a> witness and, interestingly, <i>were</i> apparently
                interpreted by <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> as runover in this printed edition of the poem). Further
                evidence that the <span class="persName-JR">author</span> intended <i>so</i> to belong to the line
                “was better than our mouses so” may be found in the fact that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs
                    decision to isolate the word disrupts the original aabbccddeeffgg coupleted rhyme scheme of the <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self">MS I</a> witness—imposing
                a less elegant aabbccdd<i>e</i>ffgg<i>hh</i> rhyme scheme instead.</div></span><br><br>
