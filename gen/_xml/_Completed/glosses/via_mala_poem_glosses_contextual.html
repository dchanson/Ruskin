                    to cross the <span class="geogName-SPLUGEN">Splügen</span>, “one of the wildest and most beautiful passes of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>”,

               <div class="p"><span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>ʼs account of the dayʼs journey is condensed, starting with where “the lower and higher Rhine unite” 
                        (i.e., the confluence of the <span class="geogName-VORDERRHEIN">Vorderrhein</span> and <span class="geogName-HINTERRHEIN">Hinterrhein</span> at <span class="placeName-REICHENAU">Reichenau</span>), 
                        “a little below <span class="placeName-THUSIS">Thusis</span>”. From here, she continues, the “road goes along the side of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>” 
                        (i.e, the <span class="geogName-HINTERRHEIN">Hinterrhein</span>); and entering the gorge of the <span class="geogName-VIAMALA">Via Mala</span>, the passage leads between 
                        “immense high rocks [that] rise almost perpendicularly on each side of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> (which is here a narrow stream) . . . covered 
                        in many parts to the very top with majestic pines”. Her next sentence remarks “houses surrounded by richly cultivated land”, and then she briefly describes 
                        <span class="geogName-SPLUGEN">Splügen Pass</span> and the <span class="placeName-SPLUGENVILLAGE">village of Splügen</span>. 
                        The cultivated region beyond the <span class="geogName-VIAMALA">Via Mala</span> probably refers to the village of <span class="placeName-ANDEER">Andeer</span> 
                        in the <span class="geogName-SCHAMS">Schams Valley</span>. Beyond its “beautiful rich vineyards”, <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> fails to mention the 
                        cataract in the <span class="geogName-ROFLARAVINE">Gorge of Rofla</span>, where the river is confined into a torrent, but she does comment approvingly on the new <span class="placeName-AUSTRIA">Austrian</span> road, 
                        “good as any road in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Great Britain</span>”, which led the family over the <span class="geogName-SPLUGEN">Splügen</span>. 
                        Had they continued traveling along the <span class="geogName-HINTERRHEIN">Hinterrhein</span>, they would have entered the <span class="geogName-RHEINWALD">Rheinwald Valley</span> 
                        and crossed instead at the <span class="geogName-SANBERNARDINOPASS">San Bernardino Pass</span>, which descends to <span class="geogName-LAKEMAGGIORE">Lago Maggiore</span> 
                        rather than to <span class="geogName-">Lago di Como</span> below the <span class="geogName-SPLUGEN">Splügen</span> 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFT48" target="_self">Diary of <span class="persName-">Mary Richardson</span>, 1833</a>, 40–41).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Preferring the sublime over the beautiful cultivated places that catch his cousinʼs eye, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> focuses his poem on the foaming 
                        of the swollen yet narrowly confined <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>, “like an avalanche below”, which, as the traveler climbs the precipitous steep above the river, 
                        is gradually “softened” in its roar to “Murmuring up from the profound / Of distance dark where light of day / Pierced not” but 
                        “Whence the white foam looked up so clear”. Some of these details may have been prompted by <span class="persName-WBI">William Brockedon</span>ʼs 
                        description in <a href="/notes/bibliography#BROCKEDONILLUSTRATIONS" target="_self"><span class="title-book-BROCKEDONILLUSTRATIONS"><i>Illustrations of the Passes of the Alps</i></span></a>, 
                        which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> received for his <span class="date-1834-02">February 1834 birthday</span>. For a span of four miles, <span class="persName-WBI">Brockedon</span> writes, 
                        “a deep ravine is formed by the bases of mountains, rising 6000 and even 8000 feet above the torrent of the <span class="geogName-HINTERRHEIN">Hinter-Rhin</span>, 
                        which separates them”. He adds in a note: “In many places, where the road is carried 300 or 400 feet above the river, the sides of the ravine are not 50 feet apart. 
                        Such spots have been chosen for the construction of bridges, which it requires a firm head to look over steadily. The struggles of the torrent from that depth reach the ear 
                        only in murmurs; and when seen amidst the deep and dark abyss, its white foam appears to go up the ravine, from the eddy which its violence produces“ 
                        (vol. 2, “The Pass of the Bernardin”, p. 7). In his poem, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> does not recoil from “looking oer the barrier”, 
                        and he reports what may be more unique to his memory of the vista, “A strange cold light through the yawning dread / Of the Abyssy gulph below”.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">By <span class="date-1838">1838</span>, <span class="persName-JM">John Murray III</span> was moved to give the traveler a more expansive and dramatic description of the <span class="geogName-VIAMALA">Via Mala</span> than 
                        <span class="persName-WBI">Brockedon</span>ʼs: “It is difficult to give, with any precision, the dimensions of this gorge, which has cleft the mountains through the chine. 
                        The precipices, which often rise perpendicularly on both sides of it, are certainly in some places 1600 ft. high, and, in many places, not more than 10 yards apart. 
                        The <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>, compressed within this narrow, stony bed to the width of a pigmy rivulet, is barely audible as it rushes 
                        through the depths below the road. The rocks of slate and limestone, composing the walls of the ravine, are so hard that they appear to have suffered no disintegration 
                        from the weather; the fracture is so fresh and sharp that, were the convulsive force from below, which divided them, again called forth to unite them, 
                        it seems as though the gulf would close and leave no aperture behind. When the traveller enters the mouth of the defile”—“the peasants give it the name of the 
                        <span class="geogName-VERLORENLOCH">Lost Gulf (Trou perdu, Verlohrne Loch)</span>”—“the sudden transition from the glare 
                        of sunshine, to the gloom of a chasm so narrow that it leaves but a strip of sky visible overhead, is exceedingly striking”. <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> 
                        urges the traveler to dismount from the carriage and make the journey on foot, as he describes the scenery from the three bridges that cross from side to side above the river
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838" target="_self">Murray, <i>Hand‐book for Travellers in <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span></i></a>, 206).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-WBI">Brockedon</span>, who was an inventor as well as an artist and writer, weights his description more on the side of engineering than of poetry, 
                        impressed by the feat of <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span>ʼs engineers in laying roads across the <span class="geogName-SIMPLON">Simplon</span> 
                        and <span class="geogName-CENIS">Cenis</span> passes, which he perceives as overcoming not only natural barriers but also the “prejudices of those nations 
                        who had opposed the making of such roads as would facilitate future communication”. Now that “national jealousies have been removed, and a more enlightened policy 
                        has extended commercial intercourse”, he believes, other “mule paths” across the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> “have been superseded 
                        by carriage roads; and not only have the governments of <span class="placeName-AUSTRIA">Austria</span>, <span class="placeName-SARDINIAKINGDOM">Sardinia</span>, 
                        and <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span>, carefully preserved the routes in the great lines of communication which were made by <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span>, 
                        for military or commerical purposes, but they have made other roads on their frontiers acros the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#BROCKEDONILLUSTRATIONS" target="_self"><span class="title-book-BROCKEDONILLUSTRATIONS"><i>Illustrations of the Passes of the Alps</i></span></a>, vol. 2, “The Pass of the Bernardin”, pp. 1–2). 
                        Because of these efforts, the sublime experience of <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alpine</span> crossing had been rendered safe for travelers in the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span> 
                        (albeit set back by disastrous floods of <span class="date-1834">1834</span>)—a “surface . . . as good as any road in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Great Britain</span>”, 
                        <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> opined—and the guidebooks of the period celebrate the craft of the Italian engineer, <span class="persName-GLP">Giulio Pocobelli</span> (<span class="date-1766-1843">1766–1843</span>) 
                        almost as much as they mythologize the ambition of <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span>. (Credit properly belonged also to <span class="persName-GLP">Pocobelli</span>ʼs assistant, 
                        <span class="persName-RLN">Richard La Nicca</span> [<span class="date-1794-1883">1794–1883</span>].) For <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span>, 
                        marveling about engineering could combine easily with admiration of the picturesque: <span class="persName-GLP">Pocobelli</span> having blasted a tunnel through the 
                        <span class="geogName-VERLORENLOCH">Verlohrne Loch</span>, piercing a “projecting buttress of rock which had previously denied all access”, the resulting 
                        view “is very pleasing”, “looking back from this [tunnel passage], through the dark vista of black rock and the fringe of firs upon the ruined 
                        <span class="placeName-building-HOHENRATIENCASTLE">tower of Realt [Castle Hohen Rätien]</span> and the sun‐lit
