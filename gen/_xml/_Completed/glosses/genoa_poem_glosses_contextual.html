                        The canal was the <span class="geogName-NAVIGLIOPAVESE">Naviglio di Pavia</span> (or <span class="geogName-NAVIGLIOPAVESE">Naviglio Pavese</span>), which connected

                        In either case, the topography of the poem is somewhat confused, since this vista, which is described starting with the lines, <span class="title-poem-JROFVARIOUSTREES">“Of various trees a vista green”</span>,
