                    The first word in this line (“Peak”) is supplied from the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy. It is likely also that, 
                    in the undamaged original, this line was followed by a version of the line that completes the couplet in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>: 
                    “The lofty crags deep chasms sever”.</div></span><br><br>
