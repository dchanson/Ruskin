                        His failure leads the adults to confer among themselves, as do the parents in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs version, 
                        but the discussion between <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>ʼs adults is solemn, reflecting the bookʼs thesis, which is set forth in the authorʼs preface: 
                        parents should instill habits of self‐control in their sons before sending them to public school. 
                        If parents neglect to train their sons in self‐command, the boys will succumb to their schoolfellowsʼ reckless challenges to prove their “manliness” 
                        in foolish and damaging ways. The argument is not that proper manliness is to be instilled by corporal punishment: 
                        <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span>ʼs response to his disgrace ultimately disproves <span class="persName-fictional-COLONELBIRCHME">Colonel Birch</span>ʼs contention that a boy will learn his Latin 
                        only if its rules are “flogged” into him by schoolmasters. Rather, as <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> demonstrates, self‐control must be mastered by the boy himself. 
                        Recovering from his sobs, <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> retires to gain control over himself and his get his lesson by heart. Then, in the scene that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> adapts to his own purposes, 
                        <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> “march[es] up” to <span class="persName-fictional-COLONELBIRCHME">Colonel Birch</span> to say his lesson perfectly (just as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> “marched up” to her <span class="persName-fictional-PAPA">father</span>

                        (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL" target="_self"><span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>, <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><i>Frank: A Sequel</i></span></a>, 1:86–96).</div>

                        but a parentsʼ preoccupation with and excessive intervention in learning. The “fault of the present day”, according to the authorʼs preface, 
                        is the phenomenon of “anxious private education”. While the danger to a home‐schooled boy is effeminacy, the undermining of manliness 
                        is caused only in part by living too much at home “‘with gentle girls and women’”. In contemporary home education, both fathers and mothers 
                        can be at fault for “too much anxiety concerning details. Parents and private tutors are not only too eager to adopt every new receipt 
                        for teaching much in a short time, but are also too easily alarmed by every deficiency which they perceive in their pupils, 
                        and draw too readily evil auguries from every trifle. They are so anxious to make their pupils go on, and go right, 
                        and go straight, every instant, that they deprive them of the power of acting, thinking, feeling for themselves. 
                        Thus they turn them either into helpless puppets, who must cease to move, or fall when the guiding strings are no longer pulled; 
                        or, if they be not reduced to this automaton state, they become restive, wilful creatures, who, the instant they are at liberty, 
                        set off in a contrary direction to that in which they have been forced” (1:54, xvi–xvii).</div>

                    from an exchange between brother and sister in <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span>. 
                    His summary of the procedure for lifting and supporting a shipʼs keel, besides being slightly inaccurate, 
                    is difficult to follow, because <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> omits <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span>ʼs contextualizing.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span> begins with more obvious and traditional means of raising a ship in dry dock: 
                    “‘Some time ago, the day my <span class="persName-fictional-PAPAME">father</span> took me into the dock‐yard, he showed me a ship lying in what is called a dock. 
                    The keel was to be repaired, and for this purpose it was necessary to raise up the ship, so that the workmen might get underneath. 
                    The question my <span class="persName-fictional-PAPAME">father</span> asked me was, ‘how the vessel could be raised?’ I was an hour puzzling about it, . . . 
                    but never [thought] of the easy way that was before my eyes—to let in the water from outside of the dock. The water,
                    you know, would gradually float the vessel, and raise it up to the proper height, where it could be propped up, and the water let out again next tide.’”</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-fictional-LUCYME">Lucy</span> inquires about a “different way of raising a ship” that she knows their <span class="persName-fictional-PAPAME">father</span> had described to <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span>. 
                        <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span> goes on: “‘You must first of all know, that when a vessel is floated into a dock to be repaired, 
                        <i>she</i> is allowed to settle down with her keel upon thick wooden blocks, along the middle of the dock: 
                        . . . formerly when she was to be raised up, for the people to get under the keel, two or three hundred <i>shores</i>, 
                        or props of timber, were placed all under her bottom, nearly upright; wedges were then just pointed under the lower end of each of these shores, 
                        and all the workmen from every part of the dock‐yard being summoned with their <i>mauls</i>, or huge hammers, 
                        and stationed one or two to each shore, the wedges were all struck at the same instant by word of command. 
                        A few blows from all the mauls was sufficient just to raise the ship from off the blocks, which were then taken away, 
                        and the ship was left hanging in the air, supported by the shores’”.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">The new way, which has replaced this time‐ and labor‐intensive method, is what <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> summarizes: 
                        “‘The blocks on which the keel is to lie are not solid lumps of wood; they are composed of three pieces, two of which are <i>wedges</i>, 
                        and when these are knocked out, the centre piece of the block falls. The ship is floated into the dock as usual, 
                        and when the water subsides, the keel rests on the new‐fashioned blocks: the forest of shores are then firmly placed 
                        under all parts of the shipʼs bottom, in the same way as I described to you before, but without any wedges [pointed beneath the shores]. 
                        Now, <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span>, comes the beautiful contrivance—two or three men only are sufficient to do the rest: 
                        they give a few knocks on the sides of the wedges, of which the blocks are composed—out they fly—the blocks sink, 
                        and the ship hangs on the shores’”.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-fictional-LUCYME">Lucy</span> agrees that “‘it is such a pretty contrivance, that 1 should like very much to see it done.

                    though disturbed, not being drawn out of each otherʼs attraction; therefore, as soon as the force upon them ceases to act, 
                    they restore themselves to their former position”. However, “the reverse of the attraction of cohesion” or “repulsion” 
                    prevails “if a glass or any hard substance be broken”, and “the parts cannot be made to cohere without first being moistened, 
                    because the repulsion is too great to admit of a reunion” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES" target="_self"><span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>, <span class="title-book-JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><i>Scientific Dialogues</i></span></a>, 1:37, 36).</div></span><br><br>

                    This desire arises near the beginning of the book, when <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span> proposes to measure the height of a mountain by comparing the difference between barometric pressures at sea level and at the top the mountain, 
                    and converting the difference in degrees to a scale in feet. Prior to their journey, <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span> and his <span class="persName-fictional-PAPAME">father</span> carry out the experiment on a more limited scale by scaling 
                    a church tower with the portable barometer in hand, thereby working out the towerʼs height. <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span> uses this episode to prompt learning through several comparisons of a thematic kind, 
                    including tensions between <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span>ʼs bent for theorizing and <span class="persName-fictional-LUCYME">Lucy</span>ʼs pragmatism, between <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span>ʼs solemn methodicalness and <span class="persName-fictional-LUCYME">Lucy</span>ʼs mercurial imaginativeness, 
                    and between <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span>ʼs braving adventures to the point of imprudence and <span class="persName-fictional-LUCYME">Lucy</span>ʼs voicing anxieties to the point of endangering others (see 1:19–38).</div>

                    This portion of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs narrative was taken by <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> to be “probably a bit of history” 
                    solely on the grounds, it seeems, that the adventures are “told with lively artlessness”

                     But while <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> folds in at least one episode directly from <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span> (the exploding wagon), 
                    it does seem unlikely that he would wholly invent a journey taken in the opposite direction from <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>ʼs characters, 
                    unless his parents had actually taken him to <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span>—a place that, compared to <span class="placeName-BRISTOL">Bristol</span> and environs, 
                    had only recently begun promoting itself as a tourist destination. Tending to the confirm the basis in reality, 
                    the Ruskins are known to have visited <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> on at least one other occasion, and probably more (see

                        and one strains to match his details with a reality that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have half‐remembered and half‐created. There are no mountains in <span class="placeName-KENT">Kent</span>,

                        such as the resort, <span class="placeName-TUNBRIDGEWELLS">Tunbridge Wells</span>. As an <span class="date-1810">1810</span> topograhical account describes the settlement, <span class="placeName-TUNBRIDGEWELLS">Tunbridge Wells</span> 
                        lay in a valley and spread over “adjacent hills of a wild forest aspect, with rocks of considerable magnitude”. 
                        The villageʼs three hills—named <span class="geogName-MOUNTSION">Mount Sion</span>, <span class="geogName-MOUNTPLEASANT">Mount Pleasant</span>, and <span class="geogName-MOUNTEPHRAIM">Mount Ephraim</span>—might have been described as “made by mens hands” 
                        owing not only to their picturesque beauty but also to their settlement with villas. On the London Road beyond the spa, 
                        “the characteristic feature of the country” is hard sandstone, which forms “various considerable prominences” that can “assume the majestic character of rocks”

                    had blown up the whole”. The wagoner is a “sulky fellow” and disbelieves the story until hearing the name of the hill where the accident occurred.

                                    at three oʼclock in the afternoon, he observed a great quantity of dust rising from the ground, and covering a field,

                        he cribbed nearly verbatim from a section entitled “The Attempts that have been made to explain some of the more unusual appearances in the earth and heaven by electricity”

                        In that section, <span class="persName-JP">Priestley</span> collects hypotheses about electrical causes of natural phenomena, especially observations by the Italian physicist <span class="persName-GBECCARIA">Giambattista Beccaria</span> (<span class="date-1716-1781">1716–81</span>). 
                        <span class="persName-GBECCARIA">Beccaria</span> made his reputation as one of <span class="geogName-EUROPE">Europe</span>ʼs most fervent champions of <span class="persName-BF">Franklin</span>ʼs theories, positioning himself in opposition to the rival French school of electricians 
                        headed by <span class="persName-ANOLLET">Abbé Nollet</span> (<span class="date-1700-1770">1700–1770</span>). As one core difference, the French school had come to account for the phenomenon of electrical attraction and repulsion by theorizing two differing kinds 
                        of electrical “fluid”, whereas <span class="persName-BF">Franklin</span> proposed a single fluid capable of two differing states—positive and negative, or plus and minus, 
                        which <span class="persName-BF">Franklin</span> conceived as an excess or a deficiency of charge associated with a body, as compared with its neutral state. In this mathematical approach to theorizing the phenomenon, 
                        as opposed to <span class="persName-ANOLLET">Nollet</span>ʼs fixation on kind, <span class="persName-BF">Franklin</span> understood a bodyʼs fluctuating states of charge in terms of influences acting on it, affecting what he called the bodyʼs surrounding “atmosphere” of charge

                        <span class="persName-JP">Priestley</span> wrote his account of the “present state” of electrical theory, already committed to support of <span class="persName-BF">Franklin</span> (<a href="/notes/bibliography#SCHIFFERDRAWTHELIGHTNINGDOWN" target="_self"><span class="persName-MBS">Schiffer</span>, <span class="title-book-SCHIFFERDRAWTHELIGHTNINGDOWN"><i>Draw the Lightning Down</i></span></a>, 72–73). 
                        Thus, in the section on electricity as an underlying cause of dramatic natural phenomena on earth and in the heavens, 
                        a commonality linking the observations that <span class="persName-JP">Priestley</span> draws from <span class="persName-GBECCARIA">Beccaria</span> and others lies in the support their observations lend to <span class="persName-BF">Franklin</span>ʼs theories.</div>
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-JP">Priestley</span>ʼs chapter is not merely partisan, however. As <span class="persName-MBS">Michael Brian Schiffer</span> remarks, 
                        although <span class="date-1701-1800">eighteenth‐century</span> electricians exaggerated the role that electricity plays in causation of a multitude of natural phenomena, 
                        the ability to model massive natural forces in laboratory experiments and pose theoretical explanations confirmed the power and prestige of <span class="date-1637-1815">Enlightenment</span> ideology

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> seems to have been drawn to <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>ʼs conversation summarizing these atmospheric and terrestrial effects—the only chapter 
                        he extracts from the volume on electricity and magnetism in <span class="title-book-JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><i>Scientific Dialogues</i></span>—not only because it relates electricity to landscape, 
                        but also because he can join the explanatory power of science to the image‐making power of poetry, finding “something like” the experimentally observed interaction of positively and negatively charged rainclouds in <span class="persName-GCB">Byron</span>ʼs <span class="title-poem-BYRONMANFRED"><i>Manfred</i></span>. 
                        It is a theme in <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span>

                  <div class="p">One can probably claim too much for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs understanding in this culminating extract from <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="title-book-JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><i>Scientific Dialogues</i></span>.

                        occurs among Franklinian explanations of “unusual” manifestations of electricity in nature—a chapter that follows a more systematic treatment of the progress of electrical theory. 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span> exhibits no command of that sustained investigation; rather, <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span>‐like, he dips into a miscellany, which is reflected in <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>ʼs title enumerating the “unusual appearances” in <span class="persName-JP">Priestley</span>ʼs 
                        original, a list of the electrical sublime—<span class="title-lesson-JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUESATMOSPHERICELECTRICITY">“On Atmospheric Electricity—Of Falling Stars—Of the Aurora Borealis—Of Water‐spouts and Whirlwinds—Of Earthquakes”</span>.
                        In <span class="persName-JP">Priestley</span>ʼs <span class="title-book-PRIESTLEYHISTORYOFELECTRICITY"><i>History</i></span>, these wonders pose challenges to grasping the electrical principles that pervade them. 
                        The aurora borealis is hypothesized as arising from “the flashing of electric fire from positive towards negative clouds at a great distance”, 
                        a phenomenon made possible when the upper atmosphere becomes heated. Just so, <span class="persName-JP">Priestley</span> confirms, recent experiments with the mineral <span class="name--TOURMALINE">tourmaline</span> 
                        reveal that it “will, without friction, both emit and absorb the electric fluid, only by the increase or diminution of its heat”

                        Investigations of the electrical properties of <span class="name--TOURMALINE">tourmaline</span> were conducted by the German physicist

                        by heating the mineral, a positive charge collects on one face of the crystal and a negative charge on the opposite face. This discovery, a historian explains, 
                        was interpreted as strongly favoring “the Franklinian doctrine that there were two contrary modes of electrification possible in nature—called 
                        by <span class="persName-BF">Franklin</span> ‘plus’ and ‘minus’”

                        <span class="persName-FUTA">Aepinus</span>ʼs Latin treatise on electricity and magnetism was circulated among British electricians, including <span class="persName-JP">Priestley</span>
