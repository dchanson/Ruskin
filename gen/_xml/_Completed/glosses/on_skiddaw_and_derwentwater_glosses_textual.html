                    but otherwise the lines were considerably revised. The illusory fortresses in the clouds are elaborated with additional military spectacle, and then the figure 
                    of cloud watching launches a new simile comparing the actions of an “urchin boy” (“Towers, banners, spears, and battlements appear, / Chasing each other off; and in their turn /

                    (“And towers, and battlements, and all appear / Chasing the others off, and in their turn / Are chasèd by the others”).

                    “<span class="geogName-SKIDDAW">skiddaw</span> come”, to the indicative, “<span class="geogName-SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</span> came”—and he runs this phrase into <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs following line of <span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span>, 
                    “noble and grand and beutious clothed with green” (“<span class="geogName-SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</span> came, / Noble, and grand, and beauteous, clothed with green”). While the omission was obviously <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs choice,

                    of line 20 in <span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span> is barely legible, and the grammar strained, as the speaker changes perspective to lean into this detail: the “root” in line 19 is “straggling” in line 20 
                    “as it push its branches from the cliff”. The revision overwritten in ink—the two lines, “a straggler. there as tho grow with stone for earth / 
                    and bare and scraggy as befit the cliff”—is scarcely clearer in its grammar, but one understands that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was shifting from the energy of “push” 
                    to the picturesque aspect of scragginess. Later in the draft, at line 37 (in the <span class="geogName-DERWENTWATER">Derwent Water</span> section of the poem), <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> returned to the overwritten line, recovering its energy in a more coherent version of the image: 
                    “A stragller pushes forth its branches stiff”.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">In the fair‐copy poem (<span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>), lines 20–21 present a clearer version of the two lines overwritten in ink in <span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span>: 
                        the “root” in line 19 of the draft has become a “bush”, described as “A straggler with its roots fixed in the stone / And bare and scraggy as befits the soil”. 
                        The draftʼs second occurence of the “straggler”—the line, “A stragller pushes forth its branches stiff”—no longer appears in the <span class="geogName-DERWENTWATER">Derwent Water</span> section or anywhere else in the fair copy. 
                        It is possible, therefore, that the lines overwritten in ink atop lines 20–21 of <span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span> represent <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        returning to revise this passage, after he composed line 37, “A stragller pushes forth its branches stiff”.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">This possibility underpinned <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs interpretation: “line 19 of ‘Skiddaw’ in its final state

                        occurs among the lines of ‘Derwentwater’”; and so he followed what he believed to be evidence of “the authorʼs own after-thoughts” 
                        in <span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span>, unaware that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had omitted the line altogether in the

                        In brief, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> retained <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs initial pencil draft of lines 20–21 
                        in <span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span>, rejecting the ink overwritten lines in favor of the version of the image at line 37: 
                        “A bare, terrific cliff precipitous / Descends, with only here and there a root, / 
                        A straggler, pushing forth its branches stiff”.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs interpretation does not appear in the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>, 
                        since <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> ignored his editing of the <span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span> draft, 
                        deeming it superceded by the <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> fair copy. In the revision made for the <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span>, 
                        however, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs ideas seem adopted from both draft and fair copy. The word “straggler” does not appear at all, 
                        but the original image of tenacity (“a bush” or “root” “fixed” to the “bare terrific cliff preciptate”, 
                        surviving “in the stone / And bare and scraggy as befits the soil”) is developed as part of a simile that connects this image 
                        with the preceding observation of changing cloud shapes. In this revised version, the “dissolving” shapes of the clouds 
                        are like the friable “mould” that is loosened by a mischievous “urchin boy”, who tramples the soil that had been 
                        “bound” by the “roots tenacious”. The idea of the pushing branches seems also present, suggested by the image 
                        of a root that, in the figurative sense of a “spoiler” (i.e., <i>despoiler</i>), invades the hidden eagle nest. 
                        The pushing, however, has now become clandestine.</div></span><br><br>

                        the verb tense is governed by the appositional phrase, “the fleecy locks of winter”, which “fall” and “form”. In <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i></span> (<span class="date-1891">1891</span>),

                        The <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span> adopts the solution in <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>,

                        <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> continued to address the problem by inserting, like <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>, editorial punctuation, in this case an em‐dash:

                    Since the word “Play” is capitalized and roughly centered at the top of a page, however, the word can also be interpreted,

                    however, the line might represent a start on dialogue spoken by one of the French characters in the play. The fair copy of the play

                    Since these deletions and substitution are not reflected in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> fair copy, one can infer that the revision postdated that version;
