                    (MS IA, <i>g</i>.1; MS IX; <i>Poems</i> [1891]; <i>Works</i> [1903])—</b>The 
                    editor of <a href="/notes/poems_1891_note" target="_self">Ruskin, <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i> (1891)</span></a>, 
                    <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span>, comments: “The second line of <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">‘Calais’</span> reads 
                    in the original, ‘The ocean barrier is beating’, which must be a mis‐transcription of an insufficiently altered rough copy, now lost, 
                    as the reading is neither rhyme nor reason” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS4D1891" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i> [4<sup>o</sup>, 1891]</span></a>, 1:280–81 n. 28; 
                    <a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS8D1891" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i> [8<sup>o</sup>, 1891]</span></a>, 1:282, n. 28). 
                    As a substitution, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> devised his own line, printing it in square brackets, as shown in the <span class="date-1891">1891</span> witness, 
                    <a href="/witnesses/calais_poem_poems_1891" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">‘Calais’ [poem]</span></a>. 
                    The editors of the <a href="/notes/library_edition_note" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span></a> disagreed; and in 
                    the <span class="date-1903">1903</span> witness of <a href="/witnesses/calais_poem_le" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">“Calais” [poem]</span></a>, 
                    they restored <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs original line, 
                    arguing that “the young author, as we have seen in the case of the <a href="/apparatuses/iteriad_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">‘Iteriad’</span></a>, 
                    was not always careful to get a true rhyme, and [that] the meaning [of the original line 2 of <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">‘Calais’</span>] is clear enough” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self">Ruskin, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 2:341 n. 2). 
                    In fact, the use of the term <i>barrier</i> is significant; see <a href="/notes/bibliography#HANSONRUSKIN1830S" target="_self"><span class="persName-DCH">Hanson</span>, <span class="title-essay-HANSONRUSKIN1830S">“Ruskin in the 1830s”</span></a>.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">In hypothesizing a “rough copy, now lost”, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> evidently meant a draft version preceding not only 
                        the <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IX</span> fair‐copy witness of <a href="/witnesses/calais_poem_msix" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">“Calais” [poem]</span></a>, 
                        but also the <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span>, witness of <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">“Calais” [poem]</span>—the 
                        earliest extant version, which is in the hand of <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, and which shows interlinear corrections by his son. 
                        In the latter version, line 2 is identical to that in the fair‐copy version. Thus, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> was familiar with the 
                        <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span> version, and he was referring to this manuscript as the one containing 
                        the “original” version of <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">“Calais” [poem]</span>, while hypothesizing a “lost” rough copy behind it. 
                        From the <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span> version, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> did accept lines 5–6 
                        as originally composed in <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs hand, rejecting <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs revision of those lines in that same manuscript. 
                        The <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span> manuscript is the sole surviving witness 
                        of lines 5–6, which <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> preferred, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> having carried his own, 
                        not his fatherʼs, version of these lines to the <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IX</span> fair copy.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">In arriving at his published version of <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">“Calais” [poem]</span>, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> 
                        appears therefore to have based his editorial decisions on his own aesthetic judgment, since his choices overall are consistent neither with the “original” 
                        <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span> version in <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs hand 
                        nor with the fair‐copy <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IX</span> version in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs (and with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs 
                        interlinear revisions in <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span>, on which the fair copy is based). <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> 
                        even substituted a line of his own invention for one he disliked in both holograph versions. The editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-ETC">E. T. Cook</span> and <span class="persName-">Alexander Wedderburn</span>, seem somewhat more consistent 
                        in preferring <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs final, fair‐copy version, although their decisions are as eclectic and aesthetically driven as 
                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs in accepting the latterʼs re‐punctuation of the poem in combination with some punctuation 
                        found in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs fair copy. In the case of <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">‘Calais’</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-">Wedderburn</span> likewise clearly had access to the witnesses “in both the rough and in the fair copy”, 
                        as they call them—meaning, by the “rough” witness, 
                        what they referred to as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs “fatherʼs copy”, 
                        the <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span> version 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self">Ruskin, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 2:341 n. 2).</div>
