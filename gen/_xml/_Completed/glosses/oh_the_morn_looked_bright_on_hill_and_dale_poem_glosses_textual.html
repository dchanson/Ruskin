                    the two printed versions, the editors placed a full stop after “levied,” but the period belongs after “hills.” The sense, subtracting the restrictive clause
                    (which is not truly restrictive), is that the stream flowed among the hills. If punctuation were added to clarify <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs intention correctly,
                    commas should set off the (non)restrictive clause, along with a period following “hills”:
                    “Flowed a small tributary stream, / That the Rhine levied, all between / The frontlets of the fair fresh hills.”</div></span><br><br>
