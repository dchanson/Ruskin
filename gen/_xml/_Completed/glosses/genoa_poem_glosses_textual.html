                    <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, twenty-six lines beginning with this line first appear on 64r–v, divided by a horizontal line from the preceding titled draft of the poem,
                    <span class="title-poem-JRLAGODICOMO">“Lago di Como”</span>, and divided by another line space from the following untited poem,
                    <span class="title-poem-JRLAGOMAGGIORE">“It was an eve of summer, mild” [<span class="geogName-LAKEMAGGIORE">“Lago Maggiore”</span>]</span>. On 79r,
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> repeats the line “Of various trees a vista green”, followed by a metadiscursive mark <i>&c.</i>
                    He also copies the next two lines from 64r, again followed by a metadiscursive mark <i>&.</i>, plus the final line of the earlier poem, from 64v
                    (lines 1395–98 of <span class="title-poem-JRGENOA">“Genoa”</span> in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>). A metamark
                    above the final line copied from the earlier poem, <i>XXX</i>, perhaps signifies the end of the lines previously composed.
                    The metadiscursive marks presumably indicate that the full twenty‐six lines on 64r–v are to be inserted at that designated point of the draft of <span class="title-poem-JRGENOA">“Genoa”</span>,
                    an intention that is supported by the correspondingly metadiscursive symbol of four asterisks that follow the final, twenty‐sixth line of the earlier poem on 64r–v.
                    As another metadiscursive mark confirming this intention, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> notated the line from the earlier poem,
                    “Whose living crystal shot between <span class="metamark-insertion">&.</span>” with the numeral 50, and the line
                    “When all that there you look upon”—the latter line (deleted in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>) marking
                    the end of the inserted passage (along with a few additionally composed lines), which do approximately number thirty lines. Taking all these cues,
                    <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> without comment inserted the lines transferred from the earlier poem into the text of
                    <span class="title-poem-JRGENOA">“Genoa”</span> printed in <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i> (<span class="date-1891">1891</span>)</span>
                    (but omitting the additional lines that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> deleted in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>),
                    and the editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> followed suit, without remarking on the transferred lines forming a separate unit earlier in the manuscript.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> might have added these asterisks to the earlier poem after starting <span class="title-poem-JRGENOA">“Genoa”</span> later in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>,
                        there are no grounds for necessarily treating the twenty‐six lines of <span class="title-poem-JROFVARIOUSTREES">“Of various trees a vista green”</span> as a fragment;
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may initially have considered these lines as forming a self‐standing poem about the journey from <span class="placeName-MILAN">Milan</span>
                        to the <span class="geogName-MEDITERRANEAN">Mediterranean Sea</span>. Similarly, there are no grounds for supposing
                        that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> jumped ahead from 64r–v to compose <span class="title-poem-JRGENOA">“Genoa”</span> fifteen pages later,
                        or that he in any way departed from the sequential composition as the poems and essays appear in this section of the notebook.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Respecting the sequence of composition at this stage in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, one can broadly remark that, following draft of a cluster of poems concerning crossing the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>
                        (see <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">“Passing the Alps”</span></a> and glosses),
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> reverted to drafting prose for the earlier Belgian segment of the journey, presumably in order to keep pace with his simultaneous
                        fair‐copying and illustration of that portion of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">"Account"</span> in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>. Interspersed with these essays, he introduced verse about northern <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>,
                        his invention logically adverting first to the Italian lakes, as the geographical introduction to <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> following an <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alpine</span> crossing from the north.
                        He composed a poem about <span class="placeName-CHIAVENNA">Chiavenna</span>, <span class="title-poem-JROHSOFTLYBLEW">“Oh softly blew the morning breeze”</span>, and
                        <span class="title-poem-JRLAGODICOMO">“Lago di Como”</span>, and then this poem about the journey south to <span class="placeName-GENOA">Genoa</span>.
                        He skipped writing about <span class="placeName-MILAN">Milan</span>, because he had already composed <span class="title-poem-MILANCATHEDRAL">“Milan Cathedral”</span>
                        in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG2">MS IA, g.2</span>. Thus, the vista of a “rich and mighty plain” that opens at the start of this poem
                        refers to the country south of <span class="placeName-MILAN">Milan</span>, and the poem surveys a wide panoramic arc from north to south.</div>

                    that he did intend that the “sportive light ran / Thither and thither fast”, receding rapidly away from the spectator “through / That natural arched avenue”,
                    and not that the light ran randomly “hither and thither” on the surface of the water.</div></span><br><br>

                    but the following adjectival phrases, “White as the wreathed salt sea spray / With the snow wreaths that ever press”, read less redundantly
