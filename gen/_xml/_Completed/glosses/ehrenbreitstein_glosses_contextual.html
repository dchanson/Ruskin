                    <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft, alterations that were abandoned for the original version in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>

                    earlier rough drafts of poetry. Alternatively, it is possible that the revisions in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> were not ignored 
                    in <span class="date-1833-1834">1833–34</span> when fair‐copying the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>,

                    The hand in which the changes are made in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> does appear to be that of the younger

                    the hill of <span class="geogName-EHRENBREITSTEIN">Ehrenbreitstein</span>, fortifications of the same name had been erected from Roman through medieval times. In <span class="date-1833">1833</span>, 
                    scarcely any vestige remained of the ancient architecture, the fortress having been destroyed by French troops in <span class="date-1801">1801</span> and rebuilt by <span class="placeName-PRUSSIA">Prussia</span> after <span class="date-1815">1815</span>, 
                    as a practical enforcement of its power in <span class="date-1803-1815">post‐Napoleonic</span> <span class="placeName-EUROPE">Europe</span>. Despite the now utilitarian character of the works, 
                    artists and tourists persisted in romanticizing the site (<a href="/notes/bibliography#TAYLORCASTLES" target="_self"><span class="persName-RRT">Taylor</span>, <span class="title-TAYLORCASTLES"><i>Castles of the Rhine</i></span></a>, 98–111). 
                    <span class="persName-GGB">Lord Byron</span> helped to popularize the site by commemorating the recent conflict over the fortress in canto 3 (<span class="date-1816">1816</span>),

                    admitted no illusions about the regrettable loss of the antique ruins, but could still perceive the artistic appeal of the site: 
                    “The whole surface of the rock glowed with the richest hues of sunset; its naturally deep‐toned and richly‐coloured form assuming an endless diversity of tints, 
                    combined into a focus of harmonious light, and relieved by the broad shadows of the surrounding objects. A multitude of beautiful parts subdued to a general breadth of effect 
                    will be the description best understood by the learned in art. . . . Beautiful as it is, crowned by the pride of modern masonry, and the intricate contrivances of modern engineering, 
                    it possessed far more romantic beauty in the former dismantled state of the shattered fortress bearing the picturesque traces of ruthless violence”

                    was described by the artist <span class="persName-JML">James Mathews Leigh</span>, writing from <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span> at about the same time as the Ruskinsʼ journey: 
                    “I was . . . startled at the cries which accompanied the apparent destruction of the bridge of boats, fragments of which were floating away 
                    from the main body. . . . A majestic raft of the largest dimensions was floating down the river to its ultimate destination. The measured voices of the innumerable rowers 
                    who laboured at either end of the enormous mass had an imposing effect as they mingled with the splashings of their ample paddles. The <i>deck</i> was covered with their cabins, 
                    and at different points were elevated stations from which the word of command was given by tongue of trumpet. No notion can be formed of the quantity of timber employed in these rafts 
                    from a sight of their extended forms on the water. . . . [T]here are sometimes from seven to nine hundred workmen and rowers employed. 
                    The largest rafts are generally from seven to nine hundred feet long and seventy broad, and are composed of the produce of <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span>, the <span class="geogName-BLACKFOREST">Black Forest</span>, 
                    and the fir forests of the <span class="geogName-MURG">Murg</span>, which is brought to <span class="placeName-DORDRECHT">Dordrecht</span>, there to be distributed and conveyed to the various foreign and domestic markets. . . . 
                    This striking object passed majestically through the gap in the bridge, and in a very short time the barges were rejoined and the promenaders resumed their stations [on the bridge]”
