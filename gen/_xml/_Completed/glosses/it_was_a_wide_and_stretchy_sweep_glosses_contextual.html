                    which encircled the interior of the buildingʼs dome, but the subordinate exhibits, which surrounded the building on its perimeter. By the time of the

                    had begun encircling the structure with pleasure gardens, which contained a bewildering variety of attractions, amongst which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>

                        The scene in the print opens out to a large fountain from inside a “treillage pavilion” designed in the manner of <span class="persName-HR">Humphry Repton</span>. 
                        This pavilion apparently was never built at the <span class="placeName-building-COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</span>, but the aquatint includes a garden seat fancifully 
                        speared by a reptile, its head protruding from one end, its tail curling outward from the other end, and its legs forming the stoolʼs frame. With unconscious irony, 
                        the printʼs caption highlights the heterogeneous mixing of styles and objects: the scene “represents the south side of the grounds which surround the building, 
                        embracing a picturesque trait of the beautiful union of Greek Architecture, thus judiciously combining with plants and flowering shrubs. The view is taken from the 
                        Corridor or covered way, leading from the interior of the structure [the trellised pavilion] to the first Fountain, whose refreshing showers are felt delightfully cooling 
                        after the ascent to the Gallery of the <span class="title-artwork-HORNORSLONDONPANORAMA">Panorama</span>, 
                        and the circuit of the Pavilion enriched with so great a treasury of art. This enchanting spot leads through delightful alleys formed by extensive greenhouses, 
                        abounding in all the richest productions of <span class="persName-fictional-FLORA">Flora</span>, from almost every region, to the <span class="placeName-building-SWISSCOTTAGECOLOSSEUM">Swiss Farm‐House</span>, 
                        from the verandah of which will be viewed the Rocky Scene, with the stupendous Water‐falls, and other objects, characteristic of the romantic and picturesque region 
                        which it is intended to describe. This part of the great scheme, when completed, it is believed, will amount to an illusion, having been prepared 
                        with rare skill and at a vast expense”. Thus, the printʼs caption leads the viewer from the crocodile stools shown in the printʼs foreground 
                        to the other seemingly disassociated object mentioned in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs lines, the <span class="placeName-building-SWISSCOTTAGECOLOSSEUM">Swiss Cottage</span>.

                        The statue depicted a reclining figure, called the “sleeping undine” (or <i>ondine</i>, a nymph), which lay at the center of a “veil of water” 
                        thrown upward and around the figure, and falling down onto shells, corals, and mosses, as a “dial of shells” revolved above—the whole enclosed inside a glass dome topped with a flowery finial

                        p. 40; plate 3, p. 37 opp.). The enclosed design of the fountain, along with its connection to a subterranean passage decorated with shells and fossil specimens, suggests a grotto—a 
                        classical feature in picturesque landscape design, which hearkened back to Greek mythology and to the Roman <i>nymphaeum</i> or fountain consecrated to water nymphs

                        Less arbitrarily miscellaneous than <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> believed, the experience of the undine fountain was completed, according to the caption of the Ackermann print, 
                        when “the spectator . . . [is] led [from there] to the various splendid apartments” of the <span class="placeName-building-SWISSCOTTAGECOLOSSEUM">Swiss Cottage</span>.

                        and into the passage leading “<span class="smallcaps">TO THE SWISS COTTAGE</span>”.) The tunnel seems to have been planned more deliberately than as a utilitarian pathway from one 
                        “work . . . of matchless art” (the undine fountain) to another (the cottage “which, when completed, will be the wonder of the age”)

                        much like that at <span class="placeName-building-STOURHEAD">Stourhead</span>, which likewise featured a marble sleeping nymph,

                        The exhibit was built in the pleasure gardens outside the <span class="placeName-building-COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</span>, 
                        adjacent to two of the buildingʼs angled polygonal sides. It featured an exterior façade (see the <span class="date-1845">1845</span> watercolor reproduced in

                        but the main attraction seems to have been its four full‐scale room interiors. The grandest room, as described and illustrated in the

                        and carved in imitation of the ornamented dwelling of a Swiss family”. An engraving features a carved fireplace projecting into the room, large enough 
                        to accommodate built‐in settles cozily near the fire—“the very <i>beau ideal</i> of cottage comfort”. 
                        With its “raised hearthstone, massive fire‐dogs and chimney‐back, and its cosy seats”, the fireplace was “calculated to contain 
                        a whole family seated at the sides of its ample hearth” and was considered “characteristic of the primitive enjoyments of the happy people 
                        from among whom this model was taken”. The rustic furnishings shown in the engraving, carved as if formed from forest‐tree branches, reinforced the idea of the primitive

               <div class="p">The <span class="placeName-building-SWISSCOTTAGECOLOSSEUM">Swiss Cottage</span> was designed by an architect, <span class="persName-PFR">Peter Frederick Robinson</span> 
                        (<span class="date-1776-1858">1776–1858</span>), whose eclectic collections of designs for domestic architecture included Swiss‐inspired buildings, 
                        which he based on observations taken during a Continental tour of <span class="date-1816">1816</span>. In his book,

                        he provides floor plans and elevations, as well as full renderings in landscape settings, of a “Swiss Cottage” and a “Swiss Farm House”

                        he adapts the Swiss chalet style (as well as several other styles) to villa architecture. As <span class="persName-JSACKERMAN">James Ackerman</span> comments, 
                        <span class="persName-PFR">Robinson</span>ʼs “major contribution was his expansion of the canon of acceptable historical styles” for villa and cottage designs. 
                        This eclecticism was an outgrowth of the shift in the aesthetics and sociology of the British villa—from emulation of <span class="persName-AP">Palladio</span> by elites 
                        in the earlier eighteenth century, entailing the Platonic notion that architecture imitated nature conceptually, “exemplifying the principles of harmony in the universe”, 
                        to the revolution in taste for the picturesque, entailing a psychology of associationism and democratic individualism, allowing “the designer to give his work 
                        whatever character he believed to be suited to his client, the nature of the setting, or the function of the building”

                        standing in for the landscape shown surrounding the structures in the culminating plate for each set of designs. (Swiss scenes featured prominently in the illusions presented nearby

                        In <span class="title-book-"><i>Rural Architecture</i></span>, the design for a Swiss cottage is pictured in an Alpine valley, 
                        rather than in an English suburb. Just so, as promised in the caption to the Ackermann aquatint, <span class="persName-THP">Hornor</span> 
                        contrived an Alpine setting for the full‐scale <span class="placeName-building-SWISSCOTTAGECOLOSSEUM">Swiss Cottage</span>, a scene visitors could view 
                        through its windows. According to the <span class="title-periodical-MIRROROFLITERATURE"><i>Mirror of Literature</i></span>, 
                        across from the fireplace in the main room, a large recessed window bay commanded “a view of a mass of rock‐scenery, ornamented with waterfalls 
                        of singular contrivance and effect”—the “mock waterfalls” mentioned by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>. “The frames [of the windows] are filled in 
                        with plate‐glass, so that the view of these artificial wonders is unobstructed”. The effect of the scenery, the writer enthused, 
                        conveyed “the character of the <i>sublime in miniature</i>”

               <div class="p"><span class="persName-THP">Hornor</span>, as an experienced landscape architect and surveyor, was able to complement his main attraction, the enormous panorama, 
                        with these miniature scenes—“illusions” seemingly on a sublime scale, yet contained within a mere four acres of grounds surrounding the building. 
                        As the topographer and antiquarian, <span class="persName-JBRITTON">John Britton</span> (<span class="date-1771-1857">1771–1857</span>), wrote in an 
                        <span class="date-1829">1829</span> pamphlet about the <span class="placeName-building-COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</span>, <span class="persName-THP">Hornor</span>ʼs 
                        “art had the necromantic or talismanic power of creating mountains, dells, cascades, and the most delicious scenes of Paradise from a small and limited piece of flat land”. 
                        The charm of the sublime in miniature still held in <span class="date-1848">1848</span>, when <span class="persName-EMW">Edward Mogg</span> in his touristʼs guide 
                        to <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> remarked that the gardens around the <span class="placeName-building-COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</span> were 
                        “laid out so as to appear much more extensive than they really are, and comprise conservatories, waterfalls, fountains, a Swiss cottage, a marine cave and grotto, all of beautiful construction”

                        (The “verandah” of the cottage from which the Rocky Scene could also be viewed, according to the Ackermann description, appears in an

               <div class="p">The cottage remained standing in <span class="date-1855">1855</span>, when its “roof, walls, and projecting fireplace” could still draw the admiration 
                        of the journalist, <span class="persName-JTA">John Timbs</span>, for their “fancifully carved” ornament

                        The Rocky Scene, however, reflected the ups and downs of the <span class="placeName-building-COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</span>ʼs fortunes over the years. 
                        After <span class="persName-THP">Hornor</span>ʼs bankruptcy and flight to <span class="placeName-USA">America</span> (see 
                        <a href="/notes/colosseum_note" target="_self">The Colosseum, <span class="persName-THP">Hornor</span>ʼs London Panorama, and Regentʼs Park</a>), 
                        the <span class="placeName-building-COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</span> was taken over in <span class="date-1835">1835</span> by a famous singer and entrepreneur, 
                        <span class="persName-JBRAHAM">John Braham</span> (<span class="date-1777-1856">1777–1856</span>), who had great ambitions to develop the attractions. 
                        These plans failed to prosper, however, and the <span class="placeName-building-SWISSCOTTAGECOLOSSEUM">Swiss Cottage</span> gained only a miserable eagle, 
                        the survivor of a shuttered menagerie. While the bird perched haplessly on the miniature scenery outside the windows, refreshments were sold on the inside 
                        by a Cockney in Swiss costume. Later, in <span class="date-1845">1845</span>, another entrepreneur oversaw a more successful re‐opening, for which the Swiss scenery 
                        was refreshed by a theater‐scenery painter named <span class="persName-GDANSON">George Danson</span> (<a href="/notes/bibliography#HYDECOLOSSEUM" target="_self"><span class="persName-RHYDE">Hyde</span>, <span class="title-book-HYDECOLOSSEUM"><i>The Regentʼs Park Colosseum</i></span></a>, 42, 49, 52, 44). 
                        The waterworks for the scenery apparently originated with <span class="persName-THP">Hornor</span>—the “singular contrivance and effect” of a mountain cascade, as reported by the 
                        <span class="title-periodical-MIRROROFLITERATURE"><i>Mirror of Literature</i></span>, having consisted in “real water” being 
                        “interspersed” among the “mountain‐scenery”, which according to <span class="persName-JTA">Timbs</span> was “executed by 
                        <span class="persName-THP">Mr. Hornor</span>” in his excess of “enthusiasm”. <span class="persName-GDANSON">Danson</span> apparently now enhanced the moving‐water effects by 
                        erecting “the snow‐clad peak of <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span>” in the center of the scene, flanked on one side 
                        by a model of the <span class="geogName-MERDEGLACE">Mer de Glace</span>, and on the other side by a “Mountain Torrent”, which went “leaping over 
                        the nearest rocks, [and came] . . . roaring down the precipices; and after forming a small lake in front of the cottage windows [in spite of the year‐round “Glaciarium”?] 
                        overflow[ed] its stony basin, and, with a second fall, disappear[ed] in the gulf below”. According to the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>London Illustrated News</i></span>, 
                        the scene offered “unquestionably, the finest specimen of Model Scenery executed in this country”

                    book 21, chapters 35–37, <span class="persName-LIVY">Livy</span> relates that <span class="persName-HANNIBAL">Hannibal</span>ʼs army reached the summit 
                    of an <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alpine</span> pass having suffered great losses in the climb upward. <span class="persName-HANNIBAL">Hannibal</span> encouraged 
                    the men by leading them to an eminence from which they could survey the plains of <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> below. Yet the descent threatened to become 
                    even more treacherous than the ascent, since wintry weather had rendered the barren ground slippery with snow and ice, which the pack animals made worse by trampling 
                    into a slurry. At this crisis, the army advanced by using a technology that, while crude, would have evoked a modern parallel for post‐Napoleonic readers, 
                    as the editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> seem to suggest by their choice of the term, “blasting operations”. 
                    Like their ancient Carthaginian counterparts, the modern French invading armies made their way into <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> by blasting and engineering 
                    operations to improve the navigability of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alpine pass</span>. The relevant passage in <span class="persName-LIVY">Livy</span>ʼs

                        with great difficulty, so much snow was there to be dug out and carried away. The soldiers being then set to make a way down the cliff, 
                        by which alone a passage could be effected, and it being necessary that they should cut through the rocks, having felled and lopped a number of large trees 
                        which grew around, they make a huge pile of timber; and as soon as a strong wind fit for exciting the flames arose, they set fire to it, and, 
                        pouring vinegar on the heated stones, they render them soft and crumbling. They then open a way with iron instruments through the rock thus heated by the fire, 
                        and soften its declivities by gentle windings, so that not only the beasts of burden, but also the elephants could be led down it. Four days were spent 
                        about this rock, the beasts nearly perishing through hunger: for the summits of the mountains are for the most part bare, and if there is any pasture the snows bury it. 
                        The lower parts contain valleys, and some sunny hills, and rivulets flowing beside woods, and scenes more worthy of the abode of man. 
                        There the beasts of burden were sent out to pasture, and rest given for three days to the men, fatigued with forming the passage:
