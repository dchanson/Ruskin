                    the <span class="geogName-LORELEI">Lorelei</span>. <span class="persName-MURRAY">John Murray III</span> explains: “In front of the <span class="geogName-LORELEI">Lurleiberg</span> is the whirlpool (Wirbel), called the Gewirr, and above it a rapid, called the Bank, 
                    formed by the stream dashing over a number of sunken rocks, encreased by the sudden bend which the river here makes. The passage of the large rafts 
                    which navigate the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> over this spot is difficult and dangerous, and men have been washed overboard by the tumultuous waves dashing over the slippery plank. 
                    The perils of this spot, taken in connexion with the mysterious echo, no doubt gave birth to the superstition that the <span class="geogName-LORELEI"><i>Lurlei</i></span> 
                    was haunted by a spirit, a beauteous but wicked water‐nymph, who distracted and beguiled the passing boatman with her magical voice, 
                    only to overwhelm and drown him in the waves of the whirlpool”

                    (MS VIII; MS IX; <i>Works</i> [<span class="date-1903">1903</span>])—</b>In reviewing places along the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> in terms of psychological categories 
                    of aesthetic response, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> continues the theme of contrast of sublimity and serenity in the flow of the river, on which his poem about <span class="placeName-STGOAR">St. Goar</span> turns. 
                    These contrasting modes of representation and response would have been supported by the drawings completing the MS IX fair copy. According to the 
                    <a href="/witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii#ACCOUNTTOCSTGOARILLUS" target="_self"><span class="title-bibliography_text-JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTSILLUS">List of Proposed Additional Contents for the “Account”—Table 2 (Illustrations)</span></a>,

                    the thirteenth‐century castle ruin that rises above the town of <span class="placeName-STGOAR">St. Goar</span>, would have complemented 
                    the headpiece drawing of the <span class="geogName-LORELEI">Lorelei</span> whirlpool below the town. Before and after the <span class="placeName-building-RHEINFELS">Rheinfels</span> drawing, 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> planned to feature the prominences on opposite sides of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>

                    While referring to the deep sea, the drowned men may distantly allude to the legend of the <span class="persName-fictional-LORELEISIREN">Lorelei siren</span>, 
                    which is noticeably absent from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem about <span class="placeName-STGOAR">St. Goar</span>. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> avoids even naming the <span class="geogName-LORELEI">Lorelei</span> hill, 
                    referring in the poem only to the weatherbeaten “rock” around which the river bends. It is possible that the Ruskins were unacquainted with the legend: 
                    although traceable to the fifteenth century, the story of the siren had been brought to life comparatively recently, in the first three decades of the nineteenth century, 
                    in poetry by <span class="persName-CBRENTANO">Clemens Brentano</span> (<span class="date-1778-1842">1778–1842</span>), <span class="persName-JVE">Joseph von Eichendorff</span> (<span class="date-1788-1857">1788–1857</span>), and <span class="persName-HHEINE">Heinrich Heine</span> (<span class="date-1797-1856">1797–1856</span>); and the popularization of <span class="persName-HHEINE">Heine</span>ʼs poem in art song,

                    one of that pretty amphibious class of spirits which is called <i><span class="persName-fictional-UNDINE">Undine</span></i>. Below this rock is the well–known whirlpool, called the Gewirr; 
                    and nothing but the most resolute determination not to listen to her sweet beguiling voice can save the navigators who pass it from being engulphed”
