                    <span class="persName-JBM">Jacques Balmat</span> (<span class="date-1762-1834">1762—1834</span>), an agricultural laborer and crystal hunter, 
                    born to an established peasant family in the <span class="geogName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix Valley</span>, who gained fame as the first man known to discover a passage for ascending to the top of <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span>. 
                    <span class="persName-JBM">Balmat</span> completed the ascent on <span class="date-1786-08-08">8 August 1786</span> in the company of <span class="persName-MGP">Michel‐Gabriel Paccard</span> (<span class="date-1757-1827">1757–1827</span>), a physician with an enthusiasm for natural history, 
                    who belonged to well‐educated <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</span> family.</div>
               
               <div class="p">In his poem, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> summarizes the story of <span class="persName-JBM">Balmat</span>ʼs discovery of the passage, which he found on the morning following “the night whose stormy might” he “braved” alone, 
                        having been left behind on the mountain by a group of climbers who were competing to achieve the summit, and whom <span class="persName-JBM">Balmat</span> had joined as an unwelcome interloper. 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs most likely source for the story was <span class="title-book-SAUSSUREVOYAGES"><i>Voyages dans les Alpes</i></span> 
                        by <span class="persName-HBS">Horace‐Bénédict de Saussure</span>, a book that the family borrowed when staying in <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</span> 
                        and studied for its account of the ascent of <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span>, according to <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span>. Later, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs father presented him with <span class="persName-HBS">Saussure</span>ʼs multivolume <span class="title-book-SAUSSUREVOYAGES"><i>Voyages</i></span> as a gift for his <span class="date-1834-02-08">8 February 1834</span> birthday

                        In <span class="date-1787">1787</span>, a year after <span class="persName-JBM">Balmat</span> and <span class="persName-MGP">Paccard</span> successfully climbed to the summit, and <span class="persName-JBM">Balmat</span> claimed <span class="persName-HBS">Saussure</span>ʼs prize for discovery of the passage, <span class="persName-HBS">Saussure</span> himself made an expedition to the summit, 
                        led there by guides including <span class="persName-JBM">Balmat</span>. The narration of this ascent forms the climax of the volume of the <span class="title-book-SAUSSUREVOYAGES"><i>Voyages</i></span> 
                        that contains the story of <span class="persName-JBM">Balmat</span>ʼs surviving his lonely ordeal of the night storm, awakening to find the path to the summit.</div>
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-HBS">Saussure</span> had spurred the race to gain the summit of <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span> by offering a prize to the first man to achieve it, 
                        although <span class="persName-PHH">Peter H. Hansen</span> argues that a more compelling motivation arose from a growing sense of sovereignty of self, 
                        which in eighteenth‐century <span class="placeName-SAVOY">Savoy</span> was supported by emancipation from feudal dues, a consequent sense of enfranchisement from ages of effective serfdom, and belief in republican ideas. 
                        <span class="persName-PHH">Hansen</span> also comments on the reputation of heroic masculinity that <span class="persName-HBS">Saussure</span> attached to <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</span> peasants like <span class="persName-JBM">Balmat</span>, romanticizing their dangerous pursuits 
                        amid the mountain heights of chamois hunting and exploring for the “crystal” (quartz and other mineral) specimens to sell to collectors. Competitive masculinity contributed significantly 
                        to both bonding and tension between <span class="persName-JBM">Balmat</span> and <span class="persName-MGP">Paccard</span> in their joint venture to reach the summit, <span class="persName-PHH">Hansen</span> speculates,

               <div class="p">In his poem, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> portrays <span class="persName-JBM">Balmat</span> as heroically masculine, a quality he may have derived not only from <span class="persName-HBS">Saussure</span>ʼs account, but also from tales about <span class="persName-JBM">Balmat</span> that the family heard 
                        when staying in <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</span>. <span class="persName-JBM">Balmat</span> was still alive in <span class="date-1833">1833</span>; and in the previous year, his fame had been given a new boost by

                        <span class="persName-JBM">Jaques Balmat</span>, devenu depuis célebre par
                        son ascension à la cime du <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont‐Blanc</span>. Il
                        ne devoit point être de cette course, il se
                        joignit à <span class="persName-FPACCARD">Paccard</span> & à sa troupe presque malgré eux. En revenant du dôme du Gouté,
                        comme il nʼétoit pas trop de bonne intelligence avec les autres, il marchoit seul, &
                        sʼéloigna même pour aller chercher des
                        crystaux dans un rocher écarté. Lorsquʼil
                        voulut les rejoindre, ou du moins suivre
                        leurs traces sur la neige, il ne les retrouva
                        pas; sur ces entrefaites lʼorage survint, il
                        nʼosa pas se hasarder seul, au milieu de ces
                        déserts par lʼorage & à lʼentrée de la nuit, il préféra de se blotir dans la neige & dʼattendre patiemment la fin de lʼorage & le
                        commencement du jour; il souffrit là beaucoup de la gréle & du froid; mais vers
                        le matin le tems sʼéclaircit, & comme il
                        avoit tout le jour pour redescendre, il résolut dʼen consacrer une partie à parcourir
                        ces vastes & inconnues solitudes, en cherchant une route par laquelle ont pût parvenir à la cime du <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont‐Blanc</span>. Cʼest ainsi
                        quʼil découvrit celle quʼon a suivie & qui
                        est bien certainement la seule par laquelle
                        en puisse lʼatteindre.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">De retour à <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</span>, il tint dʼabord
                        sa découverte secrette. Mais comme il apprit
                        que le <span class="persName-MGP">D. Paccard</span> pensoit à faire quelques tentatives dans le même but, il lui
                        communiqua son secret & lui offrit de lui
                        servir de guide. Le succès de cette entreprise a été connu du public par les relations quʼen ont données le <span class="persName-MGP">D. Paccard</span> &

                     <div class="p">Il y a ceci de remarquable dans la découvette de cette route, cʼest que cʼest celle qui se présente le plus naturellement

                        <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</span>, & que cʼest aussi celle quʼont
                        tenue les premiers qui ont essayé dʼy monter; mais on sʼen étoit dégoûté par une
                        singuliere prévention. Comme elle suit une
                        espece de vallée entre de grandes hauteurs,
                        on sʼétoit imaginé quʼelle étoit trop chaude
                        & trop peu airée. Cette vallée est cependant bien large, bien accessible aux vents,
                        & les glaces qui en forment le fond & les
                        parois, ne sont pas propres à la réchauffer.
                        Mais la fatigue & la rareté de lʼair donnoient, à ceux qui firent les premieres tentatives, cet accablement dont jʼai souvent
                        parlé; ils attribuerent ce mal‐aise à la chaleur & à la stagnation de lʼair, & ils ne chercherent plus à atteindre la cime que par des
                        arrêtes découvertes & isolées comme celle
                        du <span class="geogName-DOMEDUGOUTER">Gouté</span>. Les gens de <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</span> croyoient

                        <span class="persName-JBM">Jaques Balmat</span>, en y passant la nuit, dissipa
                        cette crainte; & lʼimpossibilité de parvenir
                        en passant sur les arrêtes, contraignit à

                        and <span class="persName-MPACCARD">Michel Paccard</span>, cousins of <span class="persName-MGP">Dr. Michel‐Gabriel Paccard</span>, who were racing another party to the summit of <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span> via the <span class="geogName-">Dôme du Goûter</span>] 
                        by way of the <span class="geogName-MONTAGNEDELACOTE">Montagne la Côte</span> was <span class="persName-JBM">Jaques Balmat</span>, who has since been celebrated for his ascension to the summit of <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span>. 
                        He was not supposed to be part of this group effort; he joined <span class="persName-MGP">Paccard</span> and his group almost against their wishes. On his way back from the <span class="geogName-DOMEDUGOUTER">Dôme du Goûter</span>, 
                        because he was not on good terms with the group, he walked alone and even went to look for mineral specimens in a rock formation off the beaten path. 
                        When he wanted to rejoin them, or at least to follow their tracks in the snow, he couldnʼt find the tracks; in the meantime, a storm had developed, and he dared not proceed alone, 
                        in the middle of the wilderness during a storm and at the fall of night. He preferred to burrow into the snow and wait patiently for the end of the storm and the break of day; 
                        he suffered a great deal from the hail and the cold; but toward morning the weather cleared, and as he had the entire day to descend, he resolved to consecrate a portion of this time 
                        to wandering among these vast and unknown empty places while searching for a route by which one could reach the peak of <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span>. This is how he discovered that route which one follows now, 
                        and is almost certainly the only one by which the summit can be reached.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Back at <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</span>, he at first kept his discovery secret. But when he learned that <span class="persName-MGP">[Michel‐Gabriel] Paccard</span> thought to make some attempts 
                        to achieve the same goal, he told him his secret and offered to act as his guide. The success of that enterprise has become known to the public by the accounts given by 
                        <span class="persName-MGP">Paccard</span> and <span class="persName-MTB">[Marc‐Théodore] Bourrit</span> [artist and musician, a leader of the <span class="placeName-GENEVA">Geneva</span> republicans, who had himself attempted to reach 
                        the summit of <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span>, and who had published a proposed route via the <span class="geogName-AIGUILLEDUGOUTER">Aiguille</span> and <span class="geogName-DOMEDUGOUTER">Dôme du Goûter</span>].</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">What is remarkable about the discovery of this route is that itʼs the most obvious one to those who look at <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span> from <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</span>, and it’s also the one taken by those who first tried to climb the mountain; 
                        but they had been turned back by a distinctive obstacle. As the route follows a sort of valley between very high walls, the assumption had been that it was too hot and too little aired. 
                        This valley is nevertheless quite large, quite accessible to wind, and the ice, which forms its bottom and sides, keeps it from heating up. 
                        But fatigue and the thinness of the air created, in those who made the first attempts, that oppression of which I have often spoken; 
                        they attributed this malaise to heat and the stagnant air and they did not make any further efforts to get to the peak except by the isolated and known ridges like the <span class="geogName-DOMEDUGOUTER">Gouté</span>. 
                        The people of <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</span> also thought that sleep would be fatal at these great elevations, but the test of this theory made by <span class="persName-JBM">Jaques Balmat</span>, by passing the night there, dissipated this fear; 
                        and the impossibility of advancing by traversing the ridges constrained one to take the route that was the best known and the most natural.</div>

                        while a search was made for <span class="persName-JBM">Balmat</span>ʼs body. The search proving unsuccessful, a funeral was finally held in <span class="date-1835-01">January 1835</span> 
                        (<span class="persName-PHH">Hansen</span>, 165; <a href="/notes/bibliography#OXLEYJACQUESBALMAT" target="_self"><span class="persName-TLO">Oxley</span>, <span class="title-book-OXLEYJACQUESBALMAT"><i>Jacques Balmat</i></span></a>, 32–34). 
                        Even then, news of <span class="persName-JBM">Balmat</span>ʼs death must have taken time to reach England. In <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, the draft of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem precedes poetry for his fatherʼs <span class="date-1834-05">May 1834</span> birthday, 
                        on which he began work as early as <span class="date-1834-02">February 1834</span> 
                        (see <a href="/apparatuses/msviii_apparatus#LISTB2" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII"><i>MS VIII: Contents, b.2</i></span></a>). 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, if occasioned by any particular event, was certainly not a memorial to the heroʼs death, but more likely was prompted by the receipt of <span class="persName-HBS">Saussure</span>ʼs 
                        <span class="title-book-SAUSSUREVOYAGES"><i>Voyages dans les Alpes</i></span> for his <span class="date-1834-02-08">8 February 1834</span> birthday.</div>
               
               <div class="p">Beyond <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="date-1834">1834</span> poem, the index to the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> contains no further entries on <span class="persName-JBM">Balmat</span>, but the story of the <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</span> peasantʼs ordeal on the mountain, rewarded by his discovery of the path to the summit, 
                        continued to be told in many versions published throughout the nineteenth century. In a popular account of the <span class="date-1850-1859">1850</span>s, based on an exploit that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> scorned as a “Cockney ascent of <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span>” 
                        (<span class="title-letter-"><span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span> to <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</span>, <span class="date-1851-08-16">16 August 1851</span></span>, in <a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 36:117), 
                        the journalist and lecturer, <span class="persName-ARS">Albert Smith</span> (<span class="date-1816-1860">1816–60</span>), profited from his ascent to the summit 
                        (he had to be carried up, much of the way) by producing a long‐running theatrical extravaganza, in which he guided his audiences on a virtual climb up the mountain. 
                        From <span class="persName-ARS">Smith</span>ʼs first visit to <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</span> in <span class="date-1838">1838</span> (when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was publishing his essays on the picturesque, 
                        <span class="title-essay-"><i>The Poetry of Architecture</i></span>, in which he lamented the effects of Swiss dioramas and panoramas), 
                        the entrepreneur combined his travel experience with technologies of visual culture to entertain audiences with visual illusion. His first contrivance was a lecture 
                        illustrated by a toy panorama, the “Alps in a box”. His next, the show entitled <span class="title-exhibition-SMITHASCENTOFMONTBLANC"><i>The Ascent of Mont Blanc</i></span>, 
                        created “panoramania” among London audiences at the <span class="placeName-building-EGYPTIANHALL">Egyptian Hall</span>,

                                    <span class="persName-JBM">Jacques Balmat</span>,—who appears just at this time not
                                    to have been very popular in the valley [of <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</span>],—had presented himself without invitation, and followed them against their will. When they turned to descend
                        they did not tell this poor man of their intention.
                        Being on unfriendly terms with them, he had kept
                        aloof; and whilst stopping to search for some crystals,
                        under a rock, he lost sight of them, just as the snow
                        began to fall, which rapidly obliterated their traces.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">The storm increased, and not daring to expose himself to the dangers of a solitary descent in the darkness, he resolved to spend the night, alone, in the
                        centre of this desert of ice, and at an elevation of
                        <i>fourteen thousand</i> feet above the level of the sea!</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">He had no food, and was but poorly clad; night
                        was rapidly coming on, and the frozen flakes fell more
                        heavily every minute. He therefore got under the
                        lee of one of the rocks, and contrived to heap up
                        against it sufficient snow to form a kind of niche, into which he crept, and blockaded himself as well as he
                        was able, from the storm. And there—an atom on
                        the ghastly and immeasurable waste of eternal frost
                        that extended on every side around him, in awful
                        unearthly silence, unbroken by any sound from the
                        remote living world—half dead already from the piercing cold, and with limbs inflamed and stiffened by
                        the labour he had already undergone, he passed the
                        long uncertain hours of that terrible night.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">At last morning broke. Far away in the east <span class="persName-JBM">Balmat</span>
                        saw its earliest lights rising behind the giants of the
                        <span class="geogName-BERNESEALPS">Bernese Oberland</span> who guarded the horizon, and one
                        after another the <span class="geogName-JUNGFRAU">Jungfrau</span>, <span class="geogName-EIGER">Eiger</span> and the <span class="geogName-FINSTERAARHORN">Finsteraarhorn</span> stood out bright and sharp in the clear cold air.
                        The storm had cleared altogether; the morning was
                        calm and mild; comparatively so even at that elevation; and as <span class="persName-JBM">Balmat</span> painfully endeavoured to move his
                        almost paralyzed limbs into action, he found that his
                        feet had lost all sensation—they were frostbitten!
                        He could, however, move them, and without pain.
                        The night frost had hardened the snow; presently
                        the sunlight came down the top of <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span> to the
                        <span class="geogName-">Dome du Gôuté</span> [sic], and then, still keeping up his courage
                        through everything, this brave fellow determined
                        to devote the day to surveying the mountain, and
                        seeing if any practicable course to the summit presented itself on the vast and hitherto untrodden
                        deserts of snow. His courage was rewarded: he found that if the crevices that border the <span class="geogName-GRANDPLATEAU">Grand Plateau</span> were once crossed, the path to the top of <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont
                        Blanc</span> was clear and unbroken before him, and he
                        then traced out the route, which has, with little variation, been followed ever since, and which appears to
                        be, beyond doubt, the only practicable one.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p"><span class="persName-JBM">Balmat</span> returned that evening to <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</span>, and
                        his energy was all exhausted by the time he reached
                        the village. He took to his bed immediately, and
                        did not leave it for weeks. Nobody knew of his success. He kept his secret close, until, moved with
                        gratitude to <span class="persName-MGP">Dr. Paccard</span>, the village physician, for his
                        great care and attention, the line of road was hinted
                        at, and an attempt agreed upon as soon as <span class="persName-JBM">Balmat</span>
                        recovered.</div>
