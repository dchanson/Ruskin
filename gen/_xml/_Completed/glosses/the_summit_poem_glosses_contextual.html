                    <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alpine</span> memorial crosses, which were erected in memory of travelers who met with accidents, put <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in mind of a 
                    <span class="geogName-LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</span> tourist, <span class="persName-CGOUGH">Charles Gough</span>, who fell to his death in <span class="date-1805">1805</span>, 
                    when attempting to traverse <span class="geogName-HELVELLYN">Mount Helvellyn</span>. He apparently lost his footing when attempting to cross <span class="geogName-STRIDINGEDGE">Striding Edge</span>, 
                    and his body ended among the rocks below, near <span class="geogName-REDTARN">Red Tarn</span>, where his remains were found three months later, 
                    still being watched over by his terrier, <span class="name--FOXEY">Foxey</span>. The incident achieved near legendary status owing to the dogʼs 
                    perceived loyalty. Poems in the epitaph tradition were composed about the story by <span class="persName-WW">William Wordsworth</span> 
                    (<span class="title-poem-WORDSWORTHFIDELITY">“Fidelity”</span>) and by <span class="persName-">Walter Scott</span>

                        collected in <a href="/notes/bibliography#MORLEYGOUGH" target="_self">Morley, <i>The Unfortunate Tourist of Helvellyn</i></a>. Whereas letters and newspaper accounts 
                        near in time to the discovery of <span class="persName-CGOUGH">Gough</span>ʼs remains speculated about the circumstance of the accident—mentioning the dog 
                        mainly to remark on the bizarre coincidence of her having given birth to a litter while remaining near the body, and to debate whether she or other scavengers had eaten 
                        away the flesh of the corpse—<span class="persName-WW">William Wordsworth</span>ʼs and <span class="persName-">Walter Scott</span>ʼs poems 
                        shifted responses to admiration of the dogʼs tenacious loyalty. In <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, <span class="persName-EHL">Edwin Landseer</span> (<span class="date-1802-1873">1802–73</span>)

                        at her fallen masterʼs breast (in the manner of the romantic image of a lover lying prostrate on the lifeless body of the beloved) and the sublime terror 
                        of the looming heights from which <span class="persName-CGOUGH">Gough</span> fell (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#ORMONDLANDSEER" target="_self">Ormond, <i>Sir Edwin Landseer</i></a>, 102).</div>

                        As for <span class="persName-EHL">Landseer</span>ʼs painting, while widely reviewed when shown at the Royal Academy 
                        in <span class="date-1830">1830</span>, apparently no engravings were made, so it is unlikely that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was familiar with the image 
                        (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#ORMONDLANDSEER" target="_self">Ormond, <i>Sir Edwin Landseer</i></a>, 102).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Unusually, in this case, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> shares octosyllabic couplets with <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span> rather than with <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>, whose lines are alexandrines, 
                        rhymed in an octave pattern of ABABCCCB, a stanza more commonly credited to <span class="persName-ACS">Algernon Swinburne</span> (e.g., in <span class="title-poem-">“The Garden of Proserpine”</span>;

                        However, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs narrator seems indebted less to <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span> 
                        than to <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>, in swerving to a meditative voice (“I thought as, by the cross I past”). <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs

                        and his faithful <span class="name--FOXEY">dog</span>. <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> neither acknowledged nor provided a rationale 
                        for the omission, but one can infer that the presence of a story set in the English lakes would have jarred with the editorʼs conception of the

                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> would have been particularly put off by the inclusion of a tale set in the <span class="placeName-">Lake District</span>,
