                    described in this poem. <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span> declared the view “second only to the <span class="geogName-">Alps</span> in grandeur”

               <div class="p">In their guidebooks, both <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> and <span class="persName-JGE">J. G. Ebel</span> note that early morning, the time chosen by the Ruskins, 
                        was among the most advantageous—“when the Iris floats within the spray”, as <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> rhapsodizes—and <span class="persName-JGE">Ebel</span> 
                        urging that the spectacle also “must be seen at the fall of day, or even by moon‐light . . . when the whole country around is involved in darkness, and the cascade alone is illumined”. 
                        The most dramatic vantage point for viewing the falls when traveling from from <span class="placeName-SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</span>, <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> goes on, 
                        was to “to hire a boat from thence . . . , and descend the river, which already forms a succession of rapids, by no means dangerous under the guidance of a boatman accustomed 
                        to the river. When the increased celerity of the current and the audible roar announce that the skiff is approaching the falls, the steersman makes for the l. [left] 
                        bank, and lands his passengers under the picturesque castle of <span class="placeName-building-LAUFENCASTLE"><i>Lauffen</i></span>, situated on a high rock 
                        overlooking the fall, within the <span class="placeName-ZURICH">Canton of Zurich</span>. It is occupied and rented by an artist who speaks English, and charges 1 franc admission 
                        for each person. The advantage of approaching the fall on this side is, that nothing is seen of it until it is at once presented in its most magnificent point of view, 
                        from the little pavilion perched on the edge of the cliff immediately above it [the <i>Fischetz</i>]. Its appearance from the opposite side of the river is tame in comparison, and the first impression from thence, 
                        made by the finest cataract in Europe, will most probably prove disappointing”. <span class="persName-JGE">Ebel</span> agrees, but adds that, “as the cataract should be seen on every side, 
                        it is advisable to take a boat at Fischetz, and to go to the castle of Im-Wart”, since, despite its prospect on the cascade presenting “the greatest disadvantage”, “the passage 
                        is by no means dangerous, notwithstanding the waves are agitated” and “the tourist will be pleased 
                        at seeing the miniature representation of the cataract in the <i>camera obscura</i> that is placed in the boat”

                        The Ruskins followed this advice, <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> commenting that, after viewing the falls “from a gallery 
                        that projects over the river”, they crossed to the opposite side of the river and below the falls for another but “inferior” prospect that lost “grandeur”,
