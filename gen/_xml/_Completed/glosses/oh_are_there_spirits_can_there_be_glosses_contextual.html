               <div class="p"><b>“If there be sprites in earth or air, / They surely have their dwelling there” (MS VIII)—</b>The 
                    poem seems suggested by <span class="persName-fictional-MANFRED">Manfred</span>ʼs invocation of the “Spirits of Earth and Air” 
                    in <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>ʼs <span class="title-drama-BYRONMANFRED"><i>Manfred</i></span> (I.i.41). The spiritsʼ “dwelling there” in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem refers, 
                    probably, to the mountains, as in <span class="persName-fictional_person-MANFRED">Manfred</span>ʼs call to “Mysterious Agency! / Ye spirits of the unbounded Universe! / Whom I have sought in darkness and in light— / Ye, who do compass earth about, and dwell / 
                    In subtler essence—ye, to whom the tops / Of mountains inaccessible are haunts, / And earthʼs and oceanʼs caves familiar things”, although <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>ʼs spirits haunt many places, 
                    “Earth, ocean, air, night, mountains, winds” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#BYRONWORKS" target="_self"><span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>, <span class="title-book-BYRONWORKS"><i>Complete Poetical Works</i></span>, ed. <span class="persName-JJM">McGann</span></a>, 4:54, 57 [I.i.28‐34, 132]).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">An association with <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>ʼs play may have been suggested by the account of the poetʼs <span class="date-1816">1816</span> Continental journey, which traced a path similar to the Ruskinsʼ, 
                        and which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> could have read in <span class="persName-TM">Thomas Moore</span>ʼs edition of the <span class="title-book-BYRONLETTERSJOURNALSMOORE">Letters and Journals of Lord Byron</span>, which the family acquired in about <span class="date-1833-12">December 1833</span>, 
                        three months following their return home (<a href="/notes/bibliography#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY" target="_self"><span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span>, <span class="title-book-DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><i>Library of John Ruskin</i></span></a>, 231‐32). 
                        In <span class="persName-TM">Moore</span>ʼs glossing of <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>ʼs impressions of his Alpine journey with lines afterward composed for <span class="persName-fictional-MANFRED">Manfred</span>, he selects, 
                    however, only instances of the terrific and violent sublime, such as views of natureʼs ruin from the cliffs and glaciers of the <span class="geogName-JUNGFRAU">Jungfrau</span> 
                    (I.ii.66‐69, 75‐78, 85‐87; II.iii.4‐8) or of high cataracts in the valleys (II.i.1‐8)

                        By comparison, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs tone seems amazed but serene and reverential, more akin to Victorian fairy lore.</div></span><br><br>
