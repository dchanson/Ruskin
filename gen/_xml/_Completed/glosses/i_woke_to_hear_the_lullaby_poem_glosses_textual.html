               <div class="p"><b>Title (MS VIII; <i>Poems</i> [<span class="date-1891">1891</span>]; <i>Works</i> [1903])—</b>The 
                    title which was first applied to this poem in <a href="/notes/poems_1891_note" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i> [1891]</span></a>, 
                    <span class="title-poem-JRARVEATCHAMOUNI">“The Arve at Chamouni”</span>, was invented by 
                    <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span>, who printed the title in square brackets to indicate his responsibility. 
                   <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> does not explain his rationale, but a persuasive case can be made for the poem's association with the prose section that immediately precedes it in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft, 
                    <span class="title-essay-JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">“Source of the Arveron”</span>, which is likewise set at <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</span>. 
                    Contiguity of the two drafts in MS VIII does not in itself prove that the two texts are related: most of the adjacent 
                    texts in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> clearly do not form verse/prose pairs 
                    that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> meant to fair-copy together in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> as a topographical unit. 
                    In <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, he was drafting verse and prose as needed for his sequential progress through the fair copy (a fair copy that, at the date when he started drafting in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, 
                    had reached only so far as the end of the northern <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span>/<span class="placeName-BELGIUM">Belgium</span> sections and the start of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> journey), while at the same time he was ranging ahead in drafting 
                    verse and prose segments related to <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> and <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span> 
                    (see <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus#COMPPUB" target="_self">Account of a Tour on the Continent: Composition and Publication</a>). 
                    Here at the outset of the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft, however, he does appear to have composed a unit consisting of a prose and verse segment describing the same place, 
                    the source of the glacial tributary, the <span class="geogName-ARVERON">Arveyron</span>, and its flow into the <span class="geogName-ARVE">Arve River</span> in the <span class="placeName-CHAMONIX">Chamonix valley</span>.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Details in the poem suggestively complement features in the preceding essay, reinforcing the compositional unit. 
                    Just as the essay <span class="title-essay-JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">“Source of the Arveron”</span> begins by describing a “reverie”, 
                    a “stilly dreamy waking vision”, the poem begins with the speaker awakening into sleep, as it were, 
                    by waking to hear a lullaby. The lullaby is sung by a river that, although unnamed in the poem, flows like the <span class="geogName-ARVERON">Arveyron</span> and the <span class="geogName-ARVE">Arve</span> through mountain scenery, 
                    its voice joining “every mighty mountain stream”. This river, however, has a “monotonous” sound that one would associate with a broader current, 
                    perhaps explaining why <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> connected the poem with the <span class="geogName-ARVE">Arve</span> rather than the <span class="geogName-ARVERON">Arveyron</span>. 
                    Another detail linking the poem with the essay is the trope of a morning sunrise, which complements the essayʼs evening sunset—paired tropes that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intertwines further 
                    by mentioning in the poem the “melancholy smile / On natures features” as evening descends.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Thus, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs title, <span class="title-essay-JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">“Source of the Arveron”</span>, which in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft appears attached exclusively 
                    to the prose essay following the title, must be intended as a section head belonging to both the following prose and verse segments. 
                    In fact, this can be the only explanation for a title appearing in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft since, by the time <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> started composing the 
                    <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> in that notebook, 
                    he had already begun the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy in which titles pertained only to composite‐genre units of verse, prose, and illustration. Had he fair‐copied 
                    <span class="title-essay-JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">“Source of the Arveron”</span> in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>—and that title does appear toward the end of the 
                        <a href="/witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii#ACCOUNTTOCSOURCEOFTHEARVERON" target="_self">Proposed Table of Contents for the Account of a Tour on the Continent</a>—he 
                    presumably would have adhered to the fair copyʼs pattern of leading the unit with a vignette‐style illustration followed by the section title, and then by the fair‐copied poem and the prose essay.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> errs, then, not so much in the title he gives to <span class="title-poem-JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY">“I woke to hear the lullaby”</span>—for 
                    <span class="title-poem-JRARVEATCHAMOUNI">“The Arve at Chamouni”</span> is apt enough—as in the giving the poem any title at all. 
                    His most questionable decision lies in separating the poems from the prose in the first place, to form a version of the 
                    <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> solely in verse—a version that, 
                    if it ever conceptually existed at all, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had abandoned after composition of the first five poems about towns in northern <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span> and <span class="placeName-BELGIUM">Belgium</span>.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> does use the title <span class="title-poem-JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERONPOEM">“The Source of the Arveron”</span> (he adds the article), 
                    but assigns it to another poem, which is untitled in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft, 
                    <span class="title-poem-JRTHEFOAMGLOBES">“The foam globes round come riding fast”</span>. This poem falls later in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs 
                        draft of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, amid draft of the prose section for “<span class="placeName-HEIDELBERG">Heidelberg</span>”. 
                    Unlike <span class="title-poem-JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY">“I woke to hear the lullaby”</span>, this poem identifies its subject explicitly as the <span class="placeName-ARVERON">Arveyron</span>, 
                        and presents a more obvious complement topographically to the prose description of <span class="title-essay-JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">“Source of the Arveron”</span>. 
                        Whereas <span class="title-poem-JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY">“I woke to hear the lullaby”</span> 
                    complements the mood of reverie in the essay, <span class="title-poem-JRTHEFOAMGLOBES">“The foam globes round come riding fast”</span> complements 
                        the prose description of the glacier source of the stream.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">In the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>, in which the editors reunite the poems with their complementary prose sections, 
                        <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> do recognize that the title, <span class="title-essay-JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">“The Source of the Arveron”</span>, 
                        should serve as a section title, which they apply to the prose essay as well as, taking <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs cue, to the poem, 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRTHEFOAMGLOBES">“The foam globes round come riding fast”</span> which <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> entitled 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERONPOEM">“The Source of the Arveron”</span> 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 2:386–87).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">But how did <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intend to situate these two poems vis‐à‐vis the essay? In the

                        he lists titles for the <span class="placeName-CHAMONIX">Chamonix</span> cluster as follows. (It is unknown whether the proposed titles refer to composite sections, 
                        or to individual poems and essays, or to a combination. In <i>ERM</i>, these titles are treated as prospective composite sections.)</div>

                        journey to the valley, first sighting of <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span>, and the cultural mythology associated with these places. 
                        The second item corresponds to an extant poem about <span class="persName-JBALMAT">Jacques Balmat</span>ʼs discovery of the path to climbing the pinnacle of the mountain,

                        latter fitting the description of a “morning” piece precisely. The final three titles do not appear to be especially represented in surviving draft, 
                        while the late‐composed <span class="title-poem-JRTHEFOAMGLOBES">“The foam globes round come riding fast”</span> might conceivably have been placed 
                        at several points in this list—perhaps most consistently with the typical composite pattern, placed as the verse prelude to the essay, <span class="title-essay-JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">“Source of the Arveron”</span>.</div></span><br><br>
