                    conjectured that the word transcribed here as <i>däyle</i> should be read as <i><span class="placeName-KEHL">Kehl</span></i>—the 
                    name of the village directly east of <span class="placeName-STRASBOURG">Strasbourg</span>, across the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>—and 
                    <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs editing of the line and his justification were reprinted by the editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"> Library Edition</span>. 
                    According to <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>, “the word in the original is illegible”, so he based his interpretation on the poemʼs overall suggestion of locale 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS4D1891" target="_self"><i>Poems</i> [4<sup>o</sup>, 1891]</a>, 1:138, 283, and

                    But while the letters are formed uncertainly, and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> worried the handwriting in these opening two lines with pen strokes that are not quite strikethroughs, 
                    the letters are legible enough, and they certainly do not spell <i><span class="placeName-KEHL">Kehl</span></i>. I suggest that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> made a nonce word, <i>däyle</i>, 
                    either because he could not remember the name of the “merry” place in question, or because he was making a joke—an umlauted and grotesquely spelled word 
                    to rhyme with <i>dale</i>, signifying the quaintness of German language. Elsewhere in the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> does not hesitate to adopt a condescending attitude toward German culture, as in the prose section of <span class="title-essay-JREHRENBREITSTEINPROSE">“Ehrenbreitstein”</span> 
                    (see <a href="/notes/ruskins_and_germany_note" target="_self">The Ruskinsʼ Attitudes toward <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span></a>).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">All this said, with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs nonce word frustrating the identity of the poemʼs intended locale, <span class="placeName-WGC">Collingwood</span> was likely correct to infer that 
                        “the poem must refer to the dayʼs journey described in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>: 
                        ‘earliest morning saw us trotting over the bridge of boats to <span class="placeName-KEHL">Kehl</span>, and in the eastern light I well remember 
                        watching the line of the <span class="geogName-BLACKFOREST">Black Forest</span> hills enlarge and rise, as we crossed the plain of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>’”

                        While visiting <span class="placeName-">Strasbourg</span> on the French side of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>, the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskins</span> 
                        stayed the nights of <span class="date-1833-06-06-1833-06-07">6–7 June</span> on the German side in <span class="placeName-KEHL">Kehl</span>. This inconvenience was likely 
                        owing to the reputation of the “<span class="placeName-FRANCE">French</span> custom house on the opposite side” for being so “notoriously strict” 
                        that, as <span class="persName-JM">John Murray III</span> advised, “persons wishing to see merely <span class="placeName-STRASBOURG">Strasburg</span>” 
                        should “leave their carriage and baggage at <span class="placeName-KEHL">Kehl</span> and hire a calèche” to cross the pontoon bridge. 
                        <span class="persName-">Mrs. Trollope</span>, traveling in the same year as the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskins</span>, took the advice; 
                        and amusing herself by watching others being searched by the French officials, testified that she “never saw caution carried to so comic an excess”. 
                        The Ruskins refused, however, to sacrifice the comfort of their carriage for sight‐seeing in <span class="placeName-STRASBOURG">Strasbourg</span>, 
                        with the result that they had to vacate the vehicle to be searched, as <span class="persName-">Mary Richardson</span> complained

               <div class="p">The “walls” that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> mentions in the opening lines, along with the military metaphor of the surrounding hills that “ramparted” the plain, 
                        were appropriate associations with <span class="placeName-KEHL">Kehl</span>. In the seventeenth century, <span class="persName-KL14">Louis XIV</span>ʼs military architect, <span class="persName-SPV">Marshal Vauban</span>, designed fortifications 
                        on both sides of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>, at <span class="placeName-STRASBOURG">Strasbourg</span> and <span class="placeName-KEHL">Kehl</span>, guarding the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> crossing. 
                        The strategic position at <span class="placeName-KEHL">Kehl</span> was besieged and captured by the Austrians during the 
                        <span class="date-1792-1802">French Revolutionary Wars</span>, but later annexed by <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span>—“convert[ing] 
                        the peaceful German village” of <span class="placeName-KEHL">Kehl</span>, according to a British tourist in the early <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>, 
                        “into a menacing French fortification”. In fact, following the <span class="date-1814-11-1815-06">Congress of Vienna</span> 
                  <span class="placeName-KEHL">Kehl</span>ʼs fortifications were taken down and remained “at present . . . dismantled”, 
                        as <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> pointed out in <span class="date-1836">1836</span>, but remnants still could appeal to the imagination, 
                        and <span class="persName-SPV">Vauban</span>ʼs citadel remained standing across the river in <span class="placeName-STRASBOURG">Strasbourg</span>

                    In the diary kept by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs cousin, <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span>, 
                    she mentions passing through <span class="placeName-OFFENBURG">Offenburg</span>, <span class="placeName-BIBERACH">Biberach</span>, <span class="placeName-HAUSACH">Hausach</span>,

                    This is route CVIII in <span class="persName-MURRAY">Murray</span>ʼs <span class="date-1836">1836</span> <a href="/notes/bibliography#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836" target="_self"><i>Hand‐book for Travellers on the Continent</i></a> (pp. 448–50), 
                    a route that leads from the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> plain into the <span class="geogName-BLACKFOREST">Black Forest</span> via the valley of the <span class="geogName-KINZIGRIVER">Kinzig River</span>, 
                    starting at where this stream empties into the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> at <span class="placeName-KEHL">Kehl</span>. 
                    Here, on the western side of the  <span class="geogName-BLACKFOREST">Black Forest</span> facing the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>, the wooded heights are steep and the ravines narrow, 
                    as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem describes; and on the eastern side of the <span class="geogName-">Black Forest</span> nearer the headwaters of the <span class="geogName-DANUBE">Danube</span>, 
                    hills are more rounded and give way to plateaus—Ruskinʼs “south horizon!”

                        is called <span class="title-composite-JRSWISSCOTTAGESCOMP">“The Swiss Cottages”</span>. Since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem about the <span class="geogName-BLACKFOREST">Black Forest</span>, 
                        in keeping with other poems in the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>, is confined to the landscape, 
                        he likely intended a prose section and drawings to describe the cottages (which, presumably, were not actually “Swiss”, as described in the

                        This planned prose section is very likely represented by the prose fragment, <a href="/witnesses/it_was_a_wide_and_stretchy_sweep_prose_msviii" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-JRITWASAWIDESTRETCHYSWEEP">“It was a wide stretchy sweep of lovely blue champaign”</span></a>,
