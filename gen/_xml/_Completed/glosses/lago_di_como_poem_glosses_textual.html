               <div class="p"><b>“All along that quiet bay” (<i>Poems</i> [1891])—</b>Without 
                    signaling or explaining the intervention in his edition, <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> omitted the first ten lines as found in the sole known witness, the 
                    <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft; and he slightly revised the eleventh line, omitting the conjunction, “And all along that quiet bay”. 
                    The opening line of the draft, “It was a little peaceful bay”, is similar to line 11, which <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> made into the opening line 
                    of his version, thus sacrificing the sense of a refrain. The omitted lines are restored in the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> (see 
                    <a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self">Ruskin, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 2:374 n. 1).</div></span><br><br>

               <div class="p"><b>“And in the sleep of his profound / White villages shone silently”—</b>Writing four years later in 
                    <span class="title-essay-JRPOETRYOFARCHITECTURE1837_38"><i>The Poetry of Architecture</i></span> about villas on <span class="geogName-LAKECOMO">Lago di Como</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> quoted himself, re‐using but altering these two lines: “Nothing, in fact, can be more beautiful than the intermingling 
                    of these bright lines with the darkness of the reversed cypresses seen against the deep azure of the distant hills in the crystalline waters of the lake, 
                    of which some one aptly says, ‘Deep within its azure rest, white villages sleep silently’; or than their columnar perspective, as village after village catches the light, 
                    and strikes the image to the very quietest recess of the narrow water, and the very farthest hollow of the folded hills”

                    The <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> omits the insertion from the main copytext, rejecting the correction on the grounds that, 
                    in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> version, “the word o‐ar mak[es] two syllables”.</div></span><br><br>

                    omitted these two lines from the version of the poem in <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i></span>. 
                    The antecedent of the pronoun <i>it</i> is <i>gleam</i>. The omitted lines are restored
