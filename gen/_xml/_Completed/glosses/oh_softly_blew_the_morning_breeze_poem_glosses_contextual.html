               <div class="p">Presumably, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have meant <span class="title-composite-JRITALIACOMP">“Italia, Italia”</span> to function similarly to the poem

                        <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>. <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> places <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALYPOEM">“Italy”</span> 
                        between two sets of poems—one set about the Italian lakes region (<span class="title-poem-ROGERSCOMO">“Como”</span> and <span class="title-poem-ROGERSBERGAMO">“Bergamo”</span>), 
                        and the second about <span class="placeName-VENICE">Venice</span> (beginning with <span class="title-poem-ROGERSCOLLALTO">“CollʼAlto”</span> and 
                        <span class="title-poem-ROGERSVENICE">“Venice”</span>). <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> departs from <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs 
                        sequence, not in broad contours, but in placing his poems about the Italian lakes after <span class="title-composite-JRITALIACOMP">“Italia, Italia”</span>, 
                        rather than before that greeting to <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>.

               <div class="p"><span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> begins <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> by posing the rhetorical question, 
                        “Am I in Italy?”, a question that the narrator excitedly pursues with “Surprise, and doubt, and self‐congratulation”. 
                        <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> itself answers the narratorʼs mixed emotions as an oxymoron, a beautiful ruin—a place fallen into ruin 
                        <i>because</i> of its beauty:</div>

               <div class="p">Similarly, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> hails the warmth and exotic vegetation of <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>, which he contrasts with the “ruinʼd universe” 
                        of the mountainside they have left behind (see <a href="/witnesses/the_descent_poem_msviii" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHEDESCENT">“The Descent”</span></a> and associated glosses).
                        In this trope, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> extends beyond <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs historical reference 
                        to the Sack of <span class="placeName-ROMEANCIENT">Rome</span>, however, to suggest the Evangelical emphasis on the ruin of all Creation.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p"><span class="placeName-CHIAVENNA">Chiavenna</span> itself answered handsomely to this trope of tempting beauty, “the mountains preserv[ing] it from the northern winds, 
                        and render[ing] the climate very warm”, enabling the production of a wine that was “in much request”, according to <span class="persName-JGE">Ebel</span>

                        <span class="persName-JM">John Murray III</span> remarks that, while <span class="placeName-CHIAVENNA">Chiavenna</span> offered “very little . . . to interest the passing traveller”, 
                        the town was “picturesque” and “charmingly situated close under the mountains, which appear to impend over it”, 
                        yet lying “under an Italian sun, surrounded by hills clothed with the richest vegetation, with vines, figs, and pomegranates”

               <div class="p">Arrival in <span class="placeName-">Chiavenna</span> could also signal a first encounter with the classical world, as <span class="persName-MSA">Mariana Starke</span> emphasizes 
                        in an <span class="date-1833">1833</span> guidebook. 
                        Discussing the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alpine passes</span> in the time of anicent <span class="placeName-ROMEANCIENT">Rome</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-MSA">Starke</span> writes: “There were . . . two ancient roads over the <span class="geogName-RHAETIANALPS">Rhaetian Alps</span>, 
                        which opened a communication between <i><span class="placeName-COIRE">Curia</span></i> (the modern <span class="placeName-COIRE">Coire</span>) 
                        and <span class="placeName-MILAN">Milan</span>. The one traversed <span class="placeName-SPLUGEN">Splugen</span>, the other <span class="geogName-SEPTIMER">Mont Septimer</span>, 
                        and both met at <i><span class="placeName-CHIAVENNA">Clavenna</span></i>, now <span class="placeName-CHIAVENNA">Chiavenna</span>. . . . 
                        One of these mountain‐passes led from <span class="placeName-COIRE">Coire</span> on the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> 
                        (anciently called <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhenus</span>) to <i><span class="placeName-LAPIDARIA">Lapidaria</span></i> on the same river; 
                        and thence to <i><span class="placeName-SPLUGEN">Cuneus Aureus</span></i>, now denominated <span class="placeName-SPLUGEN">Splugen</span>. 
                        From <span class="placeName-SPLUGEN">Splugen</span> the road was carried on to . . . <i><span class="placeName-CHIAVENNA">Clavenna</span></i>, 
                        now <span class="placeName-CHIAVENNA">Chiavenna</span>, and <i><span class="placeName-COMO">Comum</span></i>, now <span class="placeName-COMO">Como</span>.
