                    guidebooks, which began appearing in <span class="date-1836">1836</span>, were not free from apodictic judgments about the superior good sense of the British, this sentiment about the wide differences 
                    between the “races” of the British and the French seems more typical of English observers arriving shortly after the victory at <span class="placeName-WATERLOO">Waterloo</span> 
                    than of English tourists arriving almost two decades after the reopening of the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span> 
                    (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#PARSONSWORTHTHEDETOUR" target="_self"><span class="persName-NTP">Parsons</span>, <span class="title-book-PARSONSWORTHTHEDETOUR"><i>Worth the Detour</i></span></a>, 184–88). 
                    For example, writing about his Continental tour of <span class="date-1817">1817</span>, the <span class="placeName-LIVERPOOL">Liverpool</span> Congregational minister, 
                    <span class="persName-TRAFFLES">Thomas Raffles</span> (<span class="date-1788-1863">1788–1863</span>), described his culture shock when coming in view of the port at <span class="placeName-DIEPPE">Dieppe</span>: 
                    “the land I had so ardently desired to see—the people with whom I had longed to mingle—the habits and the manners I had often contemplated at a distance, were now before me”. 
                    The first encounter shook him, as “multitudes” of women efficiently lent their arms to pull the English vessel into harbor: 
                    “Their dress—their language—their manners—their whole appearance, was quite new, and we felt in a moment that we were in a foreign land. It is scarcely 
                    conceivable that so few miles and hours should make so vast a difference in oneʼs feelings, and completely excite all that can be conveyed by the word <i>foreigner</i> 
                    in the bosom. It was not a little strange to hear a language which we had been accustomed to associate with every idea of polish and of elegance, 
                    chattered with amazing volubility by the motley group collected on the quay to witness our arrival”.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">If the French women disconcerted <span class="persName-TRAFFLES">Raffles</span>, the “military men” idly “sauntering” on the quay failed to “excite a very favourable impression in my mind 
                        of the French military character or costume. Their dress was extremely mean and slovenly”, and one “looked in vain for that bold and manly air—that dignified and 
                        noble independence, which are the usual indications of bravery, and generally associated with the profession of a soldier. . . . Are these, thought I, 
                        the men that have made monarchs tremble on their thrones, and kept the world in awe—were they such men as these that bore the eagles of <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span> 
                        to the gates of <span class="placeName-VIENNA">Vienna</span>, and reaped the laurels of <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span> on the fields of <span class="placeName-AUSTERLITZ">Austerlitz</span> and <span class="placeName-MARENGO">Marengo</span>”?</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Finally, it was brought home to <span class="persName-TRAFFLES">Raffles</span>ʼs traveling party that they had arrived “in a Catholic country” by the erection “on the pier” of an “immense crucifix of wood”,

                        whose robust figure and weather‐beaten countenance would form a fine subject for the pencil, crossed himself as he stood at the helm, and the vessel passed along”

                    (“a little France, a miniature picture”). Similarly, in her journal of the tour,

                    As guidebooks and travel accounts of the period shifted to more practical advice about arrival in Continental towns 
                    (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#PARSONSWORTHTHEDETOUR" target="_self"><span class="persName-NTP">Parsons</span>, <span class="title-book-PARSONSWORTHTHEDETOUR"><i>Worth the Detour</i></span></a>, 180–84), 
                    <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span> was sized up in terms of British travelersʼ complaints about difficulties in negotiating customs and finding lodging; see, for example, 
                    <span class="title-book-HEATHSANNUAL1832"><i>Heathʼs Picturesque Annual for <span class="date-1832">1832</span></i></span>, which warns that, in <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span>, 
                    “the communication between the strangers and natives is full of strife and wrangling or silent bitterness”

                    Whereas <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs account turns the abrupt transition from English character to French, separated only by the <span class="geogName-ENGLISHCHANNEL">Channel</span> crossing, into a topic for picturesque contrasts of scenery and costume, 
                    <span class="persName-JM">John Murray III</span>ʼs <span class="date-1836">1836</span> guidebook emphasizes the comforts of familiarity: <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span> “is half Anglicised and our language is generally spoken”

                        of entering a foreign scene through a city gate in <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHELAKEOFGENEVA">“The Lake of Geneva“</span>, 
                    the poem that opens <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>. In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs 
                    fixation on the picturesque feature of “peculiarly french” fishing boats, there is also perhaps a reflection of the most picturesque image in 
                    <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs poem, the “passage‐boat [that] swept gaily by, / Laden with peasant‐girls 
                    and fruits and flowers, / And many a chanticleer and partlet caged / For <span class="placeName-VEVAY">Vevay</span>ʼs market‐place—a motley group / 
                    Seen throʼ the silvery haze”—the scene that <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> 
                    chose to depict in his vignette heading this introductory poem. Typically what is lacking from <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs influence on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, 
                    however, is the older poetʼs crowded historical references. <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> uses the trope of the city gate to allude to the story in the 
                    <span class="title-book-ROUSSEAUCONFESSIONS"><i>Confessions</i></span> (<span class="date-1782-1789">1782–89</span>) by 
                    <span class="persName-JJRPHILOSOPHER">Jean‐Jacques Rousseau</span> (<span class="date-1712-1778">1712–78</span>), in which 
                    at age sixteen during his apprenticeship to a tyrannical watchmaker, <span class="persName-JJRPHILOSOPHER">Jean‐Jacques</span> returned to 
                    <span class="placeName-GENEVA">Geneva</span> from a country excursion too late to re‐enter the city gates; and in despair over the punishment 
                    his master would inflict on him for his lack of restraint and discipline, the youth determines to exile himself from his native city. 
                    Following this reference, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> reverses the trope to imagine youths entering <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>ʼs
