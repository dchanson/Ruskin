                    editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> felt justified in naming this section of prose and verse 
                    <span class="title-composite-JRTHERHINECOMP">“The Rhine”</span> without enclosing the title in square brackets, 
                    which would have indicated their responsibility for the title. 
                    Their reasoning, presumably, was that <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> had already published the poem, <span class="title-poem-JRTHERHINE">“The Rhine”</span> 
                    in <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i> (<span class="date-1891">1891</span>)</span>, 
                    with the poemʼs title as found in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span>; and the prose essay drafted in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, 
                    <span class="title-essay-JRTRADITIONSOFTHERHINE">“The traditions of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> have long been celebrated” [“The Rhine”]</span>, 
                    although untitled, surely must have been intended to be associated with that poem, since its related topic is announced in the first sentence. The association, however, is problematic.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">That <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intended a composite section centered on the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine River</span> appears likely; in fact, according to the 
                        <a href="/witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii" target="_self"><span class="title-bibliography_text-">List of Proposed Additional Contents for the “Account”</span></a>, 
                        he intended more than one—the sections named 
                        <span class="title-composite-JRFALLOFTHERHINECOMP"><span class="geogName-RHINEFALLS">“The Fall of the Rhine”</span></span> and 
                        <span class="title-composite-JRTHERHINECOMP"><span class="geogName-RHINE">“The Rhine”</span></span>. Questions remain, however, 
                        which (if either) of these two section titles were meant to contain (either or both) the poem in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span> and the essay in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, 
                        and indeed whether the poem and essay belong together in the same section at all. Of the two sections in the list named for the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>, the first, 
                        <span class="title-composite-JRFALLOFTHERHINECOMP"><span class="geogName-RHINEFALLS">“The Fall of the Rhine”</span></span>, 
                        is centered in <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span>, falling among a group of titles associated with the sighting of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> from <span class="placeName-SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</span>, 
                        prior to the familyʼs crossing into <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> (see the contextual glosses for 
                        <a href="/witnesses/there_is_a_charmed_peace_that_aye_poem_msviii" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRALPSFROMSSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">“There is a charmed peace that aye” [“The <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> from <span class="placeName-SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</span>”]</span></a>,

                        The second of the two <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> titles in the list, <span class="title-composite-JRTHERHINECOMP"><span class="geogName-RHINE">“The Rhine”</span></span>, is centered in <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span>, 
                        falling between the proposed sections <span class="title-composite-JRBASLECOMP"><span class="placeName-BASLE">“Basle”</span></span> and 
                        <span class="title-composite-JRBALSTALLCOMP"><span class="placeName-BALSTAHL">“Balstall”</span></span> (see the figure, <a href="/figures/balstall_drawing_msix" target="_self"><span class="title-artwork-JRBALSTALLMSIX">Balstall Drawing</span></a>, 
                        in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>, the sole piece of these sections to be created or survive). 
                        The respective contents of the poem and essay about the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> suggest that they should not be joined in the same composite section, but that the prose essay was meant for the German group, 
                        and the poem for the Swiss group. This division is consistent with the manuscript contexts in which the pieces respectively appear—the essay about the German <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> being 
                        consistent with most of the draft in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, which concerns northern <span class="geogName-EUROPE">Europe</span> and crossing the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> into <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>; and the poem about the Swiss <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> complementing the only other 
                        piece in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span> related to the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</span>,

                    to the portion of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine River</span> that runs through the south of <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span>, and to the <span class="geogName-HARZ">Harz Mountains</span> in the north. 
                    The Ruskins did not visit the <span class="geogName-HARZ">Harz</span> in <span class="date-1833">1833</span>. In his <span class="date-1836">1836</span> guidebook, <span class="persName-JM">John Murray III</span> adopts a tone of British superiority toward this district, if not toward the people 
                    as does <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in this essay: “<span class="geogName-BROCKEN">The Brocken</span>, the loftiest summit, is lower than the highest British mountains, but the <span class="geogName-HARZ">Hartz</span> chain rises alone immediately out of a level plain 
                    extending all the way to the <span class="geogName-BALTICSEA">Baltic</span>, whose inhabitants, accustomed to an uninterrupted flat, exaggerate both the elevation and the beauties of the only range of hills 
                    that fall within their observation. Their scenery would probably appear tame, and their height inconsiderable to one accustomed to the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>, in comparison with which the <span class="geogName-HARZ">Hartz</span> is a mere molehill”. 
                    <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> goes on to note, like <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, that the “district may indeed be considered the cradle of innumerable superstitions, some of them even now not extinct, of Gnomes and Cobolds, 
                    witches, and the headless horseman. Several odd‐shaped masses of granite around the summit of the <span class="geogName-BROCKEN">Brocken</span> are named after the witches; for example, the <span class="geogName-TEUFELSKANZEL">Devilʼs Pulpit</span> . . . ; 
                    the <span class="geogName-HEXENALTAR">Witchesʼ Altar</span>; and not far off, the Witchesʼ Lake. According to the well‐known legend, the witches hold their Sabbath on this spot once a‐year, 
                    upon the <i>eve</i> of May‐day, called in <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span> <i>Walpurgis nacht</i> from the name of a saint who converted the Saxons

               <div class="p">In contrast to this condescending introduction to the region, <span class="persName-FMT">Frances Trollope</span>, wrote an impressive account of her familyʼs experiences in the <span class="geogName-HARZ">Harz</span>,

                    on mules. She acknowledges that her imagination was colored by her prior appreciation of German romance, in the form of <span class="persName-JWG">Goethe</span>ʼs <span class="title-poem-GOETHEFAUST"><i>Faust</i></span> and

                    a thirteenth‐century castle ruin, considered “the most extensive ruin on the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>”, built on the hill above <span class="placeName-STGOAR">St. Goar</span>. 
                    Originally one of the many “robber‐nests” where the lord exacted duties from merchants passing on the river, in recent history the fortress had been surrendered in <span class="date-1794">1794</span> 
                    to the French Revolutionary Army and, a few years later, blown up

                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> refers to its “vaulted chambers” perhaps because the Renaissance portion of the castle included a vast vaulted cellar. In her travel diary, 
                    <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span> lists <span class="placeName-building-RHEINFELS">Rheinfels</span> among several sites passed en route at the end of <span class="date-1833-05">May 1833</span>, but she does not suggest that they stopped

               <div class="p">The nationalistic pride in the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> as a “German” river was a comparatively recent cultural development, as was the sentiment surrounding the ruined medieval

                        evoked in Rhinelanders feelings of rivalrous disunity and oppression rather than a unifying national feeling. For each settlement, the river represented 
                        a differently configured boundary and trade artery. Sentiments changed with the development of German Romanticism and taste for the picturesque in the time of <span class="persName-JWG">Goethe</span>, 
                        while a more unified German nationalism accompanied the political realignments that followed the defeat of <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span> and the dissolution of the Napoleonic German Confederation

               <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composed <span class="title-poem-JREMIGRATIONOFSPRITES">“The Emigration of the Sprites”</span> probably in the winter of <span class="date-1834-1835">1834–35</span>, 
                        likely inspired by <span class="title-book-BULWERLYTTONPILGRIMS"><i>Pilgrims of the Rhine</i></span> 
                        (<span class="date-1834">1834</span>) by <span class="persName-EBL">Edward Bulwer‐Lytton</span>, in which English fairies accompany a human couple on a tour of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> sets his tale in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>, 
                        where the sprites hold a council, complaining of neglect and disbelief by humans, and therefore proposing to emigrate to <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span> where legends of supernatural creatures are credited by the common people. 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs idea builds not only on <span class="persName-EBL">Bulwer‐Lytton</span>ʼs frame tale but possibly on the tradition, 
                        mentioned by <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> in his guidebook account of the <span class="geogName-BROCKEN">Brocken</span>, that on Walpurgisnacht on the mountaintop 
                        “all the evil spirits in the world assemble to offer allegiance to their unmentionable master” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836" target="_self"><i>Hand‐book for Travellers on the Continent</i></a>, 321).

               <div class="p">By rendering these sources as an English story, and framing the story as an inset tale, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> follows the same pattern he used for inserting another 
                        English narrative within a topographical poem describing a non‐English setting—his digression relating the <span class="geogName-LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</span> story of 
                        <span class="persName-CGOUGH">Gough</span> and his faithful dog (<a href="/witnesses/the_summit_poem_msviii" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHESUMMIT">“The Summit”</span></a>). 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> likely adopted this technique of digressing from topographical description to introduce variety of narrative from <span class="persName-SR">Samuel Rogers</span>, 
                        whose <span class="title-poem-"><i>Italy</i></span> introduces tales in this way to vary the symmetrical structures and forward geographical sequence 
                        of the poem. <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>ʼs stories, however, always pretend to be indigenous to the places where they occur in the poem. 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> prefers English stories, whether from familiarity or British pride or both.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">While the idea for <span class="title-poem-JREMIGRATIONOFSPRITES">“The Emigration of the Sprites”</span> may have originated with the framing introduction 
                        of a narrator that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> sets up at the end of this essay, <span class="title-essay-JRTRADITIONSOFTHERHINE">“The traditions of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> have long been celebrated” [<span class="geogName-RHINE">“The Rhine”</span>]</span>, 
                        by the time of composing the narrative poem he had likely abandoned any serious intention of uniting it with the essay in the unfinished fair‐copy of the 
                        <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>. He had moved on, just as <span class="title-poem-JREMIGRATIONOFSPRITES">“The Emigration of the Sprites”</span> 
                        advances beyond the octosyllabic couplets that predominate throughout the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>, 
                        to experiment with a twelve‐line stanza. The stanza continues to rely on octosyllabic lines, but consists of a quartet, sestet, and couplet, built from a more ambitious rhyme scheme 
                        (abba cdcdcd ee)—an improvisation, perhaps, on a stanza type in <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span> or <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>. Rather than planning the poem for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> perhaps destined it for the annuals—the public ambition that had swerved his attention from completing the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> in the first place,

                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> appears to use the name of the <span class="geogName-DINARICALPS">Dinaric Alps</span> similarly to his evocation of the <span class="geogName-RHAETIANALPS">Rhætian Alps</span>, to evoke distant boundaries 
                    of the imagination. Respecting knowledge of the <span class="geogName-RHAETIANALPS">Rhætian Alps</span>, however, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drew on the actual experience of following tributaries of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> into those mountains, 
                    whereas the <span class="geogName-DINARICALPS">Dinaric Alps</span> lay entirely beyond his ken. Even usage of the name appears to have been unusual in English at this time. 
                    The earliest usage of the adjective cited in the <span class="title-dictionary-OED"><i>Oxford English Dictionary</i></span> is from <span class="date-1833">1833</span> in the 
                    <span class="title-dictionary-PENNYCYCLOPAEDIA"><i>Penny Cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge</i></span>, 
                    which has this to say about the terrain of <span class="placeName-BOSNIA">Bosnia</span>: 
                    “<span class="placeName-BOSNIA">Bosnia</span> is a mountainous country and contains deep valleys. . . . The mountains are branches of the <span class="geogName-DINARICALPS">Dinaric</span> and <span class="geogName-JULIANALPS">Julian Alps</span>, which enter it on the side of <span class="placeName-AUSTRIA">Austria</span>. . . . 
                    The lower regions of the <span class="geogName-DINARICALPS">Dinaric range</span> are in many parts entirely naked, those immediately above them are covered with pines and rich pastures, 
                    and the uppermost consist of rocks thinly interspersed with wild rosemary, thyme, and other low plants” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#PENNYCYCLOPAEDIA" target="_self"><span class="title-dictionary-PENNYCYCLOPAEDIA"><i>Penny Cyclopædia</i></span></a>, 5:230 [<span class="date-1836">1836</span>], and see 1:387 [<span class="date-1833">1833</span>]). 
                    This region formed part of what at the time was called <span class="placeName-TURKEYINEUROPE">Turkey in Europe</span>, the western boundary of the <span class="placeName-OTTOMANEMPIRE">Ottoman Empire</span>. 
                    According to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs boyhood geography book, <span class="placeName-TURKEYINEUROPE">Turkey in Europe</span> had shifted the boundary of civilization. 
                    It comprised places that were “once the seat of civilization, learning, and the arts, includ[ing] ancient <span class="placeName-GREECE">Greece</span> and other countries, 
                    formerly the finest in the world, but, owing to the Mahometan religion, to the despotism of the government, and to the ignorant policy of the Turks”, these places had become “the most desolate and miserable”
