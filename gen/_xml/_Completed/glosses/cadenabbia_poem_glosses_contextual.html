                    (<span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>; <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i></span> [<span class="date-1891">1891</span>]; 
                    <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span> [<span class="date-1903">1903</span>])—</b>For the Ruskinsʼ excursion on <span class="geogName-LAKECOMO">Lake Como</span>, see 
                    <a href="/witnesses/lago_di_como_poem_msviii" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRLAGODICOMO">“Lago di Como”</span></a> and associated glosses. 
                    The town of <span class="placeName-LECCO">Lecco</span> lies at the bottom of the eastern leg of <span class="geogName-LAKECOMO">Lake Como</span>, corresponding to the town of <span class="placeName-COMO">Como</span> lying at the bottom of the western leg. 
                    The latter was the Ruskinsʼ ultimate destination. As they set out steaming southward on the lake in the “morning mild”, they did not turn at the fork toward the eastern leg and <span class="placeName-LECCO">Lecco</span>, 
                    but disembarked from the steamboat and were rowed to their resting place at <span class="placeName-CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</span> on the western bank, which they reached at four oʼclock in the afternoon. 
                    By referring at the start of the poem to the morning breaking over <span class="placeName-LECCO">Lecco</span>, and closing with “sunwaves”—altered in draft by the insertion of “sun‐red waves”—<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                    frames the poem as if contained in a single day, but in fact the journey from <span class="placeName-CHIAVENNA">Chiavenna</span> to <span class="placeName-COMO">Como</span> extended from Saturday to Monday, 15–17 June, with Monday devoted to excursions 
                    from the familyʼs base in <span class="placeName-CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</span>, as explained in the following gloss. The sunrise‐to‐sunset frame of the poem is also geographical, spanning the eastern leg to the western leg of the lake. 
                    <span class="persName-MWS">Mary Shelley</span> uses the same trope in a striking paragraph of <a href="/notes/bibliography#SHELLEYRAMBLES" target="_self"><span class="persName-MWS">Shelley</span>, <span class="title-book-SHELLEYRAMBLES"><i>Rambles in Germany and Italy</i></span></a>, 
                    describing the “progress of each day” she spent in <span class="placeName-CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</span> (1:67–68).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">In nineteenth‐century British travel guides, as now, the eastern leg of <span class="geogName-LAKECOMO">Lake Como</span> is often called <span class="geogName-LAKELECCO">Lake Lecco</span>. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs phrase, “<span class="geogName-MOUNTRESEGONE">Lecco mountains</span>”, however, is poetic; the mountain that rises above <span class="placeName-LECCO">Lecco</span> 
                        is <span class="geogName-MONTERESEGONE">Monte Resegone</span>, “distinguished by the saw‐like form of its crest against the sky”, as implied in its name
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MURRAYSHANDBOOKNORTHERNITALY1847" target="_self"><span class="title-book-MURRAYSHANDBOOKNORTHERNITALY1847"><span class="persName-GBM">Maule</span>, <i>Hand‐book for Travellers in Northern Italy</i></span></a>, 150). 
                        According to the <a href="/witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii#ACCOUNTTOCCADENABBIAILLUS" target="_self"><span class="title-bibliography_text-">List of Proposed Additional Contents for the “Account”—Illustrations</span></a>, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> planned to copy an illustration from <span class="persName-WBI">William Brockedon</span>ʼs <a href="/notes/bibliography#BROCKEDONILLUSTRATIONS" target="_self"><span class="title-book-BROCKEDONILLUSTRATIONS"><i>Illustrations of the Passes of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span></i></span></a> 
                        for this section, <span class="title-composite-JRCADENABBIACOMP">“<span class="placeName-CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</span>“</span>, which would show 
                        <span class="geogName-MOUNTRESEGONE">Resegone</span> rising above <span class="placeName-LECCO">Lecco</span>. The mountain is visible as one sails down the lake toward <span class="placeName-BELLAGIO">Bellagio</span>, before turning toward the western bank; and it can be seen even from <span class="placeName-CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</span> on the western bank, 
                        rising above the promontory of <span class="placeName-BELLAGIO">Bellagio</span>, as <span class="persName-MWS">Mary Shelley</span> remarked, its crest calling to her mind scenes from <span class="persName-AMANZONI">Manzoni</span>ʼs <span class="title-book-MANZONIPROMESSISPOSI"><i>I Promessi Sposi</i></span> (<span class="date-1827">1827</span>)

                        A path led to the summit above the village, “command[ing] the <span class="geogName-LAKELECCO">Lecco‐branch</span>, widely sweeping beyond the promontory of <span class="placeName-BELLAGIO">Bellagio</span>, 
                        and the glorious sight of the high <span class="geogName-GRISONS">Alps of the Grisons</span> and the <span class="geogName-VALTELLINA">Valtellina</span> displaying from afar 
                        their granite peaks and glacier summits” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MAZZONIMILAN" target="_self"><span class="persName-MMAZZONI">Mazzoni</span>, <span class="title-book-MAZZONIMILAN"><i>The Travellerʼs Guide of Milan</i></span></a>, 115). 
                        The Ruskins would also have been able to look back on this region by sighting the crest of <span class="geogName-MOUNTRESEGONE">Resegone</span> from atop <span class="name--DUOMOMILAN">Milan Cathedral</span> (see 
                        <a href="/witnesses/milan_cathedral_poem_msviii" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRMILANCATHEDRAL">“Milan Cathedral”</span></a> and its contextual glosses).</div>
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> does not describe the village of <span class="placeName-CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</span> itself in the poem. He probably found too little excitment in its most attractive feature, which since the eighteenth century had consisted in 
                        accommodations outside of the larger cities that English travelers could consider as “clean as in <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>”, its people “civil and <i>honest</i>”, and cookery worthy of a diplomat. 
                        “Did you think there existed such a place in <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>?” So wrote the well‐traveled bear‐leader <span class="persName-TBRAND">Thomas Brand</span> ([<span class="date-1751-1814">1751–1814</span>], quoted from a <span class="date-1791">1791</span> letter, in <a href="/notes/bibliography#BLACKITALY" target="_self"><span class="persName-JBLACK">Black</span>, <span class="title-book-BLACKITALY"><i>Italy and the Grand Tour</i></span></a>, 69). 
                        A more nuanced study of the village and its hotel life was written by <span class="persName-MWS">Mary Shelley</span> during her long stay in <span class="date-1840">1840</span>, an account attuned to the daily life of the people, ordinary objects, and peace of the surroundings.</div></span><br><br>

               <div class="p"><b>“Away, away, across the lake / . . . / The rock was high, the cavern dark / Scarce lit up by the jewelled spark, / Of the cold stream, that under earth / 
                    Was darkling buried at its birth. / . . . / We launched again, and downward bore / Awhile beside the centre shore. / Then left the shadowy eastern lake” 
                    (<span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>; <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i></span> [<span class="date-1891">1891</span>]; 
                    <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span> [<span class="date-1903">1903</span>])—</b>The latter three lines in this passage confirm that, from line 15 (“Away, away, across the lake”), 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> is referring to an excursion that the family made to the eastern shores of the lake on Monday, 17 June, after spending Saturday night and Sunday at <span class="placeName-CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</span>; 
                    then, as poem explains in conclusion, the family “launched” back across the lake to their hotel, and rowed south to <span class="placeName-COMO">Como</span>, taking in even more sights along the way. The sight on the opposite shore that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                    describes most particularly in the poem can be identified in <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span>ʼs diary account as the “torrent” <span class="geogName-FIUMELATTE">Fiumelatte</span>, 
                    which cascades into the lake below <span class="placeName-VARENNA">Varenna</span>, on the <span class="placeName-LECCO">Lecco</span> side of the lake (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFT48" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</span></a>, 43). 
                    This is the “cold stream” that issues “darkling” from a subterranean source, in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs lines. <span class="persName-JCEDITOR">Josiah Conder</span> (<span class="date-1789-1855">1789–1855</span>), 
                    the writer and compiler of the <span class="title-series-CONDERMODERNTRAVELLER">“Modern Traveller”</span> series of travel accounts, highlights this cascade in the seriesʼ <span class="date-1831">1831</span> volume on <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>: 
                    “The <i>Fiume di Latte</i> (so called from the milky colour of the water) is one of the wonders of the lake, being an intermittent stream, and, according to some Italian antiquaries, 
                    the one which <span class="persName-PLINYYOUNGER">the younger Pliny</span> refers to as being in the neighbourhood of his residence. . . . The <span class="geogName-">Fiume di Latte</span> intermits wholly during the winter, 
                    running only from March to September. It increases by degrees till it reaches its utmost height, and then decreases again till its bed again becomes dry. 
                    There seems to be no reason to doubt that its semi‐annual course is occasioned by the melting of the snows in the higher mountains, though the length of the subterranean channel through which it flows is unknown. 
                    Its excessive coldness is in favour of the supposition, that it is fed by some distant glacier; and its milky colour indicates that it has found or forced a channel through some limestone or calcareous formation. 
                    It bursts forth with great impetuosity from its subterranean channel, tumbling down a broken declivity of nearly a thousand feet into the lake” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#CONDERITALY" target="_self"><span class="persName-JCEDITOR">Conder</span>, <span class="title-book-CONDERITALY"><i>Italy</i></span></a>, 1:332–33). 
                    Mary Shelley could hear the “hollow roar of the mysterious torrent . . . borne, softened by distance, from the opposite shore”, when seated in the calm of evening at the lakeside in <span class="placeName-CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</span> 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#SHELLEYRAMBLES" target="_self"><span class="persName-MWS">Shelley</span>, <span class="title-book-SHELLEYRAMBLES"><i>Rambles in Germany and Italy</i></span></a>, 1:93).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-JCEDITOR">Conder</span> disputes the association of the <span class="geogName-FIUMELATTE">Fiumelatte</span> with <span class="persName-PLINYYOUNGER">Pliny</span>; and the Ruskins likewise looked elsewhere for this classical location; see 
                        <a href="/witnesses/villa_pliniana_poem_msviii" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRVILLAPLINIANA">“Villa Pliniana”</span></a> and its contextual notes.
                        Also in connection with the <span class="geogName-FIUMELATTE">Fiumelatte</span>, <span class="persName-JCEDITOR">Conder</span> quotes from the popular travel account of the Continent, <span class="title-book-MATTHEWSDIARYINVALID"><i>Diary of an Invalid</i></span> (<span class="date-1820">1820</span>), by 
                        <span class="persName-HMATTHEWS">Henry Matthews</span> (<span class="date-1789-1828">1789–1828</span>). Relevant to the trope of describing the expanse of the lake, <span class="persName-HMATTHEWS">Matthews</span> orients the traveler to the waterfall as a checkpoint, 
                        when sitting in a boat on the lake. Oppposite this “romantic little waterfall”, he writes, “there is a spot . . . from which you command a prospect of the whole scene”. 
                        Without having to climb to “a birdʼs‐eye view”, which <span class="persName-HMATTHEWS">Matthews</span> regards as a “disadvantage”, one has “the three branches of the lake under your eye at once”
