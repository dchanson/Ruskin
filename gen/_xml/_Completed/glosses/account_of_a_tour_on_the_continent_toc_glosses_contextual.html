                    The city was important as a banking and mercantile center, with a large Jewish population
                    including such prosperous families as the Rothschilds. Ministers from <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Great Britain</span> and <span class="placeName-EUROPE">Europe</span> were stationed here; accordingly, in his guidebook,

                        Opened in <span class="date-1828">1828</span> along with the adjacent Jewish cemetery, the <span class="placeName-building-FRANKFURTNEWCEMETERY">New Cemetery</span> presented an example of the public cemetery that was starting to replace church and churchyard burial,

                        that “deserve[d] to be abolished” especially in “large and densely inhabited cities”.

                        the English artist <span class="persName-JML">James Mathews Leigh</span> (<span class="date-1808-1860">1808–60</span>) 
                        noted, like <span class="persName-JCL">Loudon</span>, the neoclassicism of the architecture,
                        while also enjoying propects influenced by the picturesque tradition.
                        The structures were designed by the neoclassical architect, <span class="persName-FRUMPF">Friedrich Rumpf</span> (<span class="date-1795-1867">1795–1867</span>),
                        and the grounds were laid out in English garden style by <span class="persName-SRINZ">Sebastian Rinz</span> (<span class="date-1782-1861">1782–1861</span>).
                        A Doric propylaeum formed the entrance, which doubled as apartments for burial preparations “undertaken by a Company at small cost”, indicating the new commercial cemetery operations
                        that were displacing parish church control; and the burial plots were housed both in a necropolis‐style “simple colonnade . . . divided into fifty‐five compartments”,
                        “each . . . devoted to a family vault”, and in grander, “handsome mausoleum[s]” that stood apart from the colonnade. <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span>, with her usual British pride,
                        considered the <span class="placeName-FRANKFURT">Frankfurt</span> cemetery inferior to one in <span class="placeName-LIVERPOOL">Liverpool</span>,
                        likely referring to <span class="placeName-building-STJAMESSCEMETERY">St. Jamesʼs Cemetery</span>, opened in <span class="date-1829">1829</span> as a pioneering British alternative to overcrowded urban churchyards.
                        Designed by <span class="persName-JFOSTERA">John Foster</span> (<span class="date-1787-1846">1787–1846</span>), this site likewise featured severe neoclassicism in the form of a Doric temple,
                        the <span class="placeName-building-LIVERPOOLORATORY">Oratory</span>. Thus, contemporary cemetery architecture and sepulchral monuments presented <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>
                        with one notable experience of modern neoclassicism; see also

                    She then describes their intrepid descent into the gorge, again borrowing on the following account in <span class="persName-JGE">Ebel</span>:</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="floating-text">

                        <div class="p">The most lively imagination could not describe the entrance of <span class="placeName-TARTARUS">Tartarus</span>, under so hideous a form as that which nature has displayed in framing the defile of the <span class="geogName-TAMINAG">Tamina</span>.
                                    You enter it over a bridge composed of planks that rest on wedges beat into the rocks. This bridge is 6 or 700 paces long, which requires above a quarter of an hour
                                    to get over, as you must proceed with great caution. It is suspended over the <span class="geogName-TAMINAG">Tamina</span>, which is heard to roll furiously beneath it thirty or forty feet deep.
                                    Near to the bridge the defile is thirty feet wide, but lower down it straitens as it descends along the torrent. The lateral walls, cleft and torn in divers ways,
                                    rise 200 feet high, bend towards each other in the shape of a dome, and are 290 feet in height at that part where they entirely join. The faint light which illumines
                                    the entrance of the defile disappears in proportion as you proceed; and the damp cold that prevails increases the horror of the place. Sometimes the rocks
                                    that overhang the bridge are so close, that they will not allow one to stand up; and at another time they are so distant from it, that they no longer serve as a support.
                                    The bridge is narrow, often very slippery, and it will sometimes occur that one single plank stands between the traveller and the dark abyss of the <span class="geogName-TAMINAG">Tamina</span>. . . .
                                    The best method of avoiding danger is to walk between two men, each of them holding the extremities of a pole on the side of the precipice, which will serve as a support
                                    and a railing to the tourist. The spring is situated beyond the bridge. . . . I shall invite all such people, who are unwilling to expose themselves to the danger
                                    of going as far as the spring, to advance at least fifty paces on the bridge, beyond the entrance of the defile, and to sit down there to view at leisure the terrific prospect
                                    of that dreadful passage.</div>

                    <span class="title-opera-ROSSINIBARBER"><i>The Barber of Seville</i></span>, a work they enjoyed more than once during the tour.

                    and the traveller is surprised to find his carriage suddenly driven in perfect safety underneath a considerable waterfall”.

                    holding “some repute among tourists” for its waterfall, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> indeed lists first among his proposed illustrations for the section (Table 2). 
                    According to <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span>, a twenty‐minute walk behind the main inn brought the traveler to a cascade, of which the “volume of water is considerable”,

                        however, nothing in his proposed illustrations suggests the city. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs apparent avoidance of mentioning the place may have resulted from the familyʼs perception of it as “dirty and desolate looking,

                    “very fine, high rocks, with <span class="name--PINE">pine</span> forests and cottages and cultivated ground almost to the top”. The valley is drained by the <span class="geogName-DRANSEDENTREMONT">Dranse dʼEntremont</span>, 
                    a tributary of the <span class="geogName-DRANSERIVER">Dranse</span>, which the Ruskins skirted on their four‐and‐a‐half‐hour ride from <span class="placeName-MARTIGNY">Martigny</span>. They 
                    paused in the village of <span class="placeName-LIDDES">Liddes</span>, where they found other tourists preparing to continue the ascent. While the Ruskins dined, their mules were unhitched

                    Beyond the village, the path rose high above the river, the incline becoming “more rapid and the road narrower and more stony”, 
                    and the <span class="name--PINE">pines</span> and <span class="name--LARCH">larches</span> giving way to “bare rocks”. Even here, the Ruskins observed “cultivation” of land and “great quantities of the beautiful <span class="name--ALPINEROSE">Alpine rose</span>”. 
                    But now in view the highest peak, <span class="geogName-MONTVELAN">Mont Vélan</span>, and its glaciers, the Ruskins had entered on the most rugged stage of the climb through the forest of <span class="placeName-BOURGSAINTPIERRE">Saint Pierre</span> and,

                    At this height, as <span class="persName-WBI">Brockedon</span> along with other guidebook writers remarks, “the brethren of the convent” had established both a refuge and a charnel house,

                        when falling from his mule, and had to be rescued by a peasant—an inglorious reality, compared to the impression of this expedition conveyed by the equestrian portrait, <span class="title-artwork-DAVIDNAPOLEONCROSSINGALPS"><i>Napoleon Crossing the Alps</i></span> (<span class="date-1803">1803</span>),

                        “Such is the scene presented to the traveller at the <i><span class="placeName-building-SAINTMAURICEBRIDGE">Bridge of St. Maurice</span></i>,
                        which spans the rapid river with one bold arch, 70 ft. wide, leaning for support (appuyé) on the rt. side upon the <span class="geogName-DENTDEMORCLES">Dent de Morcles</span> [i.e., the western end of the <span class="geogName-BERNESEALPS">Bernese Alps</span>] 
                        and on the l. upon the <span class="geogName-DENTSDUMIDI">Dent de Midi</span> [i.e., <span class="geogName-DENTSDUMIDI">Dents du Midi</span>],
                        whose bases are pushed so far forward as barely to leave room for the river. The <span class="placeName-building-SAINTMAURICEBRIDGE">bridge</span>, erroneously attributed to the Romans,
                        is not older than the <span class="date-1400-1499">15th century</span>, but may possibly rest on Roman foundations. It unites the <span class="placeName-CANTONVAUD">canton Vaud</span> [to the west, above <span class="geogName-LAKEGENEVA">Lake Geneva</span>] 
                        with the <span class="placeName-CANTONVALAIS">canton Vallais</span> [to the east]; and a gate at one end, now removed, formerly served to close the passage up and down:
                        a circumstance alluded to in the lines of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>. A small fort was erected by the Swiss in <span class="date-1832">1832</span>, above the road,
                        to defend the pass”
