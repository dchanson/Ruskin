                    Starting in the <span class="date-1590-1599">1590s</span>, to evade persecution, English Catholics sent their children to be educated at this Jesuit school. 
                    The school was closed by the <span class="title-law-"><i>arrêt</i></span> of the Paris Parlement of <span class="date-1762">1762</span>, the decree aimed at the expulsion 
                    of Jesuits. The scholars migrated first to <span class="placeName-BRUGES">Bruges</span>, and then to <span class="placeName-LIEGE">Liège</span>. 
                    The Liège Academy was disrupted by the <span class="date-1799-11-09-1815-06-18">Napoleonic Wars</span>, and the scholars again migrated in <span class="date-1794">1794</span> to 
                    Stonyhurst in <span class="placeName-LANCASHIRE">Lancashire</span>, an estate donated by a former pupil as a permanent home for the school

                    For the Protestant Ruskins, the former site of the school at <span class="placeName-STOMER">Saint‐Omer</span> may 
                    have borne a melodramatic association with the <span class="date-1605">Gunpowder Plot</span>, in which some of its scholars were alleged to have participated—the only information about the school mentioned by

                        and she reports statistics about the view similar to <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span>ʼs: “we had a most beautiful

                    a celebration of Ascension Day: “we saw a procession pass which consisted of many images of the <span class="persName-scriptural-VIRGINMARY">Virgin</span> and <span class="persName-scriptural-JESUSCHRIST">Saviour</span>, supported and followed by most of the town people”,
                    the procession starting “from the church” and winding “all round the town to the church again. Just before it passed many people came out of houses carrying large bundles of grass (dʼherbes) 
                    which they strewed on the road for the procession to walk on”. The family watched the spectacle from inside the hotel, 
                    <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> admitting that the procession was the “first thing of the kind I had ever seen”. 
                    Emerging after the procession had passed, they found the “people on their knees” and “muttering prayers which we neither understood nor heard”

                  <div class="p">In <span class="date-1833">1833</span>, Ascension Day did indeed fall on <span class="date-1833-05-16">May 16</span>; however, some details in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, along with his drawing, 
                     suggest that he may have conflated the <span class="placeName-CASSEL">Cassel</span> celebration with a procession of Corpus Christi (or copied an illustration from a printed source),
                        which is held sixty days after Easter (<span class="date-1833-06-06">June 6 in 1833</span>) to commemorate the real presence of <span class="persName-scriptural-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span> in the Eucharist.
                    The canopy, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> mentions in his poem and shows in his tailpiece drawing, shelters the sacrament carried in a monstrance by a priest and his attendants. 
                    In <span class="date-1833">1833</span>, <span class="persName-FMT">Frances Trollope</span> described such a procession in <span class="placeName-OSTEND">Ostend</span>: 
                    “I rejoiced to find myself, on the <span class="date-1833-06-09">9th of June</span>, in so very Catholic a country; 
                    for the ceremonies by which the <i>Fête‐Dieu</i> was celebrated 
                    were really splendid, considering the size of the town. The streets were lined with double rows of young straight‐grown fir‐trees; 
                    every house being charged with the expense of purchasing such, and having them stuck in for the occasion. 
                    In the open places of the city, groups of these same slender trees supported wreaths and garlands of flowers, 
                    under which the host was carried in a splendid ark. The Curé, who bore this in his hands, 
                    was himself superbly dressed; and at each corner of the canopy, borne above his head, walked a child of four or five years old, 
                    in fancy costume, that looked as if it had been arranged by a ballet‐master. 
                    Three of them had wings; and the fourth, dressed as an infant <span class="persName-STJOHN">St. John</span>, would have been a beautiful model for a painter. 
                    The procession consisted of all the military in the garrison, a numerous cortège of priests, 
                    with their attendants, and the various associated companies of the town. 
                    But by far the prettiest part of the spectacle consisted of the double row of little girls, elegantly dressed in white, 
                    their heads adorned with wreaths of roses, and long white veils. Above two hundred of these pretty creatures, 
                    looking all smiles and gladness, followed the host; and when the procession paused, 
                    while the awful symbol was laid on the altar of the different <i>reposoirs</i> prepared to receive it, 
                    they, as well as the assembled multitude who followed them, prostrated themselves upon the ground before it. 
                    The children all visited the Curé in his sacristy as soon as the ceremony was over, 
                    and each received from him a little <i>cornet</i> of <i>bonbons</i>”
