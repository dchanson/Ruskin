                    <a href="/apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_apparatus" target="_self">“Harry and Lucy,” Vol. 2</a>, he wrote, “Red book No. 2. <span class="date-1870-09-08">Sept 8<sup>th</sup> 1870</span>”
                    (see <a href="/apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_apparatus#TITLE" target="_self">“Harry and Lucy,” Vol. 2: Title</a>). On the same day, he docketed 
                    <a href="/apparatuses/msiv_apparatus" target="_self">MS IV</a> as “Red book No. 1,” and <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self">MS I</a> as “Red
                    book No. 3.” For the meaning of this numbering, see <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self">Red Books</a>.</div>

                    title—intended originally, it appears, for MS III in its entirety as well as for its main work—is
                    “<span class="caps">Harry and Lucy / Concluded / Being / the Last Part / of / Early Lessons / in / Four Vols / Vol 2 / with Copper Plates / Hernhill</span>”
                    (see <a href="/apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_apparatus#TITLE" target="_self">“Harry and Lucy,” Vol. 2: Title</a>). This title page, like that for 
                    <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self">MS I</a> and its main work, <a href="/apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_apparatus" target="_self">“Harry and Lucy,” Vol. 1</a>,
                    fails to take account of a poetry anthology, <a href="/apparatuses/poetry_discriptive_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“poetry discriptive”</span></a>, situated
                    toward the end of the manuscript. Despite the omission, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> probably compiled the anthology at about the same time he was
                    inscribing the manuscriptʼs main work, “Harry and Lucy,” Vol. 2. Presumably, he wanted the manuscriptʼs contents to complement those
                    of MS I. Despite this original intention, the contents of MS III over time grew much more miscellaneous than the title page indicated, or that had been
                    the case in MS I.</div>

                        visit to <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span> and <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>. He appears originally
                        to have reserved three‐quarters of the notebook for “Harry and Lucy,” since later pages (pp. 36, 42) retain the
                        penciled indications, “chap 6” and “chap 7.” The narrative never extended that far, instead ending on p. 21
                        with the unfulfilled promise, “But I will put them [Harry and Lucy] on to scarthing moor in another chapter.” He may also
                        have intended the drawings on pp. , 34, 37, and 43 to accompany the projected narrative (see

                        he continued the poem in blank pages that remained just preceding <span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“poetry discriptive”</span>. He even made this clear by instructing the reader, in a colophon at the end
                        of book 2 of the poem on p. 80, to “go back to page 52 / <span class="smallcaps">End of Book Second</span> / <span class="smallcaps">Hern Hill</span> / <span class="smallcaps">Dulwich</span>.”</div>
