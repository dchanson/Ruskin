                        In what appears meant as a title, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> writes 
                        “heights of Wisdom / Depth of Fools” at the top of his drawing. He then repeats the phrase, 
                        “heights of wisdom” down the ravine between narrowing mountain heights until the word “last” declares the bottom. 
                        Below that are found “depths of folly” and “rivulet of vice”.

                     <div class="p">The emblematic drawing was perhaps inspired by a passage in <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span> (<span class="date-1825">1825</span>) by <span class="persName-ME">Maria Edgeworth</span>: 
                            Only “those who are themselves children, or . . . those who know children right well” will credit 
                            <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-LUCYME">Lucy</span>ʼs “sudden falls from the heights of wisdom to the depths of folly”. The protagonists 
                            have been engaged in well‐regulated learning: <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span> has been teaching <span class="persName-fictional-LUCYME">Lucy</span> the mechanics of air pumps, 
                            using a pump made of glass in order to exhibit its inner workings. “How did <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-LUCYME">Lucy</span> spend 
                            the remainder of this morning, two whole hours?” the narrator asks. They spoil the glass pump by 
                            setting it to work in a muddy puddle, and they soil their clothing so badly that they are forced 
                            to hide in a tree to avoid their <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMAME">mother</span>ʼs summons to greet unexpected visitors. To their consternation, 
                            their shame and bashfulness cost them an interesting account of a shipwreck, which the visitors related. 
                            <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-LUCYME">Lucy</span> beg their <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMAME">mother</span> to repeat the story, but she refuses lest they lose this motivation to overcome 
                            their follies of bashfulness and carelessness with their things.

                     <div class="p">Assuming that the source is correctly identified, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> can be seen translating an example of Edgeworthian experiential learning 
                            into the kind of didactic discourse that the Edgeworths opposed—teaching a child by lecture or emblem instead of allowing children to arrive at wisdom for themselves 
                            through their own experience. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs emblematic picture dispenses with narrative details—experience—in order to distill a pictorial contrast of “heights of wisdom” and 
                            “depths of folly”. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs edition of <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span> was not illustrated (see 
                            <a href="/notes/boyhood_books_note#DESCRIPTIONS" target="_self">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Physical Descriptions</a>), 
                            and the Edgeworths would not have approved of illustration in the form of allegory. In other books owned by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, however, 
                            emblems were familiar, such as <span class="title-anthology-SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALES"><i>Christmas Tales</i></span> by 
                            <span class="persName-fictional-SOBERSIDES">Solomon Sobersides</span>. Its frontispiece represents Wisdom and Folly competing to lead the steps of youth, 
                            as explained by an accompanying text: “See here the Youth, by Wisdom led, / The Paths of Life, securely tread; / The dangʼrous Lures of Folly shun, / 
                            And Virtueʼs Course serenely run.”</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">The emblems in this woodcut are unpacked in an essay introducing the copy of 
                            <span class="title-anthology-SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALES"><i>Christmas Tales</i></span> held by the Hockliffe Collection: 
                            “A masterpiece of its kind”, the engraving shows “Wisdom (looking rather like Britannia) giving a book to a young boy, 
                            while Folly (distinguished by her foolʼs hat) tries to distract him with a rattle. Behind them, we see the solid and magnificent temple 
                            built by Wisdom, and the ruined temple which must be the result of heeding the ‘Lures of Folly’”

                            The emblems in the frontispiece are derived from traditional sources, such as those found in <span class="persName-CRIPA">Cesare Ripa</span>ʼs <span class="title-book-RIPAICONOLOGIA"><i>Iconologia</i></span>, 
                            but they have been adapted to a childʼs text. The youth is put in the place of the classical hero, <span class="persName-fictional-HERCULES">Hercules</span>, 
                            who according to a parable must choose between virtue and vice. An example of an adaptation in neoclassical art is 
                            <span class="title-artwork-BATONIHERCULES"><i>Hercules at the Crossroads</i></span> (<span class="date-1748">1748</span>) 
                            by <span class="persName-PGBATONI">Pompeo Girolamo Batoni</span>, in which <span class="persName-fictional-HERCULES">Hercules</span> weighs the alternatives offered on the one hand by <span class="persName-fictional-VENUS">Venus</span> and on the other 
                            by the armored figure of <span class="persName-fictional-MINERVA">Minerva</span>, who points to the <span class="placeName-fictional-TEMPLEOFFAME">Temple of Fame</span> on a hill. In one of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs favorite boyhood books, 
                            <span class="title-lesson-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span>, he would have encountered a version adapted for girls, 
                            <span class="title-story-BARBAULDFEMALECHOICE">“The Female Choice: A Tale”</span> in which the heroine is divided 
                            between the appeals of Dissipation and Housewifery 
                            (<a href="/notes/bibliography#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS" target="_self"><span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span> and <span class="persName-JAIKIN">Aikin</span>, <span class="title-lesson-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span></a>, 3:160–65).
