                     <div class="p">While today the preferred spelling of the name of this castle and village in <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span> is 
                        <i><span class="placeName-RAGLAN">Raglan</span></i> or the Welsh <i><span class="placeName-RAGLAN">Rhaglan</span></i>, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs spelling, <i><span class="placeName-RAGLAN">Ragland</span></i>, 
                        would have seemed correct to nineteenth‐century English tourists. 
                        For example, the spelling <i><span class="placeName-RAGLAN">Ragland</span></i> appears in two important maps of the period: 
                        the <span class="title-map-GREENWOODMAPMONMOUTH-italic">Map of the County of Monmouth, from an Actual Survey Made in the Years 1829 & 1830</span> 
                        (<span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, <span class="date-1831">1831</span>) by the Greenwood brothers,

                        and the <span class="title-map-ORDINANCESURVEYMAPS-italic">Ordinance Survey “Old Series”</span> maps (sheet 43 [<span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, <span class="date-1831">1831</span>]). 
                        In tourism literature, the spelling was used by the <span class="placeName-MONMOUTH">Monmouth</span> printer, <span class="persName-CHMONMOUTH">Charles Heath</span> (<span class="date-1761-1830">1761–1830</span>), 
                        in his <i><span class="title-guidebook-HEATHRAGLANDCASTLE">Historical and Descriptive Accounts of the Ancient and Present State of Ragland Castle</span></i> (<span class="date-1792">1792</span>), 
                        a publication that preceded <span class="persName-CHMONMOUTH">Heath</span>ʼs popular guidebook to <span class="placeName-building-TINTERN">Tintern Abbey</span>,

                        <span class="persName-CHMONMOUTH">Heath</span>ʼs guidebooks to these monuments lasted through many editions <span class="date-1790-1829">from the 1790s through the 1820s</span> 
                        (see “‘The Picture of the Mind’: Tintern and Vicinity through Images” and 
                        “‘Gleams of Past Existence’: Charles Heathʼs Guide to Tintern Abbey” in

                        In his guidebook to the castle, <span class="persName-CHMONMOUTH">Heath</span> traced the Welsh etymology of the name and remarked that, in the process of “Englishiz[ing]” the name,

                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 2:255–56 n. 1; and see

                        <span class="title-poem-">“Ragland Castle”</span> is earlier than the anthology containing it, 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/poetry_discriptive_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“Poetry Discriptive”</span></a>.</div>

                        believed that, because the hand for this poem is smaller than for that characterizing other poems in

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have added it later to the front of the anthology

                        The argument is not convincing, since no crowding of lines suggests a later insertion, and the hypothesis creates a new problem of explaining why the following poem, 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/lochleven_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-LOCHLEVENPOEM">“Lochleven”</span></a> would have begun so far down on the page. 
                        In fact, the size of the lettering varies even within this fair copy of <span class="title-poem-">“Ragland Castle”</span>, 
                        and its smallest printing is no smaller than for some other portions of <a href="/apparatuses/poetry_discriptive_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“Poetry Discriptive”</span></a>.</div>

                            of poems, tales, and lessons by <span class="persName-WCP">William Cowper</span>, <span class="persName-ALB">Anna Letitia Barbauld</span>, and 
                            <span class="persName-JAIKIN">John Aikin</span> in <a href="/apparatuses/the_needless_alarm_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-THENEEDLESSALARM">“The Needless Alarm”</span></a> 
                            (see especially, for that poem, <a href="/apparatuses/the_needless_alarm_apparatus#SOURCES" target="_self">Discussion: Sources</a>). 
                            Also, contextualizing both the poem and the anthology that the poem heads, <a href="/apparatuses/poetry_discriptive_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“Poetry Discriptive”</span></a>, 
                            is the tradition of picturesque travel, writing, and art. Comically, however, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs narrator reduces the elements of the 
                            picturesque to a mere catalogue of the castleʼs architectural features, while the most picturesque effect seems achieved by the mice, 
                            which patch their “falling dwellings” with vegetation contrasting pleasingly with the stone of the “spiral towers”.</div>
