                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> could not have modeled the idea of appending a poetry anthology to his <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">“Harry and Lucy”</span> volumes on

                            <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>ʼs origingals contain no such feature. Instead, he might have encountered poetry anthologies in numerous places. 
                            The most likely source was the <a href="/notes/evangelical_magazine_note" target="_self"><span class="title-periodical-EVANGELICALMAG"><i>Evangelical Magazine</i></span></a>, which <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> read regularly from <span class="date-1823">1823</span> and possibly earlier. 
                            From its founding in <span class="date-1793">1793</span>, each issue featured a brief collection of poems with a header similar to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs title for his anthology—the single word “Poetry”, 
                            which in the magazine is printed in letter‐spaced capitals. Especially compelling for these monthly anthologies as an inspiration is their inclusion of occasional poems 
                            such as <a href="/notes/new_years_poems" target="_self">New Yearʼs Poems</a> in the annual January issue, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> likewise composed annually as a present to his father. Unlike the majority of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poems, however, 
                            the poetry selected for anthologizing in the <span class="title-periodical-EVANGELICALMAG"><i>Evangelical Magazine</i></span> was almost exclusively religious.</div>

                            In the <span class="title-essay-">“Address to Mothers”</span> by <a href="/notes/edgeworth_richard_lovell_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-RLE">Richard Lovell Edgeworth</span></a>, 
                            which prefaces some editions of <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHEARLYLESSONS"><i>Early Lessons</i></span>, the writer insists on allowing even greater authority to the childʼs 
                            “little hand”—not just to sift at random and convey a reading, as in the case of the Fairborne child, but deliberately to select what reading is best “adapted to [its] age and understanding”. 
                            “Well educated children”, <span class="persName-RLE">Edgeworth</span> writes, “are . . . the best judges of what is fit for children”; and parents should “select what they find upon trial 
                            to be the best for their immediate purpose, and to lay aside the rest for another opportunity”. Whereas on the one hand the Edgeworths took care to arrange their books for children as a succession of 
                            age‐appropriate lessons pitched to the abilities of their readers—from the most accessible “early lessons” in <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHFRANK"><i>Frank: A Book for Boys</i></span> and 
                            <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYPT2"><i>Harry and Lucy</i></span>, to <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHROSAMOND"><i>Rosamond</i></span>, and finally to 
                                <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><i>Frank: A Sequel</i></span> and <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span>—on the other hand, 
                                the Edgeworths emphasized that “different parts of . . . [these books] are suited to the tastes of different children, as well as to children of different ages”

                        <div class="p">Judging by the evidence of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <a href="/apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-lesson-">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I”</span></a>, 
                            and the poetry anthology appended to it, he took advantage of both the graduated progression of the educationistsʼ books and the permission to range at will. 
                            For youngest children, the <span class="title-essay-">“Address to Mothers”</span> recommends works by 
                            <span class="persName-JAIKIN">Aikin</span> and <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>—first, 
                            <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>ʼs <span class="title-lesson-BARBAULDLESSONS"><i>Lessons for Children</i></span> and <span class="title-anthology-BARBAULDHYMNSINPROSE-italic">Hymns in Prose</span>, 
                            and then <span class="persName-JAIKIN">Aikin</span> and <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>ʼs <span class="title-lesson-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span>. 
                            While pesumably <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs exposure to works for the nursery predated his project

                            retains vestiges of that earliest reading. At the same time, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> ranged freely, often imitating texts beyond his years. 
                            Whereas the <span class="title-essay-">“Address to Mothers”</span> recommends acquainting young children with natural history, 
                            yet advises delaying books that “teach particular sciences, or distinct branches of knowledge”

                            in the <span class="title-anthology-MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">MS I Poetry Anthology</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> reverses 
                            this recommended order, by starting with the ambitious 
                            <a href="/apparatuses/the_steam_engine_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHESTEAMENGINE">“When furious up from mines the water pours” [“The Steam Engine”]</span></a>, 
                            an imitation of a poem by <a href="/notes/darwin_erasmus_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-ED">Erasmus Darwin</span> (<span class="date-1731-1802">1731–1802</span>)</a>.
