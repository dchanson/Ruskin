                     <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs own page numbering starts on the first verso, p. 1, which is the verso of the flyleaf. 
                        (A leaf originally following the flyleaf appears to have been pasted to the flyleaf, so that the original recto of this second leaf is not presently visible. 
                        This was likely the condition in which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> found the notebook since it is the recto of this pasted leaf that he numbered p. 1.) 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs unorthodox numbering of versos using odd numbers continues to p. 43. 
                        Then, although no pages appear to have been removed, p. 43 (a verso) is followed by p. 45 (the facing recto). 
                        A sign that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> attempted to correct the anomaly slightly earlier appears on the facing spread, pp. 39–40, 
                        where he scored the zero of the numeral 40 with either a slash or a numeral 1. 
                        On the following two‐page spread, however, he kept to his previous system, and numbered the verso as 41, and the recto as 42. 
                        Only on the next spread, p. 43 (verso) facing p. 45 (recto), does the numbering change to the conventional odd‐numbering of rectos.
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> carried the new numbering through p. 55 (with numbering appearing only on the rectos, pp. 51, 53, and 55, their facing versos left unnumbered).</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">With the cessation of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs numbering, thereafter another hand—almost

                        leaves in pencil on the rectos, starting with 56 and carrying through 72. 
                        What would be leaves 73–75 are left blank, and the same hand picks up again with 76–79. 
                        Again, a blank is left for 80, but 81 is written above “p. 106”—the latter notation surely the remnant of <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs 
                        effort to follow through with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs original page numbering system in order to deduce what he calls the “stratification” of the notebook 
                        (see <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">“Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems”</span>, in which he references “p. 106”

                        but began numbering again, accurately, with p. 40 (a verso) through p. 63 (a recto). 
                        Four more unnumbered pages of the play remain, followed by seven more leaves (the final leaf glued to the endpaper, like the first leaf at the other end).</div>

                        From <span class="date-1831-08-22-1831-09-21">August or September 1831</span> through no later than <span class="date-1833-05-10">10 May 1833</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> started entering draft in the first blank pages following the notebookʼs front flyleaf and worked forward, 
                        apparently with little deviation from sequential order. A major project sustained throughout this first portion of the notebookʼs stratification is the epic poem, 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/athens_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span></a>, 
                        which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drafted in stints of two to five stanzas, the stints appearing intermittently amid shorter poems. 
                        This procedure is consistent with how <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> worked in 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/msvi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span></a>, 
                        a rough‐draft notebook used from <span class="date-1830-09-1830-12">late 1830</span> through <span class="date-1831">1831</span>. 
                        In that earlier manuscript, too, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> alternated draft of the epic‐length travel poem, 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/the_iteriad_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">“The Iteriad”</span></a>, with composition of shorter poems. 
                        In fact, the two epic projects overlap briefly at the beginning of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, 
                        with a small portion of the fourth book of <a href="/apparatuses/the_iteriad_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">“The Iteriad”</span></a> 
                        situated immediately following the notebookʼs first stint of <a href="/apparatuses/athens_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span></a> stanzas

                        draft that presumably was originally followed by a hiatus in composition during the familyʼs summer

                        represents by far the greater amount of poetic activity, this period marked by the completion in draft and fair copy of one epic, 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/the_iteriad_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">“The Iteriad”</span></a>; 
                        the inception (albeit not completion) in draft and fair copy of another epic, 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/athens_apparatus#ATHENS" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span></a>; and the drafting of more than thirty shorter poems, 
                        many of which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> fair‐copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>. 
                        The poetry in this section returns repeatedly to the locale and imagery associated with <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span>,

                        is considerably briefer, containing no major poetic projects such as epics, and consisting of only about five shorter poems. 
                        The topographical orientation shifts from <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span> to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> and the <span class="placeName-LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</span>, 
                        and the Scottish associations are solemnized by the death of <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>, 
                        for whom <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrote an elegy. A demarcation of <a href="#LISTA2">list <i>a</i>.2</a> from 
                        <a href="#LISTA1">list <i>a</i>.1</a> is open to argument,

                        In <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, following <a href="/apparatuses/my_fathers_birthday_the_month_of_may_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRMONTHOFMAY">“My Fatherʼs Birthday: The Month of May”</span></a>, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> merely drew a horizontal line; and, below this, he composed

                        lines that have not been identified with a specific section of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>, 
                        but that seem “descriptive, probably, of the <span class="placeName-ALPS">Alps</span>”, as the editors of the 
                        <a href="/notes/library_edition_note" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span></a> suggest 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 2:384 n. 1). While no evidence definitively ties this brief lyric to the 
                        <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>, ample clues identify the following prose essay with the longer work. 
                        The title of the essay, <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">“The Source of the Arveron”</span></a>, was likely meant 
                        as a section heading for both the essay and the poem following it, <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus#JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY">“I woke to hear the lullaby”</span></a> 
                        (separately entitled <span class="title-poem-JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY">[“The Arve at Chamouni”]</span> by <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span>). 
                        Together, the essay and poem can be identified with a unit in the <a href="/witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii" target="_self"><span class="title-bibliography_text-JRROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan for Continuation of the Account of a Tour on the Continent</span></a>. 
                        Either immediately before or after <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus#JROHARETHERESPIRITS" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JROHARETHERESPIRITS">“Oh are there spirits, can there be”</span></a>, 
                        there would have occurred a gap in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs use of the notebook, during which the family was touring the Continent. It is unlikely that he carried 
                        <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> with him on the journey, since he began the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> in other manuscripts, 
                        turning to this rough‐draft notebook only after he was well along in both draft and fair copy, probably in about in <span class="date-1834-02">February 1834</span> (see 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus#DATE" target="_self"><span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</span>: Date</a>).</div>
                           
                           <div class="p">There are other clues, albeit of questionable reliability, indicating whether the prose and verse drafts in <a href="#SECTIONB">section <i>b</i></a> 
                        belong to the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>. First, the scope of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs page numbering, pp. 1–55, 
                        roughly comprises <a href="#SECTIONA">section <i>a</i></a> of the manuscript, with the final work in that section, 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/my_fathers_birthday_the_month_of_may_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRMONTHOFMAY">“My Fatherʼs Birthday: The Month of May</span>”</a>, 
                        concluding on p. 53. Only two more numbered pages extend beyond the implicit gap into the renewed use of the notebook for composition of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>. 
                        Second, beyond p. 55 <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> left section <i>b</i> unnumbered, suggesting that he regarded his earlier page numbering as unrelated to the new project. 
                        Instead, he started a new numbering system, associating the draft poems (not the prose) for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> with line numbers, 
                        which run continuously from poem to poem. He used the same system of continuous line numbering for the <a href="/apparatuses/msia_apparatus" target="_self">MS IA</a> witnesses of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>. 
                        The line numbers for the two sets of witnesses are compatible, with the <a href="/apparatuses/msia_apparatus" target="_self">MS IA</a> range of 1–429 fitting 
                        within the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> range starting with “520”, although the two ranges are separated by an unaccountable gap.</div>
                           
                           <div class="p">Although compatible, tne two sets of line numbers divided between the two groups of witnesses are crude and open to considerable speculation if one attempts to use the numbering to draw conclusions 
                            about the sequence of composition or the sequence of witnesses intended for fair copy. In <a href="/apparatuses/msia_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span></a>, 
                            the draft of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> consists of three separate sheets, on which the verse is line‐numbered 
                            respectively 1–51, 52–204, and 324–429. (The draft appears to be semi‐final fair copy, so the line numbering may have originated with earlier draft, now lost.) 
                            In the first two sheets, the witnesses are ordered in the same sequence in which the poems are arranged in the fair copy in <a href="/apparatuses/msix_apparatus" target="_self">MS IX</a>. 
                            In the third sheet of draft in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>, despite the continuous numbering, 324–429, the witnesses are not arranged in a sequence 
                            that would be maintained in fair copy, and clearly were not meant to be so. The same is true of the witnesses in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, 
                            in which the lines of poetry are numbered sequentially and continuously from poem to poem, although the sequence of composition bears little relation to the topographical sequence 
                            that the individual witnesses would occupy in the fair copy.</div>
                           
                           <div class="p">If crude, the line numbering in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> is somewhat helpful in discerning the scope of the draft for the 
                            <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>. The line numbering commences with the fifth line of 
                            <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus#JROHARETHERESPIRITS" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JROHARETHERESPIRITS">“Oh are there spirits, can there be”</span></a>, 
                            thus providing the most direct evidence that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intended this lyric for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>. 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> assigns the fifth line of the poem the number “510”, and the tenth line “515”. Four more lines take the poem 
                            to the bottom of the page (p. 53); and then the following page, a verso, plus a third of the following recto are taken up by the prose piece, 
                            <span class="title-essay-JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">“The Source of the Arveron”</span>, which carries no line numbers. The line numbering resumes with “520”, 
                            assigned to the next occurring poem, <span class="title-poem-JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY">“I woke to hear the lullaby”</span> (p. 55)—the 
                            sequence picking up correctly from line 519 at the bottom of p. 53. Despite this regularity at the start, toward the end of <a href="#SECTIONB">section <i>b</i></a> 
                            the continuous line numbering extends into works that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> certainly did not intended for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> 
                            (e.g., <a href="/apparatuses/the_crystal_hunter_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRCRYSTALHUNTER">“The Crystal Hunter”</span></a>), 
                            probably because he sometimes numbered the ruled lines of the notebook ahead of composition, and then neglected to erase the numbers when he departed from composition of the 
                            <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>. One might infer from this anomaly that the relation of the line numbering 
                            in <a href="#SECTIONB">section <i>b</i></a> to the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> is accidental, 
                            as if <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> were merely counting the number of lines of verse—any verse—composed per day. This probability is foiled, however, 
                            by the opposite anomaly, the abrupt cessation in line numbering for verse that seems unrelated to the surrounding topographical description of the journey (e.g., the mysterious fragment, 
                            <a href="/apparatuses/the_lake_smiled_sweetly" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHELAKESMILEDSWEETLY">“The lake smiled sweetly, and the boy”</span></a>.</div>
                           
                           <div class="p">As the surest and most valuable evidence afforded by the line numbering in <a href="#SECTIONB">section <i>b</i></a>, 
                            the sequence of verse and prose sections of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> 
                            can be compared as a reliable sequence of composition against the sequence of fair‐copying in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>. 
                            Sections that appear relatively early in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy—such as the prose sections for

                            which belong to the first stage of the work recounting the journey through northern <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span>, <span class="placeName-BELGIUM">Belgium</span>, 
                            and <span class="placeName-PRUSSIA">Prussia</span>—in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> occur as drafts intermixed with sections 
                            that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> destined for the later Italian and Swiss stages of the work (sections that, as it happened, he never got around to fair‐copying). 
                            Thus, the sequence of composition reflects the pace of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs fair‐copying in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>, 
                            as he was simultaneously composing prose and verse for the later portions of the work. This evidence allows for fairly precise reconstruction of the process and dating of composition 
                            (see <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus#DATEOFCOMPOSITION" target="_self"><span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</span>: Date of Composition</a> and

                           <div class="p">Thus, <a href="#SECTIONB">section <i>b</i></a> of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> contains significant,

                        The pattern shows that, in this section, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs activity was as homogeneous as it had been varied in <a href="#SECTIONA">section <i>a</i></a>. 
                        Not that he had become single‐minded in his pursuits. Throughout the first half of <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, while continuing composition of the 
                        <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, 
                        along with the workʼs fair‐copying and illustration in <a href="/apparatuses/msix_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span></a>, 
                        he continued his lessons with tutors, along with other kinds of writing—scientific, mathematical, and probably theological (see <a href="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</a>). 
                        Rather, <a href="#SECTIONB">section <i>b</i></a> suggests that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs pursuits had become 
                        more distinctly categorized and focused than formerly—focused both on a single literary work within this section of as <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, 
                        and divided into distinct disciplinary activity in other noteboooks. At the same time, the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> as a literary project 
                        is ekphrastic and multi‐genre, defined by a principle of mixed kinds, as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> elaborated what was originally a solely verse travelogue 
                        into a composite‐genre prose and verse, and illustrated travelogue. As such, the project reflects <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs awareness of the miscellaneity and 
                        burgeoning technologies in the print culture of travel literature in the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. His engagement with this print culture was rewarded by 
                        a commission in <span class="date-1834">1834</span> to revise a portion of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> for publication, 
                        as well as to compose a new topographical poem as an ekphrastic complement to an engraving—both poems published in

                        which he calculated as pp. 105–6 based on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs page numbering earlier in the notebook. (These pages still carry

                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> calculated that, by the time <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> reached this page,

                        Then at this point, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> says, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> skipped ahead in the manuscript to compose 
                        New Yearʼs and birthday odes for <span class="date-1835">1835</span>; he then returned to pp. 105–6, where he had left off drafting the 
                        <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>, in order to compose a poem connected with the

                        This is incorrect, as argued in <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus#COMPPUB" target="_self">Account of a Tour on the Continent: Composition and Publication</a>,

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not <i>return</i> to this place in the notebook after having jumped ahead; rather, he composed it

                        to the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>. A prose work immediately following the

                        Other works mixed among the later pieces drafted for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> are clearly purposed

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was working on the latter poem—the “Geological poem”, as he called it—at the time of a <a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1834-02-22_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-"><span class="date-1834-02-22">22 February 1834</span> letter</span></a> 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 280), but his composition of these works in

                        While his idea was prompted by a misreading of the date and occasion of <span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">“Saltzburg”</span>, the hand used on 82r

                        Upside‐down to the front of the notebook, and running reverso from the opposite end (and separated from the main text by blank leaves), 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composed a small group of poems (Contents, <a href="SECTIONC">section <i>c</i></a>)

                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs suggestion is unlikely, since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs writing for <span class="date-1834-12">December 1834</span> is already known

                        and that lacks a known New Yearʼs ode. Possible dates are 1 January <span class="date-1832-01-01">1832</span>, <span class="date-1833-01-01">1833</span>, <span class="date-1834-01-01">1834</span>,

                           <div class="p">We can reasonably conclude, then, that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> produced Contents, section <i><a href="SECTIONC">c</a></i> as a stint of writing distinct from what he was drafting elsewhere 
                        in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> at the time, but we cannot be certain whether that time was prior to New Yearʼs in <span class="date-1832-12-21-1832-03-20">winter 1832</span>, or prior to that holiday in <span class="date-1833-12-21-1833-03-20">winter 1833</span>. 
                        Oppositely, we can conclude with certainty that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> produced 
                        Contents, section <i><a href="SECTIOND">d</a></i> prior to <span class="date-1834-01-01">New Yearʼs in winter 1834</span>, but we cannot be confident that this section represents a distinct stint, produced at a different time 
                        from what immediately precedes it. If another distinct stint is represented by the 30 leaves between section <i><a href="SECTIOND">d</a></i>, starting on 112r, and the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> project that, 
                        along with the associated revision and composition for <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span>, left off at 82r in <span class="date-1834-06-21-1834-07-22">early summer 1834</span>, 
                        then we can conceive of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> returning to these available 30 leaves following the familyʼs second major Continental tour, 
                        the <a href="/notes/tour_of_1835_html" target="_self">Tour of 1835</a>, undertaken between <span class="date-1835-06">June</span> and <span class="date-1835-12">December</span>,
                        since much of the writing filling that space is at least thematically related to places the family visited. In <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs interpretation, this post‐tour writing of <span class="date-1835-09-1835-12">late 1835</span> and <span class="date-1836">1836</span> 
                        carries forward to <span class="date-1838">1838</span> with lyric poems dedicated to <span class="persName-ACD">Adèle Domecq</span>, before running up against the pre‐existing section <i><a href="SECTIOND">d</a></i> of <span class="date-1834-09-1834-12">late 1834</span>. 
                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> bases this surprising terminus ad quem on the date of <span class="date-1838">1838</span> he assigns to

                        In fact, the sequence of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs use of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> may be even more complicated after Contents, section <i><a href="SECTIOND">d</a></i>, and his use of the 30 blank leaves requires subdividing 
                        into Contents, section <i><a href="SECTIONE">e</a></i>, section <i><a href="SECTIONF">f</a></i>, and section <i><a href="SECTIONG">g</a></i>.
                    </div>
                           
                           <div class="p">In assessing <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs interpretation, one should bear in mind that the major metrical account of the <span class="date-1835">1835</span> tour, the 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/journal_of_a_tour_through_france_to_chamouni_1835_apparatus#JRJOURNALTOURFRANCE" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTOURFRANCE1835">“Journal of a Tour through France to Chamouni, 1835”</span></a>, 
                            does not appear to be represented in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>. 
                            In fact, no draft at all is known of the poem, its fair‐copy presentation alone surviving, in <a href="/apparatuses/msx_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSX">MS X</span></a>. 
                            Even in this form, this latest topographical poem proved less ambitious than the 1833–34 <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>, in that the <span class="title-poem-JRTOURFRANCE1835">“Journal”</span> is not a composite of verse and prose, 
                        and its fair copy lacks illustrations or an engraving‐like 
                        “copperplate” hand. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> apparently found sufficient ambition in imitating <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>ʼs 
                        Spenserian stanza from <span class="title-poem-BYRONPILGRIMAGE"><i>Childe Haroldʼs Pilgrimage</i></span>. 
                            What the initial use of the 30 leaves, section <i><a href="SECTIONE">e</a></i> of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, may represent, then, 
                        is the variety of genre that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> filtered out, as it were, 
                            from his major metrical poem for the <span class="date-1835">1835</span> tour, as compared with the elaborately composite, illustrated <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> produced in response to the <span class="date-1833">1833</span> tour.</div>
                           
                           <div class="p">As already cautioned, however, it is possible that, in filling the 30 leaves with a variety of genres—for example, a dramatic sketch, a tale—<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was pursuing the thrill 
                        of publishing in the gift annuals. He may have begun section <i><a href="SECTIONE">e</a></i>  
                        in the second half of <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, composing such works as

                        <a href="/apparatuses/leoni_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-story-JRLEONI">“Leoni”</span></a>, not owing to visits the family would pay to the <span class="placeName-building-STBERNARDHOSPICE">Hospice of St. Bernard</span> and <span class="placeName-VENICE">Venice</span> in <span class="date-1835">1835</span>, 
                        but because sketches and tales were germane to the literary annuals in which he had made his debut in <span class="date-1834">1834</span>–<span class="date-1835">35</span>.

                        and one did not need to experience <span class="placeName-VENICE">Venice</span> first‐hand to wield the popular literary imagining of its setting. Regarded in that light, 
                        one can imagine the stint of writing in section <i><a href="SECTIONE">e</a></i> flowing sequentially and chronologically into the <span class="date-1834-09-1834-12">late‐1834</span> section <i><a href="SECTIOND">d</a></i>;

                        may extend from <span class="date-1834-05-1834-08">mid‐1834</span> only until <span class="date-1835">1835</span>–<span class="date-1836">36</span>, and not as late as <span class="date-1838">1838</span>, as <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> believed.</div>

                        is continuous with the tour‐inspired shorter poems in section <i><a href="SECTIONE">e</a></i>.

                        <div class="p">Following the initial sequence, section <i>a</i>, which ends with the draft of his ode celebrating <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs <span class="date-1833-05-10">May 1833</span> birthday,
                            <a href="/apparatuses/my_fathers_birthday_the_month_of_may_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRMONTHOFMAY">“My Fatherʼs Birthday: The Month of May”</span></a>, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> devoted the next sequence in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> to the draft lyrics and prose passages that make up part of the topographical work, 
                            <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-composition-JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</span></a>. The work describes the Ruskin familyʼs 
                            <a href="/notes/tour_of_1833_note" target="_self">Tour of 1833</a>, on which they departed immediately following <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs <span class="date-1833-05-10">birthday</span>; however, there is no evidence 
                            that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> carried <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> with him on the tour, or that these entries represent impressions taken down en route. 
                            Rather, the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> drafts all but certainly represent a stage of the work that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> initiated earlier and elsewhere, 
                            one represented by sheets containing draft of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> that survive in <a href="/apparatuses/msia_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span></a> (although even these sheets may not necessarily date from the tour itself). 
                            The <a href="/apparatuses/msia_apparatus" target="_self">MS IA</a> sheets represent not only an earlier stage but also a somewhat different version of the work, conceptualized as exclusively verse rather than as a composite genre 
                            (see <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus#COMPPUB" target="_self"><span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent: Composition and Publication</span></a>). 
                            The <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft takes up in mid‐progress of the work; 
                            and as explained in the <a href="DESCRIPTION">Description</a>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> appears to declare the start of this new sequence in the notebook—not, unfortunately, with a title 
                            demarcating the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>—but with a system of line numbering, which starts at line 506, evidently assigned to the first line of the first poem of the project to be drafted in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>. 
                            Clearly, the line numbering shows a continuation from elsewhere—logically, from a system represented on the sheets in <a href="/apparatuses/msia_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span></a>.</div>
                        
                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> nowhere explicitly explains his purpose in numbering the lines, 
                            and he is inconsistent in its practice. Thus, while I interpret section <i>b</i> of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> as starting with the first poem to be marked with this line numbering, 
                            <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus#OHARETHERESPIRITS" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-OHARETHERESPIRITS">“Oh are there spirits, can there be”</span></a>, 
                            one cannot be certain that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intended this poem to form part of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>, since his intention respecting the line numbering is obscure in itself, 
                            and since the poemʼs content is not explicitly topographical, and no title declares the onset of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> project. 
                            Beyond this first lyric, the content of the entries do become clearly topographical, and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> entitles many of the sections of prose and poetry with place names 
                            related to the tour. At a certain point in section <i>b</i>, however, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            mixes the sequence of pieces for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> with writing from <span class="date-2011-03-20-1834-06-21">Spring 1834</span> 
                            that is identifiable with other purposes, such celebrating <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs birthday, and yet he does abandon the line numbering. Thus, the first portion of Contents, section <i>b</i>, 
                            which appears devoted exclusively to the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> is designated section <i>b.1</i>, while the stint that becomes more miscellaneous is designated 
                            section <i>b.2</i>

                                    Nothing definitively proves that, at this point of composition, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> identified these lines with the place name, <span class="placeName-GENOA">Genoa</span>, or destined these lines for a later, fuller composition of that name.

                                    The remainder of 66r is filled with two pen-and-ink sketches, <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus#JRMOUNTAINSKETCH" target="_self"><span class="title-artwork-JRMOUNTAINMSVIII">Mountain Sketch</span></a> and

                                    In the right margin, underneath the drawings, appear the figures 925 and 930, numbering that is continuous with 890–920 assigned to the poem preceding 
                                    <span class="title-essay-JRAIXLACHAPELLE">“Aix la Chapelle”</span>, 
                                    <span class="title-poem-JRLAGOMAGGIORE">“It was an eve of summer, mild”</span>. Evidently <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> prepared this space 
                                    for a stint of poetry, but distracted himself with the sketches instead. When he resumed drafing poetry on the verso (66v), <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                                    did not begin numbering from 921, where he left off at the end of <span class="title-poem-JRLAGOMAGGIORE">“It was an eve of summer, mild”</span>, 
                                    but from 939—as if he did use “925” and “930” to number verse lines on 66r. Perhaps he had already pre‐numbered the column on 66v, as well.
                                    Another curiosity respecting numbering is the figure 100, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> jotted parallel with the final line of 
                                    <span class="title-essay-JRAIXLACHAPELLE">“Aix la Chapelle”</span> (66r). Normally, no numbering is associated with prose at all.</li>

                                    (70v; poem, titled by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, lines numbered 1148–59; retitled by <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> as “Entrance to Schaffhausen”). 
                                    The final punctuation of this poem is a comma, indicating that this draft poem is likely incomplete. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs line numbering 
                                    for this draft is anomalous, the count of 1148–59 overlapping with that for the preceding poem, , 
                                    which runs 1083–1155. Toward the end of the latter draft, at the top of 70v, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> plainly wrote the numeral 1150 next to a line. That draft runs 5 more lines, 
                                    but <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not write 1155 next to the final line. Instead, he started <span class="title-poem-JRSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">“Schaffhausen”</span> and, 8 lines into that draft, 
                                    wrote the number 1155 next to a line that, if numbered sequentially with the preceding poem, should have been 1163. Also, counting 4 lines backdwards from that (mis)numbered line, 
                                    he tagged a line with the odd number 1151—a noticeable departure from his usual practice of numbering lines in intervals of 5. Since the manuscript gives every appearance of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                                    working steadily and sequentially, with no crowding of lines, the inconsistent numbering seems to reflect a deliberate attempt by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                                    to make an adjustment in his system, but it is unclear what effect he meant that adjustment to have, since an omission of 12 lines from his numbering does not appear to account for a previously noted anomaly—or 
                                    to do correctly, at any rate. As another possible clue to the mystery of this renumbering, following the line of <span class="title-poem-JRSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">“Schaffhausen”</span> that he numbered 1155, 
                                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrote at the end of the next line what may be “11” but scored through (making it look like a pound symbol #), 
                                    as if he started to write a line number but changed his mind.)</li>

                                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> omitted the poemʼs dozen lines from his system of line numbering, which jumps from 1159, at the end of the preceding poem, 
                                    <span class="title-poem-JRSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">“Schaffhausen”</span>, to 1160, at the start of the following section. There is no sign that the lines were 
                                    inserted in this place in the notebook at a later time; the manuscript shows no crowding or change in compositional proecedure, a line space neatly separating the lines 
                                    from the poem that precedes them, <span class="title-poem-JRSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">“Schaffhausen”</span>, and another line space separating the lines 
                                    from the poem that follows, <span class="title-poem-JRNOTSUCHTHENIGHT">“Not such the night whose stormy might” [“Evening at Chamouni”]</span>. As remarked in connection with

                                        With <span class="title-poem-">“The Vintage”</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> departed from composition of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> 
                                        to prepare birthday odes for his <span class="persName-JJR">father</span>ʼs <span class="date-1834-05-10">May 1834</span> celebration. There is no sign in the manuscript 
                                        that he intercalated this birthday poetry at a later time between draft for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>; 
                                        there are no signs of crowding, with <span class="title-poem-">“The Vintage”</span> beginning three‐quarters down the page on 72r, 
                                        followed by <span class="title-poem-JRCRYSTALHUNTER">“The Crystal Hunter”</span> halfway down 72v, and then <span class="title-poem-JRADDRESS">“The Address”</span> 
                                        halfway down 76r. Where draft definitely intended for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> resumes on 78v and 79r, 
                                        its positioning suggests only the ongoing flow of composition, with no breaks or interpolation. In fact, the problem lies in distinguishing the birthday poetry 
                                        from the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>, since this other poetry is so teasingly related thematically 
                                        to the tour poem that it can seem difficult to distinguish from the surrounding project. No ambiguity detracts from identifying <span class="title-poem-JRADDRESS">“The Address”</span> 
                                        as anything other than a birthday address; and its fair‐written presentation copy in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> is dated for his 
                                        <span class="persName-JJR">father</span>ʼs <span class="date-1834-05-10">May 1834</span> birthday, and paired with a fair copy of <span class="title-poem-JRCRYSTALHUNTER">“The Crystal Hunter”</span>, 
                                        proving the ultimate intention of that poem, as well. However, the subject of <span class="title-poem-JRCRYSTALHUNTER">“The Crystal Hunter”</span> 
                                        was surely suggested by the <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</span> crystal hunter, <span class="persName-JBM">Jacques Balmat</span>, whose heroism 
                                        in scaling the summit of <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span> is celebrated in <span class="title-poem-JRNOTSUCHTHENIGHT">“Not such the night whose stormy might” [“Evening at Chamouni”]</span>. 
                                        The two poems are even seamlessly connected by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs line numbering (see below). Similar ambiguity attaches to 
                                        <span class="title-poem-">“The Vintage”</span>, which is thematically related to the prose for the tour poem which immediately precedes it, 
                                        <span class="title-prose-JRMOSTBEAUTIFULPATHS">“Most beautiful are the paths” [“Heidelberg”, prose]</span>; and this case, no separate fair copy 
                                        indicates an independent use for the poem. The editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> evidently did not know what to make of the poem,

                                        Of the competing systems of line numbering attached to the poem, that starting at 1183 picks up from line 1182 that closes

                                        The alternate system starting with line 1 and numbering at intervals of 5 is abandoned after stanza 11 possibly because, after stanza 12, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> transposed stanzas.

                                        he omits copying, but intends to include, the intervening 22 lines between the repeated opening and closing lines of the former draft—that closing line forming

                                        which seems to correspond to four asterisks that follow this line in the earlier draft on 64v. Following these directions to incorporate the earlier poem 
                                        appear three more lines that are scored through (“And think how wide the world must be / Across from pole to pole / When all that there you look upon”), but here the strikethrough

                       that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> used for rough‐drafting poetry and imaginative prose. 
                       Usually shortly following composition here, or even simultaneously, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> fair‐copied many of these works in other notebooks. 
                       As analyzed in <a href="COLLATION">Description: Collation</a>, 
                       MS VIII exhibits a pattern similar to that of <a href="/apparatuses/msvi_apparatus" target="_self">MS VI</a>, 
                       whereby <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drafted a longer work in stints, 
                       compiling and fair‐copying the longer work elsewhere, 
                       while also varying the ongoing composition in the rough-draft notebook with brief lyrics between the stints of the epic. 
                       The principal long work developed in this fashion in <a href="/apparatuses/msvi_apparatus" target="_self">MS VI</a> is 
                       <a href="/apparatuses/iteriad_apparatus" target="_self">“The Iteriad”</a>, 
                       the composition of which spills over into the start of MS VIII; and the principal work taking the latterʼs place as the extended project in MS VIII is 
                       <a href="/apparatuses/athens_apparatus#JRCOMPPUB" target="_self">“Athens”</a>.
                   </div> 
                     
                     <div class="p">Ruskin fair‐copied both of these works in MS V and 
                       <a href="/apparatuses/msvii_apparatus" target="_self">MS VII</a>--the latter evidently intended as the showcase for complete fair copies of both poems, 
                       although Ruskin finished copying only <a href="/apparatuses/iteriad_apparatus" target="_self">“Iteriad”</a>, in January 1832, whereas he barely 
                       starting transcribing "Athens," before abandoning the project. MS V, which relates to MS VIII primarily as a place where Ruskin fair-copied the miscellaneous poems drafted between 
                       the stints of epic, became the vessel for his most extensive fair copy of the unfinished 
                       <a href="/apparatuses/athens_apparatus" target="_self">“Athens”</a>.
                   </div>

                        Although Ruskin appears not to have taken MS VIII with him 
                        on family tours, he used the manuscript to explore how to translate memories of landscapes into verse, 
                        referring both directly and obliquely to Welsh scenes he encountered during the 
                        <a href="/notes/tour_of_1831_note" target="_self">Tour of 1831</a>. 
                        Simultaneously, he was evoking memories of Wales in drawings for his master,

                        While he was perhaps a long way from a sophisticated idea of ekphrasis, his letters to his father suggest that he was developing 
                        some idea of “poetry & painting” as sister arts 
                        (<a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1832-02-27_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter of <span class="date-1832-02-27">27 February 1832</span></span></a> [<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 268]). 
                        For example, he composed <a href="/apparatuses/llyn_idwal_apparatus" target="_self">“Llyn Idwal”</a> as a recollection of Wales 
                        probably at about the same time that, according to letters of <a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1832-02-20_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">20 February</span></a> and <a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1832-02-27_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">27 February</span></a>, he “invent[ed] a scene” based on “models𡀝 provided by <a href="/notes/runciman_charles_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-CR">Runciman</span></a>, 
                        which, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> thought, “resembled” “the cottage that we saw, as we went to Rhaidyr Dhu, near Maentwrog where the old woman lived whose grandson 
                        went with us to the fall, so very silently”

                     <div class="p">When Ruskin showed his drawing to Runciman, the drawing master "contemplated it for a moment in silence,  
                        & then turning asked me, if I had copied? I told him how I had patched it up, 
                        but he said that that was not copying, & although he was not satisfied with the picture,
                        he said that there was something in it, that would make him totally change the method he had hitherto pursued with me" 
                        (<a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1832-02-27_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter of <span class="date-1832-02-27">27 February 1832</span></span></a> [<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a> 267]).
                        
                        In the poems, however, he does not draw on the tradition of topographical landscape description; rather, 
                        he is preoccupied with Byron, turning to that model appropriately for representation of the sublime in mountain and ocean scenery, 
                        the mode of viewing that was typically associated with the tour of northern Wales 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#ANDREWSPICTURESQUE" target="_self">Andrews, <i>The Search for the Picturesque</i></a>, 111). 
                        Somewhat eccentrically, Ruskin fixates less on Byron's descriptive poetry in <i>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</i> as examples of the sublime 
                        than on the gothic elements of mountain and aerial "spirits" in <span class="title-drama-BYRONMANFRED"><i>Manfred</i></span>.

                        is Ruskin's running commentary on his classical studies and his jocular (and often incorrect) usages of Latin and Greek to comment on his lessons and other events 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, e.g. 257, 263, 268-69, 273).</div> 
                     
                     <div class="p">Meanwhile, as had also been the case with draft of shorter works in <a href="/apparatuses/msvi_apparatus" target="_self">MS VI</a>, 
                       <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> fair‐copied some lyric works from MS VIII into <a href="/apparatuses/msv_apparatus" target="_self">MS V</a>, 
                       which he entitled “Miscellaneous Poetry,” although he left many such works to remain in draft alone, in both <a href="/apparatuses/msvi_apparatus" target="_self">MS VI</a> and MS VIII; and he fair‐copied occasional poetry, such as New Year‐s and birthday odes, as separate presentation copies 
                            (bound into <a href="/apparatuses/msia_apparatus" target="_self">MS IA</a> and <a href="/apparatuses/msxi_apparatus" target="_self">MS XI</a> by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskinʼs</span> editors). This larger pattern of composition and fair‐copying, overlapping with that for <a href="/apparatuses/msvi_apparatus" target="_self">MS VI</a>, is sustained throughout 
                            Contents, section <i>a</i>, from <span class="date-1831-09-22-1831-12-21">fall 1831</span> through <span class="date-1833-03-20-1833-06-21">spring 1833</span>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">A change in this pattern emerges when, in Contents, section <i>b</i>, “Athens” is displaced as the principal long work 
                            by <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus" target="_self">Account of a Tour on the Continent</a>. 
                            The pattern is maintained insofar as Ruskin probably fair‐copied “The Account” almost simultaneously, into <a href="/apparatuses/msix_apparatus" target="_self">MS IX</a>, 
                            but composition of “The Account” differs in taking over the notebook completely, from <span class="date-1833-09-22-1833-12-21">fall 1833</span> through spring and <span class="date-1834-06-21-1834-07-22">early summer 1834</span>. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> does not alternate brief stints of the longer work 
                            with composition of shorter lyrics, except to take up draft of occasional works, for which purpose he jumps ahead to an unused section (e.g., Contents, sections <i>c</i> and 
                            <i>d</i>. This change can be partly explained by the nature of the “Account” itself, which apparently evolved from an exclusively metrical topographical work 
                            into a compound genre, of poetry, prose, and illustration. Composition of the work entailed its own varying of interest and literary/artistic form.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">As explained in <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus#DISCUSSION" target="_self">Account of a Tour on the Continent: Discussion</a>, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> modeled this anthology‐like approach to composing “The Account” on publications of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span> that exhibit mixed forms dependent on new printing technologies—for example, the 
                            topographical work, , by <span class="persName-SR">Samuel Rogers</span>, which <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> republished as a popular illustrated book in <span class="date-1830">1830</span>, 
                            its large volume of production and wide distribution made possible by the new stee engraving. 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was also imitating the prose writing typical of the illustrated landscape annuals of the period. 
                            Thus, in the “Account” section of MS VIII (section <i>b</i>), <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            might be understood as not so much as abandoning his earlier procedure of afternating draft of epic verse with draft of briefer lyrics, 
                            as finding and developing a model for a single project that accommodated his preference for varying genres. In this regard, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> simply aligns his existing compositional habits 
                            with features of publications of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span> aimed at the <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">British</span> middle class, especially travel and ekphrastic publication.
                        </div>
                     
                     <div class="p">What must have been somewhat unexpected, however, and what wrenches the use of MS VIII away from the familiar pattern of <a href="/apparatuses/msvi_apparatus" target="_self">MS VI</a>, 
                            is that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself enters that publishing scene in 1834–35 as the author, “J.R.,” 
                            when he becomes a contributor to <a href="/notes/friendships_offering_note" target="_self"><span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span></a>. 
                            That transition—which was brought about by the “Account,” which was mined for the poems making up 
                            <a href="/apparatuses/fragments_from_a_metrical_journal_apparatus" target="_self">“Fragments from a Metrical Journal”</a>, published in the gift annual—is 
                            most directly represented in MS VIII by the displacement of draft of “Account” with draft of 
                            <a href="/apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus" target="_self">“Saltzburg”</a>, commissioned specifically to accompany an engraving for the annual. 
                            Perhaps Contents, section <i>e</i> should likewise be understood as a new use for Ruskin of a rough‐draft notebook, 
                            a use focused less on generating draft for fair‐copy presentation within the family circle, and more on developing writing for publication. 
                        </div>
                     
                     <div class="p">If so, the question arises of the subsequent relation between public and private writing in MS VIII. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskinʼs</span> editors associated sections <i>e</i> and <i>g</i> 
                            with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskinʼs</span> alleged crush on <span class="persName-ACD">Adèle Domecq</span>, based on his story in <i>Praeterita</i>, which frames this infatuation in terms of poetic 
                            composition. To understand these sections of MS VIII more clearly, this lyric writing from <span class="date-1835">1835</span> and beyond needs, like “Account,” to be detached from its autobiographical coloring, 
                            and set in relation to the material culture of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. Connected with these questions may be the phenomenon of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskinʼs</span> unusally protracted use of MS VIII, 
                            extending perhaps as late as <span class="date-1838">1838</span>.
                        </div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Other work that engaged <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> simultaneously with MS VIII, in addition to the fair‐copy manuscripts already mentioned, include 
                            the <a href="/apparatuses/sermons_on_the_pentateuch" target="_self">Sermons on the Pentateuch</a> (MSS IIA‐E), composed and fair‐copied <span class="date-1832">1832</span> through <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, and

                            sponsor <span class="persName-JR">Ruskinʼs</span> emergence onto the public scene in another role, as a scientific author with papers in The Magazine of Natural History:
