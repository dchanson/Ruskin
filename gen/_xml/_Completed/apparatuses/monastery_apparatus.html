                        based on his analysis of the sequence in which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> entered poetry selections in <a href="/apparatuses/msiii_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a> (see <a href="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</a>; and see

                        <span class="persName-ETC">E. T. Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Alexander Wedderburn</span> disagreed 
                        and ascribed the work to <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, in the belief that the poem was “a result of [<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs] visit 
                        to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> in that year”

                        <span class="persName-HGV">Helen Viljoen</span> was initially inclined to accept the earlier date, because she considered the hand in the 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/msia_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span></a> draft to be “very childish”, but then she decided that 
                        <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> had “no legitimate basis” 
                        for correcting <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs date of <span class="date-1828">1828</span>

                  <div class="p">The reasoning by the editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> seems to stand on the most speculative evidence—namely, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs comment in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span> 
                        that he “used to read the <span class="title-book-SCOTTABBOT"><i>Abbot</i></span> at <span class="placeName-KINROSS">Kinross</span>, 
                        and the <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY"><i>Monastery</i></span> in <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Glen Farg</span>” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 2:260 n. 1; 35:16). 
                        While <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may well have associated <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>ʼs novels with landmarks along the Ruskinsʼ route to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> in the <span class="date-1820-01-01-1829-12-31">1820s</span>, 
                        the editors neglect to explain why these associations should be tied so specifically to the journey of <span class="date-1827">1827</span>. It is not known when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> first read <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY"><i>Monastery</i></span> 
                        or heard it read to him. The case is strengthened, however, by the contents of <a href="/apparatuses/msiii_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a>, 
                        the manuscript containing the fair copy of <span class="title-poem-JRMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span>. Immediately preceding 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem occurs the anthology, <a href="/apparatuses/poetry_discriptive_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“poetry discriptive”</span></a>, 
                        which includes poems describing <span class="placeName-building-LOCHLEVENCAS">Loch Leven Castle</span> and <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Glen Farg</span>—the 
                        points along the journey to <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> that, according to <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> connected with his reading of <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs novels. (In fact, it may have been this evidence in 
                        <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> that originally prompted <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs comment in the autobiography, 
                        rather than this evidence independently documenting his memory.)</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">In using this statement in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span> 
                        to link <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span> to the family journey to <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> in <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, 
                        the editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> evidently did not base their conclusion on the juxtaposition of the poem with a small anthology of poems in <a href="/apparatuses/msiii_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a>, 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/poetry_discriptive_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“poetry discriptive”</span></a>, 
                        probably because they believed the latter to date from <span class="date-1826">1826</span> 
                        (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 2:260 n. 1, and see 2:535). 
                        The poems in <span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“poetry discriptive”</span> do in fact belong to the family tour of <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, thus tending to confirm <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>ʼs speculations. 
                        <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span>ʼs qualms about a date this early can be resolved by evidence that this tour fell unusually late in <span class="date-1827">1827</span>—primarily 
                        in <span class="date-1827-08-1827-11">September and October, with departure sometime in August, and return sometime in November</span> 
                        (see <a href="/notes/tours_of_1826-27_note" target="_self">Tours of <span class="date-1826-1827">1826–27</span></a>).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">The evidence is more indirect regarding whether <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span> specifically—or at least its first one or two books—should be considered as contemporaneous 
                        with the circa <span class="date-1827-08-1827-11">August–November 1827</span> <span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“poetry discriptive”</span> project—or, 
                        as <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> contends, an insertion in that place in <a href="/apparatuses/msiii_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a> at a later time. As explained in 
                        <a href="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</a>, the only documented record of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs labor 
                        on <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span> dates from <span class="date-1829-03">March 1829</span>, 
                        and even that passing reference in a letter is somewhat ambiguous. The statement might mean that, at that time, he was returning to composition and/or fair copy of the poem itself, 
                        or that he was working on something in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>, a manuscript that he simply identified by its happening to contain <span class="title-poem-JRMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span>—that is, 
                        the <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self">Red Book</a> known in the family for its containing the poem, 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span>. Based on the concatenation of evidence 
                        in <a href="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</a>, it appears likely that, in <span class="date-1829-03">March 1829</span>, 
                        he did compose and/or fair‐copy some portion of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span>—probably, 
                        books 3–4 (which he left incomplete)—while books 1–2 date from an earlier period. This period may be as early as 
                        <span class="date-1827-08-1827-11">between August and November 1827</span>, but more likely date from some time in <span class="date-1828">1828</span>. 
                        As for the poemʼs associations with travel to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>, rather than deriving from the <a href="/notes/tours_of_1826-27_note" target="_self"><span class="date-1827">Tour of 1827</span></a>, 
                        the poem could equally be connected with the sadder occasion of mourning the loss of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <a href="/notes/richardson_jessie_note" target="_self"></a><span class="persName-JRP">Aunt Jessie</span>, 
                        who died in <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> in <span class="date-1828-05">May 1828</span>.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">The <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> fair copy of book 3 shares some handwriting features with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <a href="/notes/new_years_poems_note" target="_self"><span class="date-1829-01-01">New Yearʼs 1829</span> productions</a>,

                        immediately follows a group of poems entitled

                        There is no physical break between the anthology and the “novel” to indicate a change in genre or project, 
                        so it is possible that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> considered <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span> to be a continuation of the <a href="/apparatuses/poetry_discriptive_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“poetry discriptive”</span></a>. 
                        Given the inclusion in <span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“poetry discriptive”</span> of travel poems 
                        about <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Glenfarg</span> and <span class="placeName-building-LOCHLEVENCAS">Loch Leven</span>, 
                        and the juxtaposition of these poems with the verse novel, this portion of <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> 
                        bears witness to (and may even have inspired) <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs autobiographical recollection that he 
                        “used to read the <span class="title-book-SCOTTABBOT"><i>Abbot</i></span> at <span class="placeName-KINROSS">Kinross</span>,

                        which I confused with ‘<span class="geogName-GLENDEARG">Glendearg</span>’ [the fictional setting of the novel; see <a href="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</a>, and see also 
                        <a href="/notes/glenfarg_place_note" target="_self"><span class="placeName-GLENFARG">Glenfarg</span> (place)</a>]”. 
                        He “thought”, he goes on in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, “that the <span class="persName-fictional-WHITELADY">White Lady</span> had as certainly lived by the streamlet [the <span class="geogName-FARG">Farg</span>] in that glen of the <span class="geogName-OCHILS">Ochils</span>,

                        As further evidence shows, however, while <span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“poetry discriptive”</span> establishes a lower limit 
                        in the time of composition for <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span>, the two projects were distinct.</div>

                        for composition of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span>, how much time separated the verse novel from the tour poem anthology? For this question, the only evidence is handwriting. 
                        The hand for the verse novel uses print lettering similar to that for <a href="/apparatuses/poetry_discriptive_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“poetry discriptive”</span></a>, but generally smaller. 
                        Size of lettering in fact varies considerably within the anthology itself, the smallest being used for its first poem, 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/ragland_castle_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRRAGLANDCASTLE">“Ragland Castle”</span></a>. Still, regardless of size, and despite the similarity in formation of letters, 
                        there is greater affinity between the lettering throughout the poems in <a href="/apparatuses/poetry_discriptive_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“poetry discriptive”</span></a> 
                        and the lettering used for the original versions of two of its poems, <a href="/apparatuses/wales_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRWALES">“Wales”</span></a> and 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/spring_blank_verse_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRSPRINGBLANKVERSE">“Spring: Blank Verse”</span></a> 
                        (as first fair‐copied in a <a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1827-05_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-"><span class="date-1827-05">May 1827</span> letter</span></a> by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> to his father), 
                        than between the respective hands for the poetry anthology and for <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span>.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">The orthography of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span> is distinctive for its studied attention to punctuation, which is largly neglected in the <span class="date-1827">1827</span> fair copies 
                        of <a href="/apparatuses/wales_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRWALES">“Wales”</span></a>, <a href="/apparatuses/spring_blank_verse_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRSPRINGBLANKVERSE">“Spring: Blank Verse”</span></a> as well as the poems in <a href="/apparatuses/poetry_discriptive_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“poetry discriptive”</span></a>. 
                        In book 1 and the first eighty lines of book 2, almost every line of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span> ends with punctuation, most frequently a prominent comma formed to look like book print, with a dot and a curl, although the commas 
                        hover above the baseline like a swimming tadpole. There are also semicolons, which are almost consistently formed upside down, with the comma above the point. 
                        The eccentricity of the punctuation resembles the usage in <a href="/apparatuses/eudosia_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">“Eudosia”</span></a> in <a href="/apparatuses/msiv_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span></a>. Here, too, the commas are typeface‐like, 
                        though they now fall on the baseline; and there are no upside‐down semicolons in <span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">“Eudosia”</span>, although a new oddity turns up in the form of a two‐point ellipsis, like a colon on its side, its function unclear. 
                        (<span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span> is also punctuated with colons, but their rhetorical or grammatical function is obscure.) 
                        What most tellingly links the punctuation practice in <a href="/apparatuses/eudosia_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">“Eudosia”</span></a> with that in <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span> 
                        is that, in both cases, the dense but confusing marks abruptly give out altogether after several pages of fair‐copying, suggesting that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> added the punctuation all at once, 
                        layering the marks over top of the already fair‐copied text. Evidently, he had not yet learned to integrate punctuation as a rhetorical and grammatical element of writing, 
                        but treated it effectively as a decorative feature in fair copy, as if to enhance the imitation of typeface. He used almost no punctuation when drafting the poem, 
                        as witnessed by the two draft fragments in <a href="/apparatuses/msia_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span></a>,

                        (See also <a href="/apparatuses/constellations_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span></a>, which, in its 
                        <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span> fair copy, exhibits the decorative rather than rhetorical sprinkling of punctuation marks only at the start of the manuscript, 
                        but which does have the colons turned right‐side up, suggesting a slightly more advanced grasp of usage.)</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself dated <a href="/apparatuses/eudosia_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">“Eudosia”</span></a> as <span class="date-1828-09-28">28 September 1828</span> 
                        (whether he meant the beginning or termination of that project), a timeline takes shape starting with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs first use of pen and ink,

                        and sent the poems in a <a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1827-05_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-"><span class="date-1827-05">May 1827</span> letter</span></a> to his father,

                        While that tour was delayed until <span class="date-1827-08-1827-11">August–November</span>, its product in the

                        orthographically and thematically more akin to <span class="title-poem-JRWALES">“Wales”</span> and 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRSPRINGBLANKVERSE">“Spring: Blank Verse”</span> than to <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span> and

                        This suggests that, despite the lack of a physical separation between <span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“poetry discriptive”</span> and <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span> 
                        in <a href="/apparatuses/msiii_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a>, those two projects were separated by a number of months,

                        “<span class="smallcaps"><span class="placeName-building-HERNE">HERNE HILL</span></span> / <span class="smallcaps"><span class="placeName-DULWIICH">DULWICH</span></span>”. No evidence proves when he inserted the direction to “go back to page 52”, 
                        but handwriting evidence in book 3 suggests that he took up that phase at a different time and under other circumstances. This division in the stages 
                        of composition is further supported by the two separate surviving witnesses of rough draft in <a href="/apparatuses/msia_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span></a>, 
                        <a href="/witnesses/now_must_we_leave_poor_martin_there_msia" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-">“now must we leave poor martin there”</span></a> and 
                        <a href="/witnesses/come_on_good_horse_and_let_us_see_msia" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-">“come on good horse and let us see”</span></a>. 
                        The first, which is a draft of a portion of book 2, is written in cursive with pencil; the second, which is a draft of a portion of book 3, 
                        is written in cursive with pen and ink. When <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> first began to use pen and ink in <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, he restricted his penmanship to fair‐copying in print letters, 
                        while continuing to rely on pencil for cursive script. Later, he transitioned to pen and ink for both draft in cursive and fair copy in print lettering 
                        (see <a href="/notes/hand_note" target="_self">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</a>). 
                        An example of the former is <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1827-05_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-"><span class="date-1827-05">May 1827</span> letter</span></a> to his father,

                        <a href="/apparatuses/spring_blank_verse_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRSPRINGBLANKVERSE">“Spring: Blank Verse”</span></a>, in ink print lettering, 
                        but wrote the body text of the letter in pencil cursive. An example of the latter is the <span class="date-1828-01-01-1829-12-31">1828–29</span> handmade pamphlet, <a href="/apparatuses/msii_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS II</span></a>,

                        which are fair‐copied in ink print lettering elsewhere.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Since the first stage of composition probably comprised books 1–2 in <span class="date-1828">1828</span>, what occasioned the work? A conjecture based on internal evidence, 
                        and in keeping with the physical evidence for dating and composition, is the death of <a href="/notes/richardson_jessie_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-JRP">Janet (“Jessie”) Richardson</span></a>, 
                        the sister of <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, in <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> 
                        on <span class="date-1828-05-18">18 May 1828</span>. As internal evidence of this connection, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> condensed and rearranged opening episodes of <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs novel to emphasize its supernatural and spiritual aspects 
                        (see <a href="#ARRANGEMENTOFEPISODES"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs Arrangement of Episodes from <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs Novel</a>). In addition, 
                        as an internal reflection of the immediate consequence of <span class="persName-JRP">Jessie</span>ʼs death—the Ruskinsʼ adoption of the only surviving Richardson daughter, 
                        <a href="/notes/richardson_mary_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span></a>, into the <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> household—<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs 
                        book 2 is a detailed rendering of an episode that tangentially concerns adoption. In the novel, a benign captain of an English raiding party, <span class="persName-fictional-STAWARTHBOLTON">Stawarth Bolton</span>, 
                        confronts <span class="persName-fictional-ELSPETGLENDINNING">Elspet Glendinning</span> and her two sons, and half‐jokingly offers to adopt either the “blue eyed” and reverential younger brother, <span class="persName-fictional-EDWARDGLENDINNING">Edward</span>, 
                        or the “black eyed” and feisty older brother, <span class="persName-fictional-HALBERTGLENDINNING">Halbert</span>. For <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>, the purpose of the episode was primarily to dramatize the English policy, following their 
                        victory at the <span class="date-1547-09-10">Battle of Pinkie Cleuch</span>, of balancing assurances of protection for compliant Scots, especially Protestants, with threats of destruction against defiant 
                        Scots patriots (see <a href="#HISTORICALCONTEXT">Discussion: The Historical Context of <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs Novel</a>).</div>

                        The pages occupied by these two books (pp. 52–58, plus three blanks, pp. 59–61) 
                        take up the available leaves in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> that fall between pages containing

                        unquestionably presented him with a terminus ad quem for available space, while a terminus a quo was likely already present 
                        in the form of the <span class="title-anthology-MSIIIPOETRYANTHOLOGY3">MS III Third Poetry Anthology</span>, dated <span class="date-1829-03-09">9 March 1829</span>

                        to resume book 3 on p. 52 arbitrarily, with nothing in particular framing that space. Rather, one can assume, when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        reported to his father on <span class="date-1829-03-10">10 March 1829</span> that he was determined to “get that <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self">red book</a> of mine

                        with its prominent and repeated datelines “<span class="date-1829-03">March 1829</span>” and “<span class="date-1829-03-09">March 9th 1829</span>” scattered throughout

                        By interspersing the date <span class="date-1829-03-09">9 March 1829</span> among that group of poems, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was evidently concerned to demonstrate his success in meeting this deadline 
                        (see the commentary on the first poem copied in the <span class="date-1829-03-09">March 9</span> group,

                        with marginal line numbering trailing into unfilled space on p. 58 and three available pages left blank. 
                        By this time, his attention must have been diverted from the narrative poem—which, in any case, conceptually presented an endless drudgery, with thirty chapters remaining 
                        in <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs novel to be versified, not to mention the novelʼs sequel, <span class="title-book-SCOTTABBOT"><i>The Abbot</i></span>—and 
                        he was now absorbed in composing a major loco‐descriptive poem for his fatherʼs <span class="date-1829-05-10">10 May 1829</span> birthday,

                        He turned aside from a gothic narrative, which for him was entangled with connections in <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> that had been severed by death, 
                        in exchange for a poem in the picturesque mode for his fatherʼs birthday, a poem that reopened a desire for the <span class="geogName-LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</span> that had been thwarted during the

                        suggests that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> reused the sheet after it was torn—damage that partially obscured the penciled lines on the verso, 
                        but leaving him with a blank side, the recto, to compose the subsequent text in ink 
                        (see <a href="/apparatuses/msia_apparatus" target="_self">MS IA Apparatus</a>).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">This interpretation, which assumes straightforward continuity of composition—from verso, to recto, and back to verso, with intervening mutilation of the sheet—is 
                        not contradicted by the three lines (60–62) continued at the top of the verso, since those lines are complete, unaffected by the tearing. 
                        This reconstruction does fail to explain, however, why <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would have switched from pen and ink back to pencil 
                        for the final three lines on the verso. It seems odd that he would have put down his pen at the bottom of the recto and returned to pencil.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">As an alternative explanation, the ink text on the recto may be viewed as representing, not part of a continuous act of composition looping around both sides of the sheet, 
                        but a discontinuous intervention. The ink text might represent a copy or new version of a witness, now unknown, that had carried on with the text from the verso, starting from line 26, 
                        <span class="title-manuscript-">“come on good horse and let us see”</span>. The ink text, moreover, contains significant revision in itself, 
                        in the form of complex substitutions. These changes are encoded in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> witness and discussed in an accompanying textual gloss. 
                        If, in addition, the ink text represents an intervention prior to this revision, then the manuscript pays double witness to perplexity that 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> encountered in versifying this section of <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs novel. See

                            whereby <span class="persName-KH8">Henry VIII</span> sought to force a union between his son and heir, <span class="persName-">Edward</span> (<span class="date-1537-10-12-1553-07-06">1537–53</span>), and the infant <span class="persName-MQS">Mary Stewart</span>

                            “They speak about the wedding of the <span class="persName-">Prince</span> and our <span class="persName-MQS">Queen</span>”, observes <span class="persName-fictional-ELSPETGLENDINNING">Elspet Glendinning</span> near the beginning of the novel. 
                            <span class="persName-KH8">Henry</span> hoped to break <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>ʼs traditional alliance with <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span> and annex the country as part of assuring the Tudor succession. 
                            In <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>, a treaty to this effect was guided by <span class="persName-JHEA">James Hamilton, earl of Arran</span> (<span class="date-1519-1575-01-22">1519–75</span>), 
                            who had been appointed governor of <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> and tutor to the child <span class="persName-">Mary</span> upon the death of <span class="persName-KJ5">James V</span>. 
                            As a Protestant, <span class="persName-JHEA">Arran</span> had been the first to propose the future union of the two royal heirs. 
                            At home, however, an anti‐English faction quickly formed against him, composed of clergy and nobles. The Scottish parliament 
                            did prepare a treaty agreeing to the marriage, but preserving Scottish sovereignty, terms that <span class="persName-KH8">Henry</span> was unlikely to accept, as he pursued increasingly aggressive conditions for the agreement. 
                            The arrangement foundered, with the Scottish parliament now condemning the treaty; Mary was crowned queen of Scots; 
                            and the anti‐English, pro‐Catholic faction reaffirmed the Auld Alliance with <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span>. 
                            <span class="persName-KH8">Henry</span> was incensed, determined to force the marriage, and to claim overlordship of <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> 
                            with no allowance for separate sovereignty. Accordingly, he appointed troops under <span class="persName-ESEH">Edward Seymour, earl of Hertford</span> (<span class="date-1500-1552-01-22">1500–52</span>), to “put all to fyre and swoord”. 
                            In two campaigns, <span class="persName-ESEH">Hertford</span> destroyed portions of <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span>, and he captured castles and monasteries around the <span class="geogName-FIRTHOFFORTH">Firth of Forth</span>,

                            sought a new approach to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>. Temporary raids would give way to a campaign for permanent occupation, 
                            while compliant Scots would be offered assurances, with a view to establishing a Protestant Britain. <span class="persName-ESEH">Somerset</span> marched an army north in <span class="date-1547-09">September 1547</span> 
                            and won a decisive victory at the <span class="date-1547-09-10">Battle of Pinkie Cleuch</span>, 
                            near <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span>. This battle, along with the English raids surrounding it, forms the historical reference point at the start of <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY"><i>The Monastery</i></span>—the 
                            conflict that made widows of both <span class="persName-fictional-LADYAVENEL">Lady Avenel</span> and her neighboring yeomanʼs wife, <span class="persName-ficitonal-ELSPETGLENDINNING">Elspet Glendinning</span>. 
                            As dramatized by the novelʼs opening encounter between an occupying English soldier and <span class="persName-fictional-ELSPETGLENDINNING">Elspet</span> and her two sons—the 
                            lads barely able to contain their defiance of the “heretic” Englishman—the military victory not only failed to quell Scottish resistance, 
                            but also helped to undermine the Scottish Protestant interests that <span class="persName-ESEH">Somerset</span> hoped to enlist. <span class="persName-MG">Mary of Guise</span> successfully concluded

                            hatred of the English invaders and the reaffirmation of the Auld Alliance put Scottish Protestants on the defensive, 
                            hesitant to look to <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span> for support—a hope that soon turned even less tenable with the accession of the English Catholic queen, <span class="persName-QM1">Mary I</span>

                            as well, Scottish Protestants were again emboldened to look to <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span> for a common cause of resistance. Religious divisions in <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> deepened,

                            however, as <span class="persName-PFIELDING">Penny Fielding</span> explains, <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span> deliberately avoided specifying dates and treated chronology loosely in <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY"><i>The Monastery</i></span>.

                            This warped chronology has no effect on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs project of versifying the novel, 
                            which never extended beyond the opening chapters set in the aftermath of the <span class="date-1547-09-10">Battle of Pinkie</span>.

                                    The action begins with a monk (<span class="persName-fictional-FATHERPHILIP">Father Philip</span>, the sacristan of 
                                    the <span class="placeName-fictional-SAINTMARYMONASTERY">Monastery of Saint Mary</span>) being 
                                    denied passage over the <span class="geogName-TWEEDRIVER">Tweed</span> by the warder of the drawbridge. 
                                    Preparing to ford the river on his mule, he encounters the <span class="persName-fictional-WHITELADY">White Lady</span>. 
                                    Supposing her to be a woman stranded on the bank by the churlish bridge‐ward, he offers to carry her across the stream, 
                                    only to be thrown from his mount by the spirit, when they reach deep water. While <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem mentions that 
                                    <span class="persName-fictional-FATHERPHILIP">the monk</span> grasps “a black volume”—<span class="persName-fictional-LADYAVENEL">Lady Avenel</span>ʼs vernacular bible, 
                                    which <span class="persName-fictional-FATHERPHILIP">Father Philip</span> has confiscated—the poem omits explanation of <span class="persName-fictional-FATHERPHILIP">Philip</span>ʼs discovery 
                                    of the forbidden book on a pastoral visit to the <span class="placeName-fictional-TOWEROFGLENDEARG">Tower of Glendearg</span>, 
                                    where <span class="persName-fictional-LADYAVENEL">Lady Avenel</span> and her daughter are residing. 
                                    The poem also passes over the monksʼ expressions of zeal (in <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs chapters 5, 6, and 7) 
                                    to crush heretical Reform ideas infiltrating the halidome. Cutting to the end of <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs chapter 7, 
                                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> follows <span class="persName-fictional-FATHERPHILIP">Philip</span> home to the monastery, 
                                    where, still amazed and gibbering snatches of the <span class="persName-fictional-WHITELADY">White Lady</span>ʼs song, he is interviewed by

                                 <li><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> efficiently condenses the introduction of the main Scottish characters. 
                                    He touches on the <span class="date-1547-09-10">Battle of Pinkie</span> to explain conditions at the <span class="placeName-fictional-TOWEROFGLENDEARG">Tower of Glendearg</span>, which is bereft of its master, the yeoman <span class="persName-fictional-SIMONGLENDINNING">Simon Glendinning</span>; 
                                    and (skipping to the opening of <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs chapter 3), he draws a parallel with the estate of Avenel, 
                                    likewise absent of its baron, <span class="persName-fictional-WALTERAVENEL">Walter Avenel</span>, who has been killed “for the good of his country in battle”. Still continuing with <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs chapter 3, 
                                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> introduces the widow, <span class="persName-fictional-LADYAVENEL">Alice, Lady Avenel</span> 
                                    and her daughter, <span class="persName-fictional-MARYAVENEL">Mary Avenel</span>. Thus, he reverses the order in which characters are introduced in the novel, 
                                    which begins in <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs chapter two with the yeomanʼs widow, <span class="persName-fictional-ELSPETGLENDINNING">Elspet Glendinning</span>, and her two sons—<span class="persName-fictional-HALBERTGLENDINNING">Halbert</span>, the elder; and <span class="persName-fictional-EDWARDGLENDINNING">Edward</span>, the younger. 
                                    By beginning with the knighted class of characters, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> maintains a connection with the “avenel haunt” that he introduces in book 1, 
                                    though at the cost of some confusion over what “foe” drives <span class="persName-fictional-LADYAVENEL">Lady Avenel</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-MARYAVENEL">Mary</span> to seek refuge in the farmerʼs cottage 
                                    of <span class="persName-fictional-MTACKET">Martin</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-TTACKET">Tibb Tacket</span>, 
                                    whom <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> introduces here, as does <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span> in chapter 3. The threat that alarms them, of “english barbarians that plunder the land”, 
                                    refers to <span class="persName-ESEH">Somerset</span>ʼs occupation of the Border after <span class="date-1547-09-10">Pinkie Cleuch</span>, 
                                    and his attempt to win over Scottish Protestants by combining the coercion of raids with the persuasion of assurances. 
                                    This context is supplied as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> swings back to <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs chapter two, 
                                    and the confrontation between the English captain, <span class="persName-fictional-STAWARTHBOLTON">Stawarth Bolton</span>, 
                                    and <span class="persName-fictional-ELSPETGLENDINNING">Dame Glendinning</span> and her two sons. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> dwells on this episode in considerable detail, 
                                    clearly finding great interest in the boysʼ contrasting personalities and their respective responses to <span class="persName-fictional-STAWARTHBOLTON">Bolton</span>ʼs bestowal of his protection and 
                                    his half‐joking offer to adopt either of the boys.</li>

                                    Losing their way, the party is stranded in a dangerous bog. As the pony <span class="name--SHAGRAMSCOTTMONASTERY">Shagram</span>, who is carrying 
                                    <span class="persName-fictional-MARYAVENEL">Mary</span>, shies from moving forward, the girl observes 
                                    a fair lady, whom no one else can see—the <span class="persName-fictional-WHITELADY">White Lady</span>—signaling 
                                    to the party to follow her on a path to safety. <span class="persName-fictional-TTACKET">Tibb</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-MTACKET">Martin</span> exchange apprehensions about fairies. 
                                    The narrator draws briefly on an exchange between <span class="persName-fictional-ELSPETGLENDINNING">Dame Glendinning</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-TTACKET">Tibb Tacket</span> 
                                    in chapter 4 to explain the haunting of the House of Avenel by the <span class="persName-fictional-WHITELADY">White Lady</span>.</li>

                            <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span> admitted that the <span class="persName-fictional-WHITELADY">White Lady</span> “was far from being popular” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#SCOTTWORKSCALEDONIAN" target="_self"><span class="title-book-CALEDONIANEDITION"><i>Works</i>, Caledonian Edition</span></a>, 17:xx).

                            considered the <span class="persName-fictional-WHITELADY">White Lady</span> merely “opportune”, her “insufferable” manifestations ludicrously suggesting the meddling of a “female Puck or Robin Goodfellow”

                            Such “machinery is introduced to no ultimate purpose”, chimed in the <span class="title-periodical-EDINBURGHMONTHLYREVIEW"><i>Edinburgh Monthly Review</i></span>,

                            At the same time, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> felt the mystery of the <span class="persName-fictional-WHITELADY">White Lady</span>, as suggested by the incantation with which he begins his poem. 
                            In capturing this mood of the novel, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs response might be compared to that of the reviewer for <span class="title-periodical-BLACKWOODSMAGAZINE"><i>Blackwoodʼs Edinburgh Magazine</i></span>, 
                            who was untroubled by the other reviewersʼ standard for a credible plot, instead finding merit 
                            in “the <i>reading</i> of the <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">Monastery</span>” as “a calm enjoyment” (emphasis in original): “Nothing can be more delightful; 
                            but nothing at the same time can be more quiet. The different scenes spread themselves out in a fine variegated and easy succession”. 
                            The reviewer relates this unfolding of varying scenes and moods to what he or she imagines <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs experience to have been when composing the novel. 
                            In the aftermath of the authorʼs previous “extraordinary exertions” over <span class="title-book-SCOTTIVANHOE"><i>Ivanhoe</i></span>, the reviewer believes, <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span> was 
                            “induced . . . to linger so very near home” in the novelʼs Border setting, and “to luxuriate over the silence of his own pastoral glens, 
                            the music of his own haunted mountain‐brooks—and the calm domestic magnificence of that unrivalled landscape” and “stately beauty of <span class="placeName-building-MELROSEABBEY">Melrose</span>”

                            may have been prompted by the death of his <span class="persName-JRP">Aunt Jessie</span> in <span class="date-1828-05">May 1828</span>, and the adoption of his cousin,

                            These events can be seen reflected in the outcome of

                            as constituting a work in itself, finished off with a colophon on p. 80. Book 1 narrates a haunting by a supernatural spirit of Scottish lore, 
                            followed by book 2 and its banter about possible adoption—the latter being almost the sole theme represented in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> draft fragment of book 2. Even the comedy in book 1,

                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> recalls in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span> returning from a walk with his nurse, <a href="/notes/strachan_anne_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-ASB">Anne Strachan</span></a>, “on the hill east of the town                            [<span class="geogName-PLYMOUTHHOE">Plymouth Hoe</span>], looking out on the bay and breakwater, and came in to find my father, for the first time I had ever seen him,

                            continuing to visit sites in the southwest. There is no evidence that they traveled to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>, but <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have begun stage one of composition 
                            of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span> soon after the return home. Cousin <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> came to <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span>

                            an event that may well have put <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in mind of the two families, the Avenels and the Glendinnings, 
                            coming together in a single household in <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY"><i>The Monastery</i></span>. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may even have been conscious of some class tension surrounding 
                            the adoption of his northern cousin—just as, in the novel, the two widows, <span class="persName-fictional-LADYAVENEL">Lady Avenel</span> 
                            and <span class="persName-fictional-ELSPETGLENDINNING">Dame Glendinning</span>, form an amiable relationship, while maintaining class differences

                            before <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> directly acknowledged her passing in <a href="/apparatuses/on_the_death_of_my_cousin_jessy_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRDEATHOFJESSY">“On the Death of My Cousin Jessy”</span></a>.

                            contributed to delaying the Ruskinsʼ <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> journey in <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, and then solemnized the long two‐month visit in <span class="date-1827-09-1827-10">September and October</span>

                            This death too, then, would have contributed to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs feelings when choosing to summarize <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs novel in the next year.</div>

                            One might speculate that the omission was related to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs alarm over his fatherʼs vulnerability, exposed to him

                            While <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was perhaps not equal to or interested in versifying the more polemical passages of the novel—passages that, 
                            in any case, conveyed a more judicious view of the Protestant‐Catholic divide during the Reformation than his mother would have approved—he 
                            did, as previously suggested, implicitly favor the Protestant cause through his arrangement of episodes

                            in the view of most reviewers of <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs novel, have only confirmed what they regarded as the “childishness” of those episodes

                            specifically rejected a rational, historicized explanation of spiritual phenomena in the novel. In the the draft fragment,

                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> initially wrote that it was the family “avenels fate / 
                            to see things that nobody saw / except themselves, and would say pshaw”. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> deleted this gruff expression of skepticism

                            to have a spirit in their line / and so it was this odd time”. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs source passage in the novel 
                            contained a cue that would have allowed for the “pshaw”, or at least for a more politely noncommital expression, 
                            by relegating the <span class="persName-fictional-WHITELADY">White Lady</span>ʼs manifestations

                            suggests that he may have felt a particular challenge assimilating an episode that raises the spectre of a fatherʼs death. The novel may also have challenged <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>

                            when invoking the <span class="persName-fictional-WITCHOFTHEALPS">Witch of the Alps</span>. According to the narrator, <span class="persName-fictional-HALBERTGLENDINNING">Halbert</span> 
                            “‘came hither a boy’” to confront the <span class="persName-fictional-WHITELADY">White Lady</span> 
                            but means to “‘return a man’”, determined to gain the the spiritʼs aid in 
                            “learn[ing] the contents of that mysterious volume”, <span class="persName-fictional-LADYAVENEL">Alice Avenel</span>ʼs vernacular bible, 
                            and to understand “why the <span class="persName-fictional-LADYAVENEL">Lady of Avenel</span> loved it—why the priests feared, and would have stolen it”. 
                            Compared to this scene, <span class="persName-fictional-EDWARDGLENDINNING">Edward Glendinning</span> exhibits no less resolution than his brother,

                            “‘teach you to write and read such beautiful letters as you see there written, and to paint them blue, green, and yellow, and to blazon them with gold’”. 
                            The greatest temptation raised in <span class="persName-fictional-EDWARDGLENDINNING">Edward</span>ʼs mind by the prospect of making graven images is merely to learn to “paint <span class="persName-fictional-MARYAVENEL">Mary</span>ʼs picture”—<span class="persName-fictional-MARYAVENEL">Mary Avenel</span>ʼs,
