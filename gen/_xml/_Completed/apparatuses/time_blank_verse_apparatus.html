                           <div class="p">The idea of <i>time</i> as a trope for a New Yearʼs poem may derive from the <span class="date-1826-01">January 1826</span> issue of the 
                            <a href="/notes/evangelical_magazine_note" target="_self"><span class="title-periodical-EVANGELICALMAG"><i>Evangelical Magazine</i></span></a>. 
                                For each January issue of the magazine, it had become a tradition to devote the monthly “Poetry” section to verse heralding the New Year. 
                                For the <span class="date-1826-01">January 1826</span> issue—the latest New Yearʼs issue that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> could have seen before beginning his own poem—the poem “For the <span class="date-1826-01-01">New Year—1826</span>“ 
                            is subheaded “Time” like <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs own poem for the New Year. The magazineʼs poet is <span class="persName-pen_name-ALIQUIS">Aliquis</span>, a contributor 
                            who gained almost exclusive ownership over this annual feature, developing the genre into a complex, multipart ode that filled the allotted space for poetry 
                            (see <a href="/notes/new_years_poems_note#ODE_TRADITION" target="_self">New Yearʼs Poems: The New Yearʼs Ode Tradition in the <span class="title-periodical-EVANGELICALMAG"><i>Evangelical Magazine</i></span></a>).</div>

                                and the middle part entitled “Eternity”. An epigraph for the whole of the ode contextualizes the opening question of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, 
                                “whats time a figure or a sense”. <span class="persName-pen_name-ALIQUIS">Aliquis</span> quotes <span class="title-scripture-HOSEA">Hosea 12:10</span>, “I have used similitudes” 
                                (the <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">Lord</span> says: “I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets”). 
                                In the first part, “Time”, <span class="persName-pen_name-ALIQUIS">Aliquis</span> proceeds to multiply similitudes, each stanza consisting of a series of figures that compare to an attribute of time. 
                                For example, in stanza one, subtitled “Swift” as one attribute of time, each line presents a similitude to the swift passage of time, 
                                reserving the final line to summarize the attribute in the subtitle:</div>

                           <div class="p">The fatherʼs explanation is underpinned by <span class="persName-JLOCKE">John Locke</span>ʼs psychology. Time can be described only figuratively, not nominally, 
                                since we cannot perceive time as such. <i>Nominal essence</i>, what we name our perceptions of qualities of a sensible object, 
                                is not available for time: as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> remarks of time, “heʼs not a quality of that Iʼm sure”. 
                                While <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> does ascribe qualities to time (“time is so quick”), as does <span class="persName-pen_name-ALIQUIS">Aliquis</span> (“how time incessant flies”), 
                                their qualities are drawn from figural similitudes of swiftness, shortness,
                                and so on, not from observances of time as such. As <span class="persName-pen_name-ALIQUIS">Aliquis</span> asks at the start of the second part of his ode, “Eternity who can define?”</div>

                            apropos of similitudes drawn from the prophets as declared by the epigraph from <span class="title-scripture-HOSEA">Hosea</span> 
                            (and from <span class="title-scripture-JOB">Job</span>, <span class="title-scripture-ECCLESIASTES">Ecclesiastes</span>, and <span class="title-scripture-MATTHEW">Matthew</span> in additional epigraphs for each part), the metaphorical attributes of time constitute an argument for 
                            a darker, more admonitory reflection on the coming New Year than what is suggested by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem. This argument is presented straightforwardly in a letter to the editor, 
                                <span class="title-essay-GBREFLECTIONSEVANGELICALMAG1826-01">“Reflections Suited to the Opening Year”</span>, submitted to the the same issue containing <span class="persName-pen_name-ALIQUIS">Aliquis</span>ʼs ode. 
                            Its tenor is typical of prose pieces submitted to January issues of the <span class="title-periodical-EVANGELICALMAG"><i>Evangelical Magazine</i></span>. The “suitable question with which to commence a new period of our mortal existence” 
                                in the New Year is drawn from <span class="title-scripture-2SAMUEL">2 Samuel 19:34</span>, “How long have I to live?” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#GBREFLECTIONSEVANGELICALMAG1826-01" target="_self"><span class="persName-G_B">G.B.</span>, <span class="title-essay-GBREFLECTIONSEVANGELICALMAG1826-01">“Reflections Suited to the Opening Year”</span></a>, 7). 
                            In the first part of <span class="persName-pen_name-ALIQIUS">Aliquis</span>ʼs ode, the closing lines of each stanza steadily march toward the same bleak question: 
                            “Denote how time incessant flies”—“Prefigure the short life of man”—“Show Timeʼs events uncertain all”—“Timeʼs gifts but vain and false attest”—“For 
                            he shall life immortal gain, / Who lives to <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">God</span>, and dies in peace”. In the second part, if the attributes of eternity, like those of time, cannot be perceived directly, 
                            a picture of eternal life is presented as confidently as the certitude of death. In the third part, a return to scriptural analogies builds toward a millenial promise of “Time” resulting in universal peace 
                            and a world converted to Christianity: “Here jarring sects in one great work unite, / . . . / And every kingdom shall their Saviour own, / And every language shall express his praise”

                                that figure is also circumscribed within a space that excludes reflections on death and transformation, which are encouraged 
                                by contributions to the <span class="title-periodical-EVANGELICALMAG"><i>Evangelical Magazine</i></span>. 
                                In this respect, his poem is narrower compared not only to <span class="persName-pen_name-ALIQUIS">Aliquis</span>ʼs complex ode but even to <span class="persName-JAIKIN">Aikin</span> and <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>ʼs dialogue <span class="title-lesson-AIKINBARBAULDEMBLEMS">“On Emblems”</span>, 
                                which is his evident source for the visible attributes of the emblem, Time. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> omits how, in the dialogue, that emblem is evolved from a traditrional emblem of Death. 
                                The girl, <span class="persName-fictional-CECILIAALB">Cecilia</span>, turns her <span class="persName-fictional-PAPAALB">Papa</span>ʼs attention to that figure. The emphasis of the dialogue, however, unlike the religious purpose of the magazine pieces,

                                which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> omits from his poem. While appropriating the emblematic details from the dialogue, he divorces his figure of Time from that of Death,

                                            But what is his single lock of hair for?</span><br/>
                                 <span class="l"><span class="persName-fictional-CECILIAALB"><i>C</i></span>. I have been thinking, and cannot make it out.</span><br/>
