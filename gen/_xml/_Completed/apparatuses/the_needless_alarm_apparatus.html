                        and other sites in <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span>. The earlier date ascribed by <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> to <a href="/apparatuses/the_steam_engine_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-THESTEAMENGINE">“When furious up from mines the water pours” [“The Steam Engine”]</span></a> turns,
                        moreover, on reasoning that elaborately interprets and even changes what <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> wrote. That argument assumes, first, that <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs note
                        “<span class="date-1826-01">Jan<sup>y</sup> 1826</span>” refers to all four poems preceding the note, not just to <span class="title-poem-THENEEDLESSALARM">“The Needless Alarm”</span>; second, that the first poem of this group
                        to be fair‐copied—<a href="/apparatuses/the_steam_engine_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-THESTEAMENGINE">“When furious up from mines the water pours” [“The Steam Engine”]</span></a>,
                        or “poem I”—must necessarily have been the first composed; and, third, that <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs date,
                        “<span class="date-1826-01">Jan<sup>y</sup> 1826</span>”, “seems to be the date of the note”, according to the editors, “and not of any one of the verses in
                        particular”. That is, in this view, “<span class="date-1826-01">Jan<sup>y</sup> 1826</span>” applies to the note that follows, “this book begun about <span class="date-1826-09-1827-10">Sep<sup>t</sup> or Oct 1826</span> / finished about <span class="date-1827-01">Jan<sup>y</sup> 1827</span>”. 
                        The obvious discrepancy in this argument is explained by the editors as the writerʼs mistake: “perhaps, writing at the
                        beginning of a new year, <span class="persName-MR">Mrs. Ruskin</span> made the common error of not altering the old yearʼs date”—writing, that is, “<span class="date-1826-01">Jan<sup>y</sup> 
                        1826</span>”, but intending “<span class="date-1827-01">Jan<sup>y</sup> 1827</span>” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 2:255 n. 1).</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Since <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>ʼs reasoning depends on overruling what <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> actually wrote, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs interpretation seems certainly more
                        straightforward and surely at least as convincing—namely, that the date applies to <span class="title-poem-THENEEDLESSALARM">“The Needless Alarm”</span> but not necessarily to all four
                        of the poems preceding the note. While <span class="title-poem-THENEEDLESSALARM">“The Needless Alarm”</span> must have been fair‐copied “about <span class="date-1827-01">Jan<sup>y</sup> 1827</span>”
                        along with the other verse at the end of <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> would have known if <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had composed
                        the poem a year earlier than the others (and if that was the case, she may have remembered the date because <span class="title-poem-THENEEDLESSALARM">“The Needless Alarm”</span> was possibly the
                        first—or first surviving—of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <a href="/notes/new_years_poems_note" target="_self">New Yearʼs Poems</a>;
                        see <a href="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</a>). Moreover, there is another instance of <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs
                        glossing a poem with a date earlier than surrounding poems—<a href="/apparatuses/glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus#DATE" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-GLENOFGLENFARG">“Glen of Glenfarg” (“Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill”)</span></a>,
                        in <a href="/apparatuses/msiii_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a>—and, in that case, <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> accept <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs authority at face value. Finally, it seems
                        implausible that <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> would have written <span class="date-1826">1826</span> for <span class="date-1827">1827</span> without noticing the error, since her note about the date of the whole of
                        <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a> (which is unquestioned) is placed immediately below.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Without following <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> in their argument for dating <span class="title-poem-THENEEDLESSALARM">“The Needless Alarm”</span> some time after

                        that <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> intends “<span class="date-1826-01">Jan<sup>y</sup> 1826</span>” to refer to all four poems preceding her note. This possibility is admitted in dating the other three poems—

                            while he modeled the subject of the poem on the poetry of <a href="/notes/barbauld_anna_laetitia_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-ALB">Anna Letitia Barbauld</span> (<span class="date-1743-1825">1743–1825</span>)</a>,

                            With <span class="persName-WCP">Cowper</span>ʼs poem, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs tale shares a theme of animals being frightened by noises. 
                            While wandering in a field, Cowperʼs solitary observer is surprised by the bray of hounds coursing a fox in a distant hunt. Sheep are panicked by the noise, 
                            but they only run in circles and come near to leaping into a pit. In an imagined exchange between a ram and an ewe, 
                            the ewe cautions the ram against leading the flock into such “despʼrate steps”, for the “darkest day . . . will have passʼd away”, 
                            if one but “live ʼtill tomorrow” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#COWPERPOEMS" target="_self">Cowper, <i>Poems</i>, ed. Baird and Ryskamp</a>, 3:45–49).</div>

                            (<a href="/notes/bibliography#BARBAULDPOEMS" target="_self"><span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>, <span class="title-book-BARBAULDPOEMS"><i>Poems</i></span>, ed. <span class="persName-WMCCARTHY">McCarthy</span> and <span class="persName-EKRAFT">Kraft</span></a>, 36–37, 244–45; and see

                            The mouseʼs appeal for liberty and compassion differs from the moral of prudence taught by <span class="persName-WCP">Cowper</span>ʼs poem, but the ideas are linked 
                            both in the observations of <span class="persName-WCP">Cowper</span>ʼs solitary, who is contemptuous of the fox hunting that “rural gentlmen call sport divine”, 
                            and in the contributions by <span class="persName-ALB">Mrs. Barbauld</span> to <span class="title-lesson-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS-italic"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span> (<span class="date-1792-1796">1792–96</span>),

                            in the prose tale, <span class="title-tale-BARBAULDYOUNGMOUSE">“The Young Mouse: A Fable”</span>, the reader learns about the pleasant life of a young mouse in a house where “nobody had ever hurt her”, 
                            although the mouse fears the cat. One day the young mouse joyfully informs her mother that “the good people of this family have built me a house to live in”, where the mouse and her mother could be safe from the cat; 
                            however, her mother explains that the house her daughter is describing is a trap, and that she must beware of “man [who] has not so fierce a look as a cat”, 
                            but “he is as much our enemy, and has still more cunning” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS" target="_self">Aikin and Barbauld, <i>Evenings at Home</i></a>, 1:19–20). 
                            In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, the prudent mouse believes its “house” of high rushes keeps it safe from its “foe”, 
                            and perhaps it is the wariness of the hen whose scratching scares off the dog—or perhaps the escape is only good fortune. Likewise concerned with the safety of houses is another poem in the
