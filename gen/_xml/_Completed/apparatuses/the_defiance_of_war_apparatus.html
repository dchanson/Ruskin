                        <div class="p">It is possible that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem reflects his parentsʼ memory of an unsettled period during the beginning of their long courtship. 
                            In <span class="date-1803">1803</span>, with the collapse of the <span class="date-1802-03-25">Peace of <span class="placeName-AMIENS">Amiens</span></span> <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span> began to mass troops on the French coast of the <span class="geogName-ENGLISHCHANNEL">English Channel</span> along with 
                            a flotilla of rafts and boats in port cities, ready to carry the invading force across the <span class="geogName-ENGLISHCHANNEL">Channel</span> into <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>. The threat threw the <span class="placeName-UK">United Kingdom</span> 
                            into a state of high alarm, prompting calls to organize, arm, and drill volunteer militias in cities, towns, and villages throughout <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span> and <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>. 
                            During this tense period, which held until <span class="persName-HNVN">Horatio Nelson</span>ʼs victory at <span class="placeName-TRAFALGAR">Trafalgar</span> in <span class="date-1805-10">October 1805</span>, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Cock</span> was living in the <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span> 
                            residence of her uncle on her motherʼs side, <span class="persName-JTR">John Thomas Ruskin</span> (<span class="date-1761-1817">1761–1817</span>), serving as a vital household support to her aunt, <span class="persName-CTWR">Catherine Ruskin</span> (<span class="date-1763-1817">1763–1817</span>). 
                            <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs cousin, <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, had recently set out for <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> in search of a career. In <span class="date-1803">1803</span>, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> was twenty‐two and <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> was eighteen—the

                        <div class="p">In <span class="date-1803-1804">1803–4</span>, the unsettled state of the nation was mirrored by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs uncertainty about his future. In <span class="date-1801">1801</span>, he had gone to <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> with letters of introduction in search of a position, 
                            only to be called back to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> to toil for a druggist in <span class="placeName-FIFE">Fife</span> while awaiting an opening in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>. By <span class="date-1804-1805">1804–5</span>, he had finally gained a position with a <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> merchant firm, 
                            but the firmʼs future was unpromising. An <span class="date-1805">1805</span> letter by his mother suggests a complex tangle of emotions—on his part, a guilty sense of “undutifulness” in leaving home, 
                            combined probably with resentment of his fatherʼs irrational “temper” that apparently wanted him neither in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> nor at home; and on his motherʼs part, self‐recrimination 
                            as a “poor selfish being who for her own gratification”—presumably, in wanting to keep him at home—“would ruin the prospects of her Child and perhaps condemn him to a life of misery forever”. 
                            Now, however, <span class="persName-CTWR">Catherine</span> perceived her duty in propping up her sonʼs “habits of Industry”, “<span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">God</span> requir[ing] that man should be accountable for his time” 
                            and “active in doing good to his fellow Creatures”

                            his conflicted emotions were writ large by British evangelicals whose assurance of <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">God</span>ʼs protection was thrown into question by the prospect of French invasion. 
                            As a correspondent in <span class="placeName-KNARESBOROUGH">Knaresborough, Yorkshire</span>, cautioned readers of the <a href="/notes/evangelical_magazine_note" target="_self"><span class="title-periodical-EVANGELICALMAG"><i>Evangelical Magazine</i></span></a> in <span class="date-1804">1804</span>: 
                            “a supposed confidence in <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">God</span> in the season of apparent security, may not produce all the effects expected, in the hour of difficulty and distress. 
                            It is indeed arguing according to the promise, when we try to persuade ourselves that, ‘As our day is, so shall our strength be’: 
                            but unless we take into the account an habitual concern to please him and to walk with him, such a persuasion will prove presumptuous, 
                            rather than the fruit of a lively active faith, and will leave us in want of the consolation and support we expected”

                        <div class="p">As <span class="persName-RMATLAK">Richard Matlak</span> remarks, this position represents a change of heart in <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span>, as he, <span class="persName-DW">Dorothy</span>, and <span class="persName-STC">S. T. Coleridge</span> 
                            appeared at first to have shunned the summons for militia volunteers by departing home for a tour of <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> in <span class="date-1802-08-1802-09">August–September 1802</span>. 
                            Immediately on their return, however, <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span> signed up with the Grasmere Volunteers, his mind changed, <span class="persName-RMATLAK">Matlak</span> argues, 
                            by a meeting with <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span> during the tour. <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span> was an ardent militarist, and his zeal was answered not just by British countrymen but also by <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> merchants—those 
                            “monied Worldlings” whom <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span> condemns for cowardice, but whom <span class="persName-RMATLAK">Matlak</span> reads as straw men in the poem 
                            (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MATLAKWORDSWORTHANDGREATTERROR" target="_self"><span class="persName-RMATLAK">Matlak</span>, <span class="title-essay-MATLAKWORDSWORTHANDGREATTERROR">“Wordsworth and the ‘Great Terror’ of 1803–05”</span></a>). 
                            The temptation to construct straw men would have been strong in a time when patriotism was feverish, yet some were apt to “taint the air” with “apprehension and despair”—not 
                            because they feared for their riches, but because as evangelicals they read divine retribution into the events. For <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, the conflicting signs must have mirrored 
                            his own despair even of locating a home much less of defending it.</div>

                        <div class="p">Attitudes to invasion were no less conflicted for British women. Children who grew up in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span> during the <span class="date-1799-11-09-1815-06-18">Napoleonic</span> and immediately post‐Napoleonic eras 
                            were exposed to the anxieties of women who, as <span class="persName-LC">Linda Colley</span> remarks, 
                            “seem to have believed that their own security and the security of the family unit were at stake in this

                            In part, this was because the risk of a French invasion of <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span> was so much greater in this war than ever before. 
                            But crucial, too, as an ingredient in female anxiety was the destruction of <span class="persName-MAJ">Marie‐Antoinette</span> and the rest of the French Royal Family”—a regicide that 
                            <span class="persName-EB">Edmund Burke</span>ʼs <span class="title-essay-BURKEREFLECTIONS"><i>Reflections on the Revolution in France</i></span> 
                            (<span class="date-1790">1790</span>) taught the elder Ruskinsʼ generation to stigmatize specifically in terms “of a queen who was also a wife and mother being driven by force from her home”

                            While it is impossible to specify when and with what extent of supervision <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> dipped into this miscellaneous “juvenile budget” 
                            of dialogues, fables, and poems, its anti‐war pieces were vividly prominent. For example, in the dialogue 
                            <span class="title-lesson-BARBAULDTHINGSBYTHEIRRIGHTNAMES">“Things by Their Right Names”</span> (traditionally ascribed to <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>ʼs authorship rather than <span class="persName-JAIKIN">Aikin</span>ʼs), 
                            a Father obliges the wish of his son, Charles, for a story about “bloody murder“; however, 
                            in place of the generic props and characters of romance that Charles anticipates, 
                            the father substitutes unexpected “right names” for elements in the story. 
                            As Charles pieces together these words, he realizes his father is not relating a thriller but describing a battle: 
                            “‘I do not know any <i>murders</i> half so bloody’”, the Father concludes. 
                            Implicit in the fatherʼs lesson is the real threat that war poses to the English home, 
                            as the family has gathered “‘round the fire quite ready to hear”’ a good story, 
                            only to find their expectations invaded by graphic images of violence

                            which uses a strategy similar to that of <span class="title-lesson-BARBAULDTHINGSBYTHEIRRIGHTNAMES">“Things by Their Right Names”</span> of substituting blunt definitions for the evasions of self‐glorifying warriors. 
                            The pretensions of <span class="persName-KA3">Alexander the Great</span> are mocked by a lowly Thracian, who has been captured for stealing. 
                            <span class="persName-KA3">Alexander</span>ʼs conquests, the Thracian explains, are no better than the robberies committed by the captive (2:152–56). Later, 
                            in <span class="title-lesson-BARBAULDTRUEHEROISM">“True Heroism”</span>, the actions of <span class="persName-KA3">Alexander</span> and other alleged heroes are attributed to mere selfishness, while true heroism is bestowed 
                            on a common lad who protects his family from the abuse and neglect of his father—“of all the tyranny and cruelty exercised in the world, 
                            . . . that of bad husbands and fathers [being] by much the most frequent and worst” (5:85–90, 88).</div>

                            opens with a boy bursting into “his fatherʼs house” to proclaim the “glorious news” of “a complete victory”, 
                            only to be cross‐examined by his father. Rationally, the father unpacks the news by weighing the illusory benefits of the victory against its hugely painful costs. 
                            The father closes his case with a story illustrating the sufferings of a soldier, who returns home from battle grotesquely wounded, 
                            and whose death causes the decline of his fiance and parents. Again, the greatest cost of war is pictured as the fall of the peaceful and prosperous home (4:52–63). 
                            In a sequel dialogue, <span class="title-lesson-BARBAULDCOSTOFAWAR">“The Cost of a War”</span>, the father describes the notorious destruction of the <span class="placeName-PALATINATE">German Palatinate</span> by <span class="persName-KL14">Louis XIV</span> of <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span> 
                            to reveal the effects of imperial aggression on unoffending villagers whose homes and crops are burned (5:54–63; and see,

                            during the <span class="date-1789-05-05-1799-11-09">Revolutionary period</span>. The language for the childrenʼs lessons is simpler, and their ironies less biting than what <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span> indulged in her anti‐war political pamphlets. 
                            The simplicity, however, potentially increased the risk of censure for sedition during the height of the governmentʼs alarm in the <span class="date-1790-1799">1790s</span>, 
                            since the arguments could be construed as leading unsophisticated folk astray

                            Certainly, <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>ʼs mastery of a shared Radical discourse drew censure because her rhetoric was indistinguishable from that of male writers. 
                            In her own time, she was accused of having “unsexed” herself. Famously, <span class="persName-JWCROKER">John Wilson Croker</span> attacked her in his review of her poem,

                            “wander[ing] from the course in which she was respectable and useful”—as an educator and writer for children—and 
                            mistaking “her power and her duty” as a “lady‐author” by presuming to comment on the affairs of empire ().

                            the book was initially well received primarily among liberal Dissenter families. The book proved objectionable to Anglican Evangelical readers, 
                            but primarily for what it did not say, such as connecting scientific topics explicitly with religious commentary. 
                            In any case, controversy had waned by the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>, 
                            when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> encountered the work, and <span class="title-lesson-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span> achieved the status of a classic,

                            <span class="persName-JAIKIN">Aikin</span> and <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span> may also have steered clear of sedition by confining the anti‐war pieces to historical examples—the ancient <span class="placeName-MACEDONIA">Macedonia</span> 
                            of <span class="persName-KA3">Alexander the Great</span>, the seventeenth‐century <span class="geogName-EUROPE">Europe</span> of <span class="persName-KL14">Louis XIV</span>. However the implications of the anti‐war arguments were apprently muted for most readers, just as 
                            in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="title-poem-JRTHEDEFIANCEOFWAR">“The Defiance of War”</span> <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span> and <span class="persName-JAIKIN">Aikin</span>ʼs discourse appears largely ignored in details. One can perhaps glimpse the Radical contention 
                            that only the ruling class benefits by war in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs remark that war “like[s] better a king to be”. Overwhelmingly, however, 
                            the poemʼs pacifist message is not only unsupported by argument but even contradicted by a discordant militarism, such as the threat 
                            that any invading army “here shall suffering die”. Moreover, the gender positioning seems aggressively masculine, 
                            with the promise that war will in its turn be conquered by “he” who is “the strongest of us”—presumably referring to the patriarch of the household, 
                            or to a military hero of the nation.</div>

                            whether “fields of carnage, days of toil, [can] destroy / The lovʼd impressions of domestic joy?” (lines 111–14), she still insists 
                            that home is an “ark of refuge” and a “fane of rest [that] <i>no</i> raging storms invade” (lines 76, 61). 
                            Triumphantly, the poem asserts the “mystic power” of domestic affections (line 252) to overcome all trials of adversity, 
                            just as domestic joy will outlast any competing sources of joy such as fame and genius. 
                            Doubt emerges only when evocation of “maternal love” prompts the question of “who may charm <i>her</i> sleepless pang to rest” (lines 341, 343)

                            Soon thereafter, in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> in <span class="date-1816">1816</span>, the Peace Society was founded as a coalition of Quakers and other Dissenters,

                            between reactionary state policies and republican movements, the Peace Society advocated nonintervention. It finally found a political platform

                            As it turned out, <span class="placeName-RUSSIA">Russia</span> continued to press hostilities in the name of the Greek cause, and <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span> joined <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span> and <span class="placeName-RUSSIA">Russia</span> to declare
