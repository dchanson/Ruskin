                        earlier, however, in the <span class="date-1826-01-1826-06">first half of 1826</span>; or later, through <span class="date-1827-02-21-1827-06-01">spring 1827</span>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">This poem, as well as <a href="/apparatuses/on_the_rainbow_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-ONTHERAINBOW">“On the Rainbow: In Blank Verse”</span></a> 
                        which follows it in <a href="/apparatuses/msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-anthology-MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">“Poetry” [MS I Poetry Anthology]</span></a>,
                        most likely belong to <span class="date-1827-01-1827-02">January or February 1827</span>. The two poems follow
                        <a href="/notes/ruskin_margaret_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs note</a>
                        dating the whole of <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self">MS I</a> as finished “about <span class="date-1827-01">Jan<sup>y</sup> 1827</span>” 
                        (see <a href="/apparatuses/the_needless_alarm_apparatus#DATE" target="_self">“The Needless Alarm”: Date</a>).
                        Following <a href="/apparatuses/on_the_rainbow_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-ONTHERAINBOW">“On the Rainbow: In Blank Verse”</span></a>, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrote “The end / hernhill / fountain street / <span class="del-scratchout">end of the poems</span> / juvenile library fountain street.”
                        This colophon seems to correspond with <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs note, “this book. . . finished,” especially since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> (or a parent?) struck through
                        “end of the poems,” perhaps to emphasize the conclusion of the volume, not just of 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-anthology-MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">“Poetry” [MS I Poetry Anthology]</span></a>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">The apparent correspondence between the colophon and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs note nonetheless leaves an opening on the question of dating. On the one hand, one
                        can imagine <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> writing the colophon before <span class="persName-MR">his mother</span> entered her date for the manuscript. (She might have jotted her note where she did, 
                        between <span class="title-poem-JRONPAPASLEAVINGHOME">“On Papaʼs Leaving Home”</span> and the preceding poem, 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/the_needless_alarm_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-THENEEDLESSALARM">“The Needless Alarm”</span></a>, because that was the only space available.) On the
                        other hand, one can imagine <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> returning to <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a> to add two more poems along with the colophon, 
                        after <span class="persName-MR">his mother</span> had notated the booklet as being finished.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">If the latter is the case—and one notices that <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs note takes up a significant amount of space without crowding, as if nothing at the
                        time obstructed her in writing the note—then <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have composed <span class="title-poem-JRONPAPASLEAVINGHOME">“On Papaʼs Leaving Home”</span> 
                        around <span class="date-1827-02-21">21 February 1827</span>, when <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> sent a <a href="/apparatuses/jjr_to_mr_1827-02-21_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter</span></a> as despondent with homesickness as his
                        sonʼs poem is filled with longing (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 151–52). 
                        About a week earlier, this same journey may also have prompted <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs composition of 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/look_at_that_ship_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHESHIP1827">“The Ship” <i>and</i> “Look at That Ship” [1827]</span></a>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">This interpretation of the final two poems of <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>
                        <span class="title-poem-JRONPAPASLEAVINGHOME">“On Papaʼs Leaving Home”</span> and <span class="title-poem-ONTHERAINBOW">“On the Rainbow: In Blank Verse”</span>, 
                        seems supported not only by what precedes them in the anthology but also by what probably immediately followed
                        them chronologically—<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs “<span class="date-1827-02-1827-03"><span class="sic">febuary [sic]</span> or march 1827</span>” dating of the 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/msxi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span></a> fair copy of 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/look_at_that_ship_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-THESHIP1827">“The Ship” <i>and</i> “Look at that Ship” [1827]</span></a> 
                        (see <a href="/apparatuses/look_at_that_ship_apparatus#DATE" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-THESHIP1827">“The Ship” <i>and</i> “Look at that Ship”[1827]</span>: Date</a>).
                        It is worth noting, too, that, if <span class="title-poem-JRONPAPASLEAVINGHOME">“On Papaʼs Leaving Home”</span> and
                        <a href="/apparatuses/on_the_rainbow_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-ONTHERAINBOW">“On the Rainbow: In Blank Verse”</span></a> 
                        are regarded as fair‐copied in <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a> 
                        at about the same time in <span class="date-1827-02-21-1827-03">late February or March 1827</span>, it is logical that 
                        <span class="title-poem-ONTHERAINBOW">“On the Rainbow: In Blank Verse”</span> shares its subtitle
                        with <a href="/apparatuses/time_blank_verse_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTIMEBLANKVERSE">“Time: Blank Verse”</span></a>, 
                        composed for <span class="date-1827-01-01">New Yearʼs Day 1827</span>. There is also a convergence of these items with the drawing on the inside of the back endboard of 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>, 
                        <a href="/figures/heights_of_wisdom_drawing_msi" target="_self">“Heights of Wisdom, Depth of Fools”</a>, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        dated <span class="date-1827-03-21">21 March</span> (provided that date refers to <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, and not <span class="date-1826">1826</span>).</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Despite this strong concatenation of evidence, one must acknowledge the possibilities of both earlier and later dates for 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRONPAPASLEAVINGHOME">“On Papaʼs Leaving Home”</span>. 
                        As a case for a later date, if <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> added the final two poems in the anthology following when 
                        <span class="persName-MR">his mother</span> wrote her note dating 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>, then nothing
                        prevents his having done so considerably later in <span class="date-1827">1827</span> than within the first two months. 
                        However, by <span class="date-1827-04-28">April 28</span>, he was writing with pen and ink, and it seems unlikely that he would return to a pencil manuscript 
                        (see <a href="/apparatuses/wales_apparatus#DATE" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-WALES">“Wales”</span>: Date</a>,

                        <a href="/notes/hand_note" target="_self">Ruskinʼs Handwriting</a>). Moreover, by the 
                        <span class="date-1827-07-1827-12">second half of 1827</span>,
                        he was working on a new <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self">Red Book</a>,
                        <a href="/apparatuses/msiii_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a>, and it seems likely the new project 
                        would have deflected his attention from <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">An earlier date for <span class="title-poem-JRONPAPASLEAVINGHOME">“On Papaʼs Leaving Home”</span> must be kept open as a possibility for the same reason that all

                        must be viewed as having possibly been composed as much as year prior to their fair‐copying (see

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> perhaps refers to the subject of pictures that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> may have brought home—prints of peasants, for example, in colorful costumes in

                        “sombre evenings” when he was away, times when he wrote to <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> about “a real sadness & sigh[ing] like a child after the Joys of my
                        home” (<a href="/apparatuses/jjr_to_mr_1826-03-09_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter of <span class="date-1826-03-09">9 March 1826</span></span></a> [<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 134]).
                        In <span class="date-1826">1826</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> was particularly prone to depression over slow business and the consequent necessity for protracted travel
                        for orders. At home, owing to his long absences, “every thing” was “unsettled and uncomfortable”; and painful longing afflicted even
                        the servants, according to <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> (<a href="/apparatuses/mr_to_jjr_1826-05-25_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter of <span class="date-1826-05-25">25 May 1826</span></span></a> [<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 148]).</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">At this time, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> was distraught also over the death of his nephew, <a href="/notes/richardson_james_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-JRPSON">James Richardson</span></a>, whom he had
                        employed in his firm, and he confessed to being troubled by guilt that his stewardship might even have had something “to do with this disorder” (<a href="/apparatuses/mr_to_jjr_1826-05-07_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter of <span class="date-1826-05-08">8 May 1826</span></span></a> 
                        [<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 140]). In fact, if <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composed
                        this poem as late as <span class="date-1813-04-1826-05">April–May 1826</span>, its tone may refer specifically both to <span class="persName-JJR">his father</span>ʼs solemn letters and to his own “forsaken”
                        feeling of “No papa no James” (<a href="/apparatuses/mr_to_jjr_1826-05-07_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter of <span class="date-1826-05-07">7 May 1826</span></span></a> [<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 141]).</div>
