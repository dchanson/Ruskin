                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> entitled the second anthology <span class="title-anthology-">“<span class="caps">Poetry</span>”</span>, just as he had entitled an earlier anthology 
                        in <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>,

                        as <span class="title-anthology-">“Poetry”</span>. The arrangement of poems in <span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“Poetry Discriptive”</span> suggests that 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was conscious of this group meriting the distinction of a more thematically grouped, less miscellaneous anthology.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">Other than harkening to the picturesque tradition, a source for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs title is unidentified. While not providing an exact match, 
                        a possible inspiration may have been prompted by the titles that <span class="persName-WW">William Wordsworth</span> assigned to groups of his poems, 
                        as he first categorized them for <span class="title-book-WORDSWORTHPOEMS2VOLS"><i>Poems, in Two Volumes</i></span> 
                        (<span class="date-1807">1807</span>), but as became known to the Ruskins in the five‐volume <span class="title-book-WORDSWORTHPOETICALWORKS"><i>Poetical Works</i></span> 
                        (<span class="date-1827">1827</span>). Since <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> acquired “Wordsworth” in <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, during or before <span class="date-1827-06">June</span> of that year—an acquisition that has been assumed 
                        to consist at least in part of this five‐volume set—the purchase was timely for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs naming of his small anthology. While none of <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span>ʼs titles 
                        for his subdivisions reflect the inverted noun‐modifier of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs title, or even contain the term <i>descriptive</i>, 
                        it is suggestive that <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span> categorized his early picturesque excursion poem, <span class="title-poem-WORDSWORTHDESCRIPTIVESKETCHES">“Descriptive Sketches”</span>, 
                        among his <span class="title-anthology-WORDSWORTHJUVENILE">“Juvenile Pieces”</span>—a group that might have caught <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs eye.</div>

                        which he added belatedly to the bottom of the list of “Sundries” for <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, already completed and totaled up for the year. The group may or may not be

                        and his cousins lived. The latest time when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> is likely to have worked on the anthology is

                        <span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“Poetry Discriptive”</span> is perhaps more closely associated with

                        in terms both of theme and of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs 
                        bookmaking, than with the later two anthologies in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>. The sequence of forming the anthologies explains why 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> placed <span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“Poetry Discriptive”</span> many pages 
                        into the <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self">Red Book</a>, surrounded by what would at that point have been blank pages, 
                        since he thereby left room at the start of the notebook for ongoing composition of 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol2_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-lesson-HARRYANDLUCYVOL2">“Harry and Lucy,” Vol. 2</span></a>,
                        and he possibly allowed space following <span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“Poetry Discriptive”</span> for expansion of the anthology itself. 
                        Had <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> extended 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol2_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-lesson-HARRYANDLUCYVOL2">“Harry and Lucy,” Vol. 2</span></a>, to fill 
                        the intervening pages up to the start of the poetry anthology—and there survive artifacts of this intention in the drawings scattered throughout these pages, 
                        which appear related to the prose lesson, and which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> probably meant originally to surround with this text—and had he extended 
                        the poetry anthology to the end of the notebook, the overall arrangement would have closely resembled the contents of 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>. (As it turned out, in
                        <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not extend either 
                        <span class="title-lesson-HARRYANDLUCYVOL2">“Harry and Lucy”</span> or <span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“Poetry Discriptive”</span> 
                        to such a length, and over time he made the contents of <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> more miscellaneous by adding, among other things, 
                        the other two poetry anthologies in remaining blank pages. See <a href="/apparatuses/msiii_apparatus#DISCUSSION" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>: Discussion</a>.)</div>

                        A more salient organization of this poetic picturesque tour is a move from specifically architectural and historical interest in the first two poems to the
                        topographical observations in the remaining poems. In this view of the collection, a poem as seemingly minor (if also clever) as
                        <a href="/apparatuses/nature_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-NATURE">“Nature”</span></a> works as a hinge between the two groups,

                        As the travel writer, poet, and physician, <span class="persName-WB">William Beattie</span> (<span class="date-1793-1875">1793–1875</span>) wrote 
                        in <span class="date-1838">1838</span>, <span class="placeName-PERTHSHIRE">Perthshire</span> was
                        “proverbial as the favoured province in which Nature has been prodigal of her gifts” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#SCOTLANDILLUSTRATED" target="_self"><span class="persName-WB">Beattie</span>, <span class="title-artwork-SCOTLANDILLUSTRATED"><i>Scotland Illustrated</i></span></a>, 2:1). 
                        Whereas for <span class="persName-WB">Beattie</span> <span class="placeName-PERTHSHIRE">Perthshire</span> opens up nature in the form of the sublime, however, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="placeName-PERTHSHIRE">Perthshire</span> is domestic and accessible. 
                        <span class="persName-WB">Beattie</span> ascends from the tropes of “the magnificence of Nature and the primitive simplicity of the inhabitants” 
                        to the trope of the Highlandersʼ unconquered liberty (<a href="/notes/bibliography#SCOTLANDILLUSTRATED" target="_self">Beattie, <span class="title-artwork-SCOTLANDILLUSTRATED"><i>Scotland Illustrated</i></span></a>, 2:1–2; 
                        and see <a href="/notes/bibliography#TOURISMANDIDENTITY" target="_self">Grenier, <i>Tourism and Identity in Scotland</i></a>, 20). 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, however, ignores the grandeur of the <span class="geogName-GRAMPIANS">Grampians</span> in favor of the more homely
