                        the title serves for what read as two distinct versions of this poem, rather than as two strophes of a single poem. 
                        The two parts do not appear to form a single work in the usual sense (see

                        but only drew a line between the strophes. Rather, the second part or strophe seems to start the poem anew, as if as a second version; the two parts 
                        are designated editorially as (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>).</div>

                     <div class="p">Two strophes on the subject of a storm appear in succession, separated by a 
                        horizontal line. Such lines separate the stanzas also in 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-GLENOFGLENFARG">“Glen of Glenfarg” (“Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill”)</span></a>, 
                        another poem in <a href="/apparatuses/poetry_discriptive_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“Poetry Discriptive”</span></a>, 
                        but in that case the stanzas clearly flow continuously from one to the next. In <span class="title-poem-THESTORM">“The storm”</span>, 
                        strophe (<i>b</i>) appears to start the poem anew and revise (<i>a</i>); and as an indication that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        meant strophe (<i>b</i>) to replace (<i>a</i>), he wrote the word 
                        “bad” on the same line as the runover of the final line of (<i>a</i>), as if declaring that strophe rejected. Little
                        time appears to have elapsed between this decision and the composition of (<i>b</i>), the
                        hand remaining consistent; and the immediacy of this revision perhaps explains why <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not repeat the title, 
                        as if considering the original title to remain in play.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">While the meaning of <i>bad</i> may be open to interpretation, I have marked it as a metamark—not a part of the poem 
                        itself, but as disapproving comment on strophe (<i>a</i>),
                        prompting the composition of (<i>b</i>) as a replacement. The most obvious evidence
                        for this interpretation is that the runover line becomes jibberish (“light bad nings”) if one treats <i>bad</i> as part of the line itself. 
                        Other evidence for treating the word as a separable metamark is the
                        physical alignment of the runovers of the final two lines, which, if  is omitted, appears in keeping with that of other poems
                        in the anthology.</div>

                     <div class="p">If <i>bad</i> is read as a judgment on strophe (<i>a</i>),
                        one quality that may explain the rejection is the violence of the woman’s
                        death in that version of the poem. In other very early work, there is evidence of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs avoiding expression of 
                        violence. For example, among <a href="/notes/boyhood_books_note" target="_self">Ruskinʼs boyhood books</a> is his copy of 
                        <a href="/notes/bibliography#DAYHISTORY" target="_self"><span class="title-novel-DAYHISTORY-italic">The History of Little Jack</span></a> 
                        (<span class="date-1820">1820</span>) by <a href="/notes/day_thomas_note" target="_self">Thomas Day (1748–89)</a>
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY" target="_self">Dearden, <i>Library of John Ruskin</i></a>, no. 690), 
                        in which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> traced outlines of the scenes depicted in the plates, using the platesʼ blank versos—all of the plates, 
                        that is, except one that depicts two boys fighting. Another early example of apprehension of conflict is the poem,
