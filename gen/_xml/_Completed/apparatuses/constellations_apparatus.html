                  <span class="head-section">Title</span>
                  
                  <div class="p">In the earlier of two surviving fair copies of the poem (see <a href="#MAJORMS">Manuscripts</a>), 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/rft70_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span></a>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> centered 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“<span class="caps">THE CONSTELLATIONS</span>”</span> above the column of lines. 
                        Then, in what appears an afterthought, he added “<span class="caps">NORTHERN</span>” to the right in the margin, on the baseline of the main title; 
                        and on a second line below “<span class="caps">NORTHERN</span>”, he placed, awkwardly, in the margin to the right of the opening lines of the poem, 
                        “<span class="caps">SOME OF THE ZODIAC / AND SOME OF THE SOUTHERN</span>”.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">While the addition of the trailing lines to the first fair‐copy subtitle might be explained as pacing <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs composition of the poem—that is, 
                        his elaboration of the subtitle as he added constellations from across the hemispheres—this 
                        possibility conflicts with the existence of a prior draft. The belated additions could suggest, however, that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> came to understand the hemispheric positions of the constellations only after he first drafted the poem. 
                        As discussed in <a href="#STAGE">“The Constellations” as Marking a Stage of Astronomical Education</a>, this inference is probably too extreme—contradicted, for example, 
                        by his clustering, more or less, of constellation groups within the poem, such as the northern circumpolar constellations and the <span class="name--ZODIAC">Zodiac</span> constellations. Nonetheless, 
                        the evolving title does testify broadly to <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span> as a marker of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs developing understanding and his desire to represent that development textually and materially. 
                        The revision to the title may also have posed one motive for giving up on this fair‐copy manuscript, 
                        <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span>, and using the same sheet to revise some of its lines (see <a href="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</a>).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">In the second surviving fair copy, in <a href="/apparatuses/msiii_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a>, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> incorporated his revisions to the first fair copy, including 
                        allowing space to center the subtitle properly below the main title and above the first line, breaking the three lines as 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“<span class="caps">THE CONSTELLATIONS / NORTHERN, SOME OF THE ZODIAC AND / SOME OF THE SOUTHERN</span>”</span>.</div>

                        lacks a title. Since the (unnumbered) lines in this manuscript start with line 27 as fair‐copied, 
                        presumably a sheet containing draft of preceding lines has been lost, which may have included a title. The first state of the title, if any, is therefore unknown, 
                        and we can only speculate about its relation to the apparent expansion of the subtitle in the first fair copy.

                            This identification is mistaken: the folded sheet of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“Constellations”</span> draft has been collected together with a fragment of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“Monastery”</span> draft, 
                            which resembles the former in its paper and pencil cursive hand, and the collection misidentified as consisting solely of manuscript of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span>. 
                            The two projects were closely aligned, however; see <a href="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</a>.</div>

                     <div class="p">A facsimile of a manuscript—the whereabouts of the original being unknown—this item consists of two photographs, which document a vertically folded sheet 
                            containing a fair copy of the poem in pen‐and‐ink print lettering in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs hand, along with revisions of the text in his cursive hand, both ink and pencil. 
                            The first‐stage fair copy was annotated in pencil by <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>.
                            Possibly, the photographs were taken in the course of preparing the 
                            <a href="/notes/library_edition_note" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span></a>; if so, 
                            the facsimile was not cited or reproduced in the edition. The photographs are held by The Ruskin at Lancaster University, 
                            catalogued as <a href="/apparatuses/rft70_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span></a>.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">The folded sheet was photographed spread open and laid flat, with one photograph showing pages 4 and 1 (from left to right), 
                            and the other photograph showing the reverse side, pages 2 and 3 (from left to right). The manuscript reveals at least two major stages of composition, 
                            a first stage of fair copying, and a second stage of heavy revision. The fair copy occupies pages 1–2 (i.e., both sides of the first leaf), 
                            while the remaining pages 3–4 (the second leaf) would originally have been left blank, prior to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs revisions. 
                            Subsequently, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> used this blank space, as well as the margins of pages 1–2, for revisions. 
                            Thus, the facsimiles preserve a rare instance of a manuscript containing a fair copy of an early work by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> that he subsequently revised using the same sheet.</div>

                        although they leave the nature of this association unexplained

                  <div class="p">The physical basis for associating the two poems is the similarity of the fragments of rough draft in a pencil, cursive hand—so similar that the two drafts 
                        were apparently mistaken as belonging to the same work (see <a href="/apparatuses/msia_apparatus#COLLATION" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>: Collation of the Original Manuscript</a> and

                        Here it suffices to explain that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs hand in these draft manuscripts, which is a sprawling cursive in pencil with occasional substitutions in pen‐and‐ink cursive, 
                        cannot be earlier than his first use of pen and ink in <span class="date-1827-04">April 1827</span>; and that the compositional history of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span> 
                        places its <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> draft fragment, which contains lines of book 2 of the poem, no earlier than <span class="date-1827-08">August 1827</span> and possibly starting as late as <span class="date-1827-11">November 1827</span>, 
                        following the familyʼs return to <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> from the <a href="/notes/tours_of_1826-27_note" target="_self"><span class="date-1827">Tour of 1827</span></a> to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>

                  <div class="p">As another physical feature besides the similarity of the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> rough drafts linking <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span> chronologically 
                        with the composition of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span>, the first fair copy of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span> 
                        (<span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span>) shares orthographic eccentricities of punctuation with the fair copy of books 1–2 of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span> 
                        (<span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>). For the first twenty lines of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span>, each line ends with punctuation, occasionally a colon or full‐stop period, 
                        but most frequently a prominent comma formed to look like book print, with a dot and a curl. After twenty lines of this observant punctuation, the marks abruptly stop. 
                        This pattern is identical to the punctuation in the fair copy of book 1 and the first eighty lines of book 2 of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span>, 
                        in which almost every line of verse ends with a punctuation mark until the punctuation gives out altogether. The pattern suggests that 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have added the punctuation to these poems all at once, layering the marks over top of the already fair‐copied text, only to grow tired of the exercise and quit. 
                        Thereafter, in the fair copies of both poems, only an occasional punctuation mark internal to a verse line appears—a comma or an apostrophe, which is regularly spaced along with the surrounding characters, 
                        indicating that the mark was inserted in the course of fair‐copying. Moreover, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs penmanship for the punctuation is similar in the two poemsʼ fair copies, 
                        with the marks at the ends of lines of verse tending to float above the baseline (see <a href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-COMPARISON">Relation to Fair Copy of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span></a>).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">These practices contrast markedly with the very sparse punctuation in the fragmentary rough drafts of both <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span> 
                        and <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span> in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> and with the fair‐copied poems comprising the anthology,

                        The poems in the latter collection exhibit, moreover, an awkward learnerʼs stage of penmanship, including tracing in ink over top of characters formed initially with pencil. 
                        These factors put distance between the <span class="date-1827">1827</span> <span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“poetry discriptive”</span> and the fair copies of 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span> and <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span>, 
                        which in the eccentricity of their punctuation resemble the usage in <a href="/apparatuses/eudosia_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">“Eudosia”</span></a> 
                        (<a href="/apparatuses/msiv_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span></a>), which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> dated <span class="date-1828-09-28">28 September 1828</span> on its title page. 
                        While the significance of that date within the compositional history of <span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">“Eudosia”</span> is obscure, 
                        the triangulation of that projectʼs punctuation practices with those of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span> and 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span> appears to situate the latter two projects decisively in <span class="date-1828">1828</span>.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">But when in <span class="date-1828">1828</span>? If <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> based the first lines of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span> on actual observation of the sky 
                        (or perhaps a demonstration at one of the so‐called Lenten astronomy lectures [see <a href="/notes/astronomy_note" target="_self">Astronomical Education</a>), the alignment of planets and constellations described at the beginning of the poem would have been observable 
                        in <span class="date-1828-04-1828-05">April–May 1828</span>, and not at all observable in <span class="date-1827">1827</span> 
                        (see <a href="#REAL-LIFE">Discussion: “The Constellations” as a Record of Actual Astronomical Observations</a>). This approximate dating would place draft and first fair‐copying of both 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span> and books 1–2 of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span> 
                        in the <span class="date-1828-01-1828-03">first quarter of 1828</span>—between the <a href="/notes/tours_of_1826-27_note" target="_self"><span class="date-1827">Tour of 1827</span></a>, 
                        which had been delayed until late in the year, and the <a href="/" target="_self">Tour of <span class="date-1828">1828</span></a>, probably begun following <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="date-1828-05-10">10 May</span> birthday but interrupted 
                        that same month by news of the death of <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>ʼs sister, <a href="/notes/richardson_jessie_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-JRP">Jessie</span></a>.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Fair‐copying, and possibly initial composition, during the first months of <span class="date-1828">1828</span> accord well with the placement of the second fair copy of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span>, 
                        which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> entered in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> as the first poem in the <a href="/apparatuses/msiii_poetry_anthology_2_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-anthology-MSIIIPOETRYANTHOLOGY2">MS III Second Poetry Anthology</span></a>,

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would not have waited long to make a fair copy incorporating the extensive revisions to the first fair copy of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span> 
                        (see <a href="COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY">Composition and Publication: First Fair Copy [<span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span>]</a>); 
                        and by juxtaposing that poem as the first in the anthology with the end of the second volume of <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL2">“Harry and Lucy”</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> emphasized astronomical learning as a shared interest in both the poem and the prose tale. 
                        In the tale, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span> gives <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> 
                        a drawing of the constellation <span class="name--CHARLESSWAIN">Charlesʼs Wain</span> “as an introduction to astronomy” (p. 7). 
                        Moreover, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> maintained the astronomical theme in the poetry anthology by following <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span> with a fair copy of <a href="/apparatuses/the_sun_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHESUN">“The Sun”</span></a>, 
                        which he composed for <span class="date-1828-01-01">New Yearʼs, 1 January 1828</span>. That <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs orthographic and punctuation practices appear to have progressed little by the time he composed and fair‐copied <span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">“Eudosia”</span> several months later—the same kind of catalog poem on a grandiose scale, 
                        fair‐copied with the same kind or orthographic eccentricities and even weirder punctuation—can be attributed to a long period of family mourning for the death of his aunt. 
                        His father would have been preoccupied at home and in <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>, making arrangements for his sisterʼs estate and orphaned children.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Remaining open to question is whether composition of the initial draft of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span> could have begun as early as a date in 
                        <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, as <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> supposed. 
                        A factor that might argue for confining composition to the <span class="date-1828-01-01-1828-04-30">first quarter of 1828</span>  
                        is the possibility—admittedly questionable—that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> based his opening lines on planetariy observations that were visible in the sky over <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> only during those months, 
                        and not in <span class="date-1827">1827</span>. Those details, which survive in the opening lines of the poem as fair‐copied, are missing along with the first page(s) of draft from the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> manuscript. 
                        Thus, a genesis of the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> draft commencing, say, in <span class="date-1827-10-1827-12">the fourth quarter of 1827</span> can neither be ruled out nor confirmed.</div>

                        <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span> represent a significant advance, which sprang from learning to use pen and ink in <span class="date-1827-04">April 1827</span> 
                        (see <a href="/notes/hand_note" target="_self">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</a>). For the first time, we see preserved draft containing deletions, substitutions, and insertions, both in pencil and in ink, 
                        most of them in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs hand. At least one of the interventions is in the hand of <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>, 
                        but this is limited to correcting a mistranscription from the preceding draft. <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> proofread; she did not herself revise <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs text, unless she did so verbally.

                        by marking text she deemed inappropriate in some way. Thus, these states of text open a window onto <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs compositional process as an interaction with his audience, 
                        his parents—with his mother acting as proofreader and, to a limited extent, as editor. Perhaps these states of draft and fair copy were preserved for this reason,

                        <div class="p">The hand is recognizably <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs cursive, identical to the cursive hand in his holograph <a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1827-05_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-jr_to_jjr_1827-05"><span class="date-1827-05">May 1827</span> letter to his father</span></a>. 
                            The latter document—the earliest surviving example of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs use of pen and ink—is composed almost entirely in cursive using a pencil, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> exchanging the pencil for pen and ink only for the closing of the letter, which he also wrote in cursive. 
                            In the letter, he continued beyond his signature by appending two poems, still using a pen but switching to print lettering. Similarly here, at the end of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span> draft, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> switches from pencil to pen and ink for a closing, “I end”, written in cursive. 
                            Perhaps he reserved pen and ink for closings in these early cursive manuscripts because the ink suggested to him a sense of finality.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">In this draft version of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span>, 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> also uses pen and ink for a few minor revisions, making substitutions in ink by striking through pencil draft with a pen and writing the substituted word above. 
                            This usage, too, may have suggested finality to him, an act of polishing the verse. Alternatively or additionally—and one suspects this also to have been the case in the <span class="title-letter-jr_to_jjr_1827-05"><span class="date-1827">1827</span> letter</span>—<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            felt more at ease manually in dipping a pen to form the strokes of print letters as compared with maintaining the flow of cursive. With respect to penmanship, then, 
                            the constrained use of pen and ink in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIACONSTELLATIONS"><span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“<span class="name--CEPHEUSCONSTELLATION">cepheus</span> and <span class="name--BOOTES">bootes</span> now”</span></span> 
                            represents an earlier developmental stage, comparable to the <span class="title-letter-jr_to_jjr_1827-05"><span class="date-1827">1827</span> letter to his father</span>, 
                                whereas the first fair copy, <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span>, shows him using a pen not only for extensive print‐lettering but also for longer cursive phrases, albeit sometimes over top of the same phrases in pencil, so far as one can tell from the photograph.</div>

                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> appears to have ended the poem twice in draft. At the bottom of the inside recto page of the folded sheet (2r), 
                            he wrote “end” in pencil, cursive; and on the same line, to the left, he wrote “I end” in ink, also cursive—the ink <i>end</i> being presumably the second of the two, 
                            though the order cannot be distinguished from the material evidence. This <i>finis</i> follows <span class="name--CAPRICORNUS">Capricornus (the Sea Goat)</span>, 
                            the last‐listed of the constellations in all three manuscript versions (line 64 in the second fair copy, <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>): 
                            “and the <span class="name--CAPRICORNUS">goat</span> that is formed in the arched sky“. 
                            In draft as well as fair copy, this line carries lexical markers of closure—for one, by beginning the line uniquely with <i>and</i>, as if to say, 
                            <i>and finally</i>; and for another, by ending the line with a flourish supplied by the quaintly poetic modifier <i>arched</i> (for sources of this poetic diction, see the contextual gloss for <i>arched sky</i> in the witnesses).</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">Another ending is found on the back of the folded sheet (2v), where <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> added nine lines beyond the ending at the foot of the preceding page (2r). 
                            Below these nine addtional lines, on a separate line by itself, he again wrote “I end” in pencil longhand; 
                            and to the right of that <i>finis</i>, he wrote “I end” in ink longhand. 
                            (Again, presumably the phrase written in ink was subsequent to the pencil phrase, but the evidence is indeterminate.) 
                            These nine lines form the peroration of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span> as fair‐copied in <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span>.</div> 
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">As originally concluded, therefore, if the “I end” on 2r truly indicates an earlier intention,

                            represented a less ambitious work poetically, aiming solely at a catalogue of stars without any summary reflection on its meaning. 
                            In this respect, the first version of the poem resembles lists of constellations that could be found in print sources on astronomy aimed specifically at children, such as

                            although even <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs lists include implicit commentary in the form of Bible verses 
                                (see <a href="/notes/astronomy_note#PRINTSOURCES-PRIMERS" target="_self">Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children</a>). <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs chief original contribution to such elementary lists consists in his epithets describing some of the constellations he names. 
                            The version of the poem ending with <span class="name--CAPRICORNUS">Capricornus</span> is an aesthetic, poetic exercise more than a religious or scientific one.</div>

                            The two poemsʼ drafts resemble one another in the size and kind of paper used for the physical document, and in the sprawling cursive hand used for the pencil draft.

                            in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>—namely, the anthology <a href="/apparatuses/poetry_discriptive_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“poetry discriptive”</span></a>, which dates from earlier in <span class="date-1827">1827</span>—or 
                            with the continuing fair copy of books 3–4 of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span>, which is set apart from books 1–2 in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> 
                            (see <a href="/apparatuses/monastery_apparatus#COMPPUB1" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span>: Composition and Publication—Stage One of Composition</a>). 
                            For both <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span>, books 1–2, and the first fair copy of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span>, 
                            <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> adopted a comparatively miniscule print‐lettering, resembling a serif typeface.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">Moreover, in the <span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">“poetry discriptive”</span> poems from earlier in <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> avoided punctuation almost entirely, 
                                whereas punctuation does characterize the fair copies of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span> and <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span>, books 1–2. 
                                In both, moreover. the punctuation marks share eccentricities suggesting a learner who has an uncertain grasp of the grammatical and rhetorical function of punctuation but who is excited—at least initially—by 
                            the physical appearance of the marks on the page. Almost every line of books 1–2 of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span> is punctuated, 
                                regardless of grammatical or rhetorical need, and the marks are used exclusively at the ends of lines. This obsessive but misinformed observance abruptly ceases at book 2, line 80, of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span>, at the top of page 79 of the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> fair copy. 
                            Just so, the end of every line of the <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span> <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“Constellations”</span> fair copy is notched with a punctuation mark until line 20, 
                            where the practice abruptly stops.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">Where used, the punctuation in the opening lines of both fair‐copied poems often seems arbitrary. While the full‐stop periods make grammatical sense in most instances, 
                            the commas, colons, and (most prominently in <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span>) an upside‐down semicolon seem interchangeable with one another in their rhetorical use and placement. 
                            Both these fair copies give the impression that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> layered over the texts 
                            with bookish punctuation to convey the appearance of print, without understanding the grammatical and rhetorical function of the marks. 
                            Finally, in both fair copies, the punctuation markup stops abruptly at an arbitrary place, 
                            suggesting that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> grew tired of the exercise, ran out of time, or was informed about his erroneous usage.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">The oddities of punctuation, then, in both manuscripts should be classed with other attempts to give the fair copy an appearance of print. 
                                The first letters of each line are capitalized, and the first word of line 1 is rendered in all capitals. 
                                As another bookish touch, lines are numbered by fives in the left margin.</div>

                                are ambitious and interesting projects, a leap beyond the lyric‐descriptive poems fair‐copied in pen‐and‐ink a half‐year earlier—<a href="/apparatuses/spring_blank_verse_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRSPRINGBLANKVERSE">“Spring: Blank Verse”</span></a>, <a href="/apparatuses/wales_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-">“Wales”</span></a>, and the poems comprising

                                seems to attempt less. Perhaps the disturbing events that intervened—the Ruskinsʼ aborted <a href="/notes/tour_of_1828_note" target="_self">Tour of <span class="date-1828">1828</span></a>,

                        <div class="p">An especially valuable feature of the <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span> fair copy is the evidence of <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs participation in the compositional process. 
                                At line 54 of the poem, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs handwriting can be unmistakably identified. The intervention is a penciled correction of a mistranscription of a word from the draft text, 
                                substituting the word “bear” for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs erroneously copied “appear”. The insertion is accompanied by a penciled deletion of “appear” using a style of strikethrough that differs from all other instances of strikethrough, save one at line 30 
                                (see the textual gloss hanging from line 54, <span class="gloss-inline">

                                From this evidence, one may infer that a series of other pencil marks on the manuscript—a diagonal or double diagonal line at the end of each line of verse—records 
                                <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs proofreading of the fair copy against the draft manuscript. That these diagonal marks were <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs is substantiated by their replacement by <i>×</i> marks next to certain lines of verse, 
                                which evidently signaled her concerns, prompting revisions by <span class="persName-JR">John</span>. It is possible that the proofreading marks were made by somebody other than <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>—<span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, for example—but
                                his handwriting does not otherwise appear in the manuscript.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">While we can only infer <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs objections based on the content of the original verse and on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs substitution, 
                                the topics that drew her censorship seem evident enough. An <i>×</i> by the constellation <span class="name--MEDUSACONSTELLATION">Medusaʼs Head</span> suggests that the image was deemed too horrible. 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> substituted in the margin a line about the constellation, <span class="name--TELESCOPIUM-HERSCHELII">Herschelʼs Telescope</span>, replacing the ancient wonder of <span class="persName-fictional-MEDUSA">Medusa</span>ʼs stare, 
                                with which the pagan hero <span class="persName-fictional-PERSEUS">Perseus</span> wreaked violence and retribution, with the modern wonder of the seven‐foot optical instrument, with which the British scientific hero, <span class="persName-WHERSCHEL">William Herschel</span> (<span class="date-1738-1822">1738–1822</span>), 
                                discovered the planet <span class="name--URANUS">Uranus</span>.

                                and some lines were marked with an <i>×</i> for no obvious reason other than to improve the verse: the trite and redundant epithet “pretty” was rejected,

                                first writing in cursive with a pencil, and then in some cases writing in cursive with pen and ink to revise the revision over top of the pencil.
                                Insofar as the available evidence shows, then, the revisions were invented by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>; no other hand is present in the draft revision, 
                                although of course we cannot know what discussion, if any, surrounded his decisions. We also cannot know for certain at what point in the fair‐copying 
                                the process of proofreading and marking for revision began. Since the poem is fair‐copied through to the end of the extant <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> draft, 
                                it is reasonable to conclude that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> completed the fair‐copying before it was subjected to scrutiny, although some finishing touches are incomplete: 
                                the marginal line numbering halts after line 60, with fifteen remaining lines left unnumbered; and as already remarked, most punctuation, particularly at the ends of verse lines, 
                                is abandoned after about line 20. Perhaps at this final stage of touch‐up, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> (or perhaps <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> as well as <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>) 
                                intervened with a review. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may even have been surprised by the demand for revision. The manuscript is unique among the juvenilia 
                                as a fair copy that was subjected to a critique, resulting in revisions made on the fair copy itself.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">It may be no coincidence that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs marginal line‐numbering was arrested at line 60, since at lines 57–60 the most extensive single passage 
                                is flagged for revision, with a long diagonal line and <i>×</i>s marking a quatrain about the constellation <span class="name--LIBRA">Libra (the Scales)</span>, ending in a mention of the <span class="name--MILKYWAY">Milky Way</span>. 
                                The passage may have been flagged merely because the original lines, both in draft and fair copy, are somewhat incoherent: 
                                the lines develop a paradox of the <span class="name--LIBRA">Scales</span> being capable of weighing “nothing” yet containing a “thousand more”—more even than “the beautiful <span class="name--MILKYWAY">milky way</span>”—but 
                                with the implied object, <i>stars</i>, being absent from the lines. The omission may or may not have been deliberate, 
                                but instead of revising to clarify the paradoxical conceit, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> substituted a couplet that veers to a different topic altogether—<span class="name--LIBRA">the Scales</span> as a symbol of justice, 
                                which was a traditional treatment of this constellation, particularly in Roman astronomy (see the contextual gloss hanging from line 57,

                                and then, at the bottom and top‐right of the inner fold (pp. 3–4), he overwrote this pencil draft with pen and ink, still in cursive, 
                                recasting the lines on <span class="name--LIBRA">Libra</span> as the couplet they became in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> fair copy. 
                                Next, on remaining space in the middle of the inner recto (p. 3), and over top of pencil draft on the back (p. 4), 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drafted in pen and ink new lines on the <span class="name--MILKYWAY">Milky Way</span> as they appear in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> fair copy (lines 65–69).
                                In these new lines, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> expanded on the <span class="name--MILKYWAY">Milky Way</span>, previously mentioned only as a comparison with what stars could be weighed in <span class="name--LIBRA">Libra</span>ʼs scales. 
                                Now he elaborated on the myth of the <span class="name--MILKYWAY">Milky Way</span> as a roadway to heaven for the heroes of mythology. In connection with this image, his revisions reveal that

                        and other astronomical phenomena, was composed in context of popular education in astronomy for adults and children 
                        in the <span class="date-1800-1834"> early nineteenth century</span> in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>. This movement 
                        is surveyed in <a href="/notes/astronomy_note" target="_self">Astronomical Education</a>, and parts of the following discussion are keyed to the context of that broader note.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs purpose in <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span> is more poetic than scientific. 
                        As his most original contribution to the versified catalogue of constellations that constitutes the poem, he assigns descriptive epithets to several of the constellation names. 
                        While the poem is not entirely lacking in the influence of childrenʼs scientific lessons in astronomy, which were typical the period, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> admitted in a note added belatedly in the compositional process—the note first appears in the <a href="#COMPPUB-2D-FAIR-COPY">Second Fair Copy</a>—that 
                        his arrangement of constellation names is unsystematic with respect to the starsʼ actual positions in the sky. 
                        The note is less disingenuous than it seems and may play down a significant achievement in spatial imagination 
                        (see <a href="#PROJECT">“The Constellations” as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception</a>); 
                        nonetheless, the poem represents an early and playful stage in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs ongoing astromical education 
                        (see <a href="#STAGE">“The Constellations” as Marking a Stage of Astronomical Education</a>).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">As a stage of learning, the poem is somewhat elusive in allowing one to gauge the extent of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs knowledge about the constellations and their myths. 
                        He derived some of his epithets, not from mythology, but from fables—particularly stories that could apply to constellations representing beasts and birds 
                        (see <a href="#MYTHS">Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology</a>). 
                        Given his motherʼs censorship described in <a href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-MR"><span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs Role in the Fair‐Copying Process</a>, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have avoided expressing some of what he knew about myth. Regrettably, to understand his exposure, the identity of a “lesson book” on astronomy mentioned in 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III”</span></a> remains conjectural, 
                        but on the evidence of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span> he must have had access to an up‐to‐date source 
                        like a recent star atlas, which likely would have relayed legendary as well as scientific information 
                        (see <a href="/notes/astronomy_note#PRINTSOURCES-ATLASES" target="_self">Astronomical Education: Print Sources of Astronomical Education—Star Atlases</a>; 
                        and <a href="#MYTHS">Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology</a>). 
                        There has also survived a celestial globe belonging to the family, which is dated ca. 1820, the decade when Ruskin composed "The Constellations", and which was 
                        manufactured by <a href="/notes/smith_and_son_cartographer_note" target="_self">Smith & Son</a>

                        contextual glosses attached to each of the constellation names summarize the information commonly available in popular works on astronomy published in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>. 
                        The information includes the position in the sky and the periods of the year when each constellation was visible, if at all, in the night sky above <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>; 
                        the legends, if any, associated with each constellation, especially the more commonly known Greek and Roman myths connected with ancient constellations; 
                        and the origin of comparatively more recent constellations and their significance for British amateur astronomers in the <span class="date-1800-1834">early nineteenth century</span> 
                        (e.g., at this time, the heavens were mapped with a large number of constellations invented between the <span class="date-1500-1799">sixteenth and eighteenth centuries</span>, which became obsolete in the later <span class="date-1800-1999">nineteenth and twentieth centuries</span>; 
                        also, some constellations were typically treated as pairs, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> for some reason separated and named singly in his poem). 
                        Given the uncertainty about <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs sources of information, the glosses survey what <span class="persName-JR">he</span> may have known, not what he necessarily did know or was allowed or encouraged to learn.</div>

                        is presumptive, based on evidence of his familiarity with this work in

                     <div class="p">It is possible that this first stage of astronomical education, preceding and contemporaneous with the composition of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span>, 
                        also relied on one of the primers in astronomical science written for children in the first third of the century 
                        (see <a href="/notes/astronomy_note#PRINTSOURCES-PRIMERS" target="_self">Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children</a>). 
                        This kind of text was more likely to emphasize memorization rather than dialogic exchange; and primers of the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> for young readers 
                        perhaps more emphatically staked the purpose of astronomical study in religious admiration rather than practical and scientific reasoning. 
                        In its form, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem embodies the memorization exercises typical of these primers, while its rhetoric reflects no particular agenda of piety—at least not initially so. 
                        Arguably, that agenda is layered over the initial version, at the urging of <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs flags for revision 
                        (see <a href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-MR">Margaret Ruskinʼs Role in the Fair‐Copying Process</a> and

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> recorded statistical astronomical information in his

                        which was typically found in sophisticated print sources known as <i>star atlases</i>, 
                        although such information was also plagiarized from star atlases in the more advanced astronomical primers for young readers, 
                        such as <span class="persName-JASPIN">Aspin</span>ʼs <a href="/notes/bibliography#ASPINASTRONOMY" target="_self"><span class="title-book-ASPINASTRONOMY"><i>A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</i></span></a>. 
                        The identity of this type of source or sources used by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> remains elusive 
                        (see <a href="/notes/astronomy_note#PRINTSOURCES-ATLASES" target="_self">Astromical Education: Star Atlases</a>). 
                        Whatever the source, while <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs presentation of astronomical information in <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III”</span> 
                        appears more informed and sophisticated than the simple naming in <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span>, 
                        “<span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span>ʼs” approach seems flat and pedantic compared to the energy and invention of the earlier poem.

                        To what extent, if any, might <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs composition of his poem have involved actual astronomical observation?</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> opens his poem by hailing <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> and <span class="name--MARS">Mars</span>. 
                        In the instructional dialogues, planets—the <i>wandering stars</i>—are not an obvious starting point for astronomy lessons in the open air 
                        (see <a href="/notes/astronomy_note#PRINTSOURCES-DIALOGUES" target="_self">Astronomical Education: Instructional Dialogues on Astronomy</a>). Fictional tutors 
                        typically begin by asking pupils to find the most commonly recognizable constellation or <i>fixed stars</i>, <span class="name--CHARLESSWAIN">Charlesʼs Wain</span>. As suggested by an earlier poem, 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-GLENOFGLENFARG">“Glen of Glenfarg” (“Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill”)</span></a>, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had long been able to orient himself to that formation in the night sky. 
                        Nonetheless, equally striking objects for young stargazers are <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span>, the <i>Morning Star</i> and <i>Evening Star</i>, 
                        and <span class="name--MARS">Mars</span>, the red planet. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        may have chosen those planets to begin his poem because they are famously beautiful and striking celestial bodies with familiar mythological associations. In his books, <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> was singled out for the planetʼs beauty 
                        (see <a href="#PROJECT">“The Constellations” as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception</a>). 
                        It is also possible that the particular alignment described in the poem—<span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> and <span class="name--MARSPLANET">Mars</span> visible on the ecliptic, with the constellation <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span> setting on the horizon—indicates an actual and datable observation.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">In the poem, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> positions <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> specifically as the Evening Star near the constellation <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span>.

                        <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> would have been visible from <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> as the Evening Star,

                        in the constellation <span class="name--CANISMAJOR">Canis Major</span>. It is positioned directly below <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span>.) 
                        During those same months, <span class="name--MARS">Mars</span> would have risen from the east, traveling “high . . . [in] the sky”, as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem says, 
                        a few hours after <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> had set

                        The digital star chart shows that <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span> set in the late‐afternoon dusk of <span class="date-1828-04">April 1828</span>, preceded by <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span>; 
                        and as the weeks advanced, <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> set later in the evening than <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span>, which had vanished by sunset. 
                        A comparison of findings using the <span class="title-website-SKYANDTELESCOPE"><i>Sky & Telescope Interactive Sky Chart</i></span> with the <span class="title-essay-ASPINCALENDARIUM">Calendarium</span> identifies <span class="date-1828-04">April 1828</span>, therefore, 
                        as the period when the tracks of <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> and <span class="name--MARSPLANET">Mars</span> overlapped with a sighting of <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span>. According to the digital star chart,

                        The poem also names southern constellations that cannot be viewed from the latitude of <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> at all, 
                        but <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs choice of these appears related to a sentiment for their legends. The choice of <span class="name--CRATER">Crater</span> seems arbitrary 
                        other than its regular rising and setting in the southern sky, culminating in April (see ).</div>

                        <span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD">Tommy Merton</span>, who, “looking up to the sky . . . observed so remarkable a constellation, that he . . . begged to know the name”.

                     <div class="p">The genre of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span>, at its most basic level, is a catalogue poem, simply naming the constellations. 
                        As a list, the poem shares some characteristics with an astronomical primer, 
                        <a href="/notes/bibliography#SHERWOODASTRONOMY" target="_self"><span class="title-book-SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><i>An Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children</i></span> (<span class="date-1817">1817</span>)</a> 
                        by <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span> (<span class="date-1775-1851">1775–1851</span>). 
                        While no record of this book or a work like it is recorded in the Ruskin family library, <span class="persName-MSS">Mrs. Sherwood</span> introduces the topic of the constellations 
                        with a heading identical to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs main title, 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span>, 
                        and follows that heading with subdivisions, each with its own heading, that sorts the constellations 
                        into “Constellations in the Zodiac or Ecliptic”, “Constellations to the North of the Ecliptic”, 
                        and “Constellations to the South of the Ecliptic”—subdivisions that resemble <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs subtitle to his poem, 
                        “Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and Some of the Southern”.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">As a catalogue poem, <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span> perhaps reflects <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs pedagogical assumption that a childʼs act of naming and identifying heavenly bodies precedes 
                        understanding of the physical laws that govern their motion, and the development of a spatial imagination required to grasp the relation of the earthʼs revolutions to the apparent motion of the constellations across the sky. 
                        In each of her hemispheric categories, <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span> 
                        merely lists the names of constellations—the Latin name followed by its English translation—which 
                        matches <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs procedure in his catalogue poem, except for his added embellishment of a poetic epithet to describe some of the constellations. 
                        <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span> provides no information about each of the constellations; rather, she annotates the respective lists with a Bible verse 
                        that mentions the stars and praises the <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">Creator</span>.</div>

                            obviously represents an elementary exercise in naming and memorization. Unlike <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs lists of names, however, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs catalogue is not encased within Scripture quotations that monitor the aim of memorization with expressions of piety. 
                        Rather, the compositional history suggests that moral and Christian (but not specifically Scriptural) admonition was layered onto the poem to contain the paganism presented by its list of names.

                       of the visible galaxy. Turn the sentence around—“These constellations, though not next in the sky, are next in this poetry”—and 
                       the statement stakes a claim for poetic form.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">As an aesthetic project, <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span> derives from an exercise 
                       in spatial perception and translating that perception into a graphic representation. 
                       In <span class="title-book-DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><i>The History of Sandford and Merton</i></span>, 
                       <span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD">Tommy Merton</span> proposes to <span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</span> 
                       to memorize the positions of the stars forming the constellations by “‘mak[ing] a mark upon . . . paper for every star 
                       in <span class="name--CHARLESSWAIN">Charlesʼ Wain</span>; 
                       and I would place the marks just as I see the stars placed in the sky; and I would entreat you to write the names for me, 
                       and this I would do till I was acquainted with all the stars in the heavens’”. <span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</span> applauds the project 
                       but points out that paper is flat, whereas the sky, as <span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD">Tommy</span> says, 
                       “‘seems to rise from the earth on every side like the dome of a great church’”. 
                       “‘Then if you were to have some round body’”, <span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</span> suggests, 
                       “‘I should think it would correspond to the different parts of the sky, and you might place your stars with more exactness’”. 
                       The tutor accordingly supplies <span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD">Tommy</span> with a paper‐covered ball, 
                       enabling him to devise his own celestial globe based on his own observations of the constellations, remarking both the constellationsʼ relative positions 
                       and their nightly movements in the sky. Starting by drawing his “favourite constellation of <span class="name--CHARLESSWAIN">Charlesʼs Wain</span>”, 
                       <span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD">Tommy</span> next marks the constellation situated on the opposite side of the Pole‐star, 
                       which <span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</span> identifies as <span class="name--CASSIOPEIACONSTELLATION">Cassiopeia</span>; 
                       and then he is captured by the “grandeur and beauty” of the “glorious constellation” <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span>, 
                       which “he could not help observing . . . by intervals, all the evening” as “it seemed to pass on, in a right line drawn from east to west”

                       Is <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">“The Constellations”</span>, his version of putting the constellations on paper, albeit on flat paper?</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> begins his poem with <span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD">Tommy</span>ʼs admiration of the “grandeur and beauty” of <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span> rather than with the practical lesson initiated by 
                       <span class="persName-TD">Day</span>ʼs and <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>ʼs tutors, 
                        who advise first finding <span class="name--CHARLESSWAIN">Charlesʼs Wain</span>, then tracing its pointer stars to the <span class="name--NORTHSTAR">Pole Star</span>, 
                        thereby enabling one to locate the other northern circumpolar constellations in relation to the Wain (i.e., <span class="name--URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major</span>, the Great Bear). As <span class="persName-TD">Day</span>ʼs <span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</span> explains, “by remembering these stars” 
                        that form <span class="name--CHARLESSWAIN">Charlesʼs Wain</span>, one can “very easily observe those which are next to them, and learn their names too, till you are acquainted with the whole face of the heavens” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON" target="_self"><span class="persName-TD">Day</span>, <span class="title-book-DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><i>History of Sandford and Merton</i></span></a>, 163; see also 
                        <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>, <span class="title-book-JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><i>Scientific Dialogues</i></span>, 2:16–19). 
                       This is the practical recommendation by <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYTD">Harry Sandford</span>, the farmerʼs boy, for how to find oneʼs way when lost on a dark night. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, in lines 7–11, does name a cluster of circumpolar constellations, 
                       starting with <span class="name--URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major</span> and <span class="name--CHARLESSWAIN">Charlesʼs Wain</span>. First, however, he predicates his sequence 
                        on beauty rather than pragmatism, by beginning the poem with “stars” traditionally regarded as the most beautiful—<span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span>, the so‐called Morning Star and Evening Star, 
                        “Glittering in the evening air”, a wandering rather than a fixed star; and “beside it”, <span class="name--ORION">Orionʼs Belt</span>, 
                        “a glorious sight for all sky loving men”. Even for <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>ʼs drier <span class="persName-fictional-TUTORJJ">Tutor</span>, <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> is “by far the most beautiful of . . . all” planets, prompting a quotation from <span class="persName-JMILTON">Milton</span> praising the Evening and Morning Star; 
                        and for <span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD">Tommy Merton</span>, “<span class="name--ORION">Orion</span>, which rose every night and glittered in the south”, entices his continuing star‐gazing, perhaps also supplying <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> with his rhapsodic modifier 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><i>Scientific Dialogues</i></span></a>, 2:198;

                        From this glittering horizon, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem leads the eye aloft along the ecliptic to <span class="name--MARS">Mars</span>, “high / On his throne” 
                        and thence to the circumpolar “greater bear” with “<span class="name--CHARLESSWAIN">charlesʼs wain</span>”.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">Beyond initially declaring the constellations “a glorious sight” as opposed to a utilitarian compass, 
                       does the poem go on to form a coherent graphic translation of the sky? 
                       If, as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs belated note in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> admits, the poemʼs sequence of constellation names are “not next in the sky”—that is, 
                       if the poem does not in a systematic manner, as <span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</span> “‘entreat[s]’”, perform the functionally pedagogical purpose 
                       of “‘plac[ing] the marks just as I see the stars placed in the sky; and . . . writ[ing] the names for me, 
                       . . . till I was acquainted with all the stars in the heavens’”—then what pattern, if any, is formed by situating the constellations “next in this poetry”? 
                       Does the ordering of the constellations in the poem reveal an aesthetic, if not a practical aim?</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">While the poemʼs repeated “next” seems to line up the constellation names without a plan, 
                       the sequence of naming can be interpreted as the equivalent of <span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</span>ʼs paper globe—that is, 
                       the constellation names inscribe a formal pattern on a star map that reads as a spherical shape plotted on a flat plane. As mentioned 
                       at the start of this Discussion, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did own a celestial globe. 
                       Print sources were also available to him that contained examples of planispheres, such as <span class="persName-AJ">Jamieson</span>ʼs 
                       <span class="title-artwork-JAMIESONCELESTIALATLASPL1">“Stereographic Projection of the Northern Celestial Hemisphere on the Plane of the Equinoctial” 
                           (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS" target="_self"><span class="title-lesson-JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><i>Celestial Atlas</i></span></a>, pl. 1)</span>. 
                       <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem can be read as reversing <span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</span>ʼs suggestion, 
                       by flattening a celestial globe or dome of the sky on paper in the manner of a “stereographic projection”. 
                       The eye of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs speaker inscribes a series of arcs, first by anchoring a “glorious sight”: “there” is <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> “in the evening air”, 
                       with <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span> “beside it”. Then, having anchored <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> and <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span> on a horizontal plane, 
                       the speaker raises the eye “high” to <span class="name--MARSPLANET">Mars</span>, thus forming an arc. 
                       <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> anchors an on the horizon and inscribes a spatial arc upward in the sky. 
                       As the poem goes on to name the constellations, a spatial pattern emerges of repeated anchoring and arcing, tracing a verbal planisphere.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">The sequence begins with the northern circumpolar constellations (lines 7–11), as do the printed scientific dialogues. 
                       In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs sources, the dialogues typically identify only a few of these constellations—<span class="name--CHARLESSWAIN">Charlesʼs Wain</span> inside of <span class="name--URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major</span>, 
                       its pointer stars leading the eye to the <span class="name--POLARIS">Pole Star</span>, which forms the tip of <span class="name--URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor</span>ʼs tail. 
                       In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, the circumpolar constellations serve repeatedly as an anchor to which the sequence returns at fairly regular intervals: 
                       <span class="name--CHARLESSHEART">Cor Caroli</span> (Charlesʼs Heart, line 13), <span class="name--URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor</span> (Little Bear, line 18), 
                       <span class="name--CEPHEUS">Cepheus</span> and <span class="name--BOOTES">Bootes</span> (line 27), <span class="name--LYNX">Lynx</span> (line 30), and <span class="name--CAMELOPARDALIS">Cameleopardalis</span> (line 33). 
                       In between these returns to the center, the poem arcs outward by naming constellations on the periphery of the planisphere. 
                       This oscillating pattern begins by naming <span class="name--CYGNUS">Cygnus</span> (the Swan, line 12), which, 
                       viewed from <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, skirts the north‐northeast horizon (i.e., at 9:00 P.M. in the evening, to adopt <span class="persName-JASPIN">Aspin</span>ʼs standard, and choosing the <span class="date-1828-01-1828-04">first quarter of 1828</span> for observation). 
                       From <span class="name--CYGNUS">Cygnus</span>, the poemʼs next‐named constellation (<span class="name--CHARLESSHEART">Cor Caroli</span>) returns the viewer to the center, only to be directed back to the periphery with <span class="name--MEDUSACONSTELLATION">Caput Medusae</span> (Medusaʼs Head, line 14, as originally drafted and fair‐copied), 
                       which lies on the north‐northwest horizon. This time, before returning to the center, the next named constellation circles the viewer back to the northeast horizon near <span class="name--CYGNUS">Cygnus</span>, 
                       by calling out <span class="name--EQUULEUS">Equuleus</span> (Little Horse), <span class="name--ANSER">Anser</span> (Goose), and <span class="name--LYRA">Lyra</span> (Lyre) (lines 15–17). Then back to the center (<span class="name--URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor</span>), only to rebound to the <span class="name--CYGNUS">Cygnus</span> group in the northeast by naming <span class="name--VULPECULA">Vulpecula</span> (the Fox, line 19; see plates 14–15 of <span class="name--URANIASMIRROR"><i>Uraniaʼs Mirror</i></span>, which picture all these constellations). 
                       The pattern is comparable to placing oneʼs thumb on the polar north of a celestial globe, or on the center‐point of a planisphere map of the northern hemisphere, 
                       and extending oneʼs fingers first toward the quadrant containing <span class="name--CYGNUS">Cygnus</span>, and then rotating toward the quadrant containing <span class="name--PERSEUSCONSTELLATION">Perseus et Caput Medusae</span>, and then back again.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">Having established this sideways rotation, at line 20 the poem plunges into the southern hemisphere, casting a meridian arc from North Pole to South Pole. 
                       Thus, a circle becomes a sphere. Naming the “blessed cross”, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> forms a latitudinal vector that can point simultaneously north and south, 
                       since the name <i>cross</i> can refer either to <span class="name--CYGNUS">Cygnus</span>, which is also known as the Northern Cross, 
                       or to <span class="name--CRUX">Crux</span>, the Southern Cross. To confirm the southern direction, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> next names <span class="name--ROBURCAROLINUM">Robur Carolinum</span> (Charlesʼs Oak, line 21), which is nearly adjacent to <span class="name--CRUX">Crux</span>. 
                       Then, sending a latitudinal line back up the sphere, the sequence passes through <span class="name--CRATER">Crater</span> (the Cup, line 22)—a 
                       southern constellation that, unlike <span class="name--CRUX">Crux</span> and <span class="name--ROBURCAROLINUM">Robur Carolinum</span>, lies far enough north to be visible from <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> on the southwest horizon. 
                       Continuing north, the poem lands on <span class="name--HERCULESCONSTELLATION">Hercules</span> and <span class="name--CERBERUSCONSTELLATION">Cerberus</span> (lines 23–24), near the northern pole. 
                       Having inscribed this latitudinal circle, the poem returns to the longitudinal circle by again naming constellations in the <span class="name--CYGNUS">Cygnus</span> group—<span class="name--LACERTA">Lacerta</span> (the Lizard, line 25),

                     <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> makes a point of naming constellations with British associations,

                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> also lends an English inflection to constellation names where possible: for example, <span class="name--APUS">Apus</span> is not the tropical Bird of Paradise

                     <div class="p">British pride in the nationʼs standing in astronomy was aroused by competition with the French. 
                        The French astronomer, <span class="persName-NLL">Nicolas‐Louis de Lacaille</span> (<span class="date-1713-1762">1713–62</span>), who mapped the stars in the southern hemisphere 
                        from the vantage of the <span class="placeName-CAPEOFGOODHOPE">Cape of Good Hope</span> in <span class="placeName-SAFRICA">south Africa</span>, took aim at <span class="placeName-ROBURCAROLINUM">Robur Carolinum</span>, which honored <span class="persName-KC2">Charles II</span> of <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>. 
                        As <span class="persName-NLL">Lacaille</span> created numerous new constellations of his own in the southern hemisphere, he eliminated the British honorific constellation, 
                        criticizing its inventor, the English astronomer <span class="persName-EHALLEY">Edmond Halley</span> (<span class="date-1656-1742">1656–1742</span>), for an illogical redistribution of stars originally 
                        belonging to the ancient southern constellation, <span class="name--ARGONAVIS">Argo Navis</span> (the Ship of the Argonauts). 
                        Restoring <span class="name--ROBURCAROLINUM">Robur</span>ʼs stars to the shipʼs prow, <span class="persName-NLL">Lacaille</span> justified uprooting <span class="name--ROBURCAROLINUM">Robur</span> on ostensibly scientific grounds, 
                        given that new constellations typically were formed from “unformed” stars—that is, stars ignored by <span class="persName-PTOLEMY">Ptolemy</span> in plotting the ancient constellations—rather 
                        than by robbing old constellations of their stars for new configurations. In designing his own new constellations, 
                        <span class="persName-NLL">Lacaille</span> was inspired by an Enlightenment principle of honoring the modern arts and sciences rather than paying tribute to individual monarchs. 
                        Historians suspect <span class="persName-LACAILLE">Lacaille</span>, however, of a prejudicial view when targeting specifically a British honorific constellation, 
                        while inconsistently retaining constellations that paid tribute to other nationsʼ rulers

                        The rivalry persisted in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs time, when an <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> British astronomy manual bitterly mocked an attempt

                        and may have animated his choice to name the constellation <span class="name--CAMELOPARDALIS">Camelopardalis (the Giraffe)</span>, 
                        although he assigns it no contextualizing epithet. In <span class="date-1827-1828">1827–28</span>, the first living specimen of a giraffe

                        Ruskin struck out "history" and substituted "knowledge", thus extending the sway of "virtue" over a potentially broader scope of ways of knowing. 
                        Objectionable knowledge in this poem took two forms, as suggested by the lines that his mother flagged for revision and Ruskin's consequent revisions: 
                        evocations of horror or violence, and examples of paganism that approached blasphemy from a Christian perspective

                        <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span> cannot avoid the pagan, mythical names of the constellations, but she avoids alluding to the myths themselves, 
                        defining the constellations neutrally as “remarkable groups or clusters of stars, to which names of various figures have been given”. 
                        She does not pursue the identity of the figures or their stories, presumably fearing that a fascination with the myths approaches idolatry, 
                        as suggested by a quotation she delivers from <span class="title-scripture-CHRONICLES">Chronicles</span>: 
                        “For great is the <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">Lord</span>, and greatly to be praised: 
                        he also is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods of the people are idols: the Lord made the heavens” 
                        (<span class="title-scripture-1CHRONICLES">1 Chron 16</span>: 25–26). Instead, <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span> 
                        directs admiration of the stars toward Christian praise: “We find in Scripture the glory of the righteous in the resurrection compared to that of the stars;

                        treating the mythic origins of the constellations as useful knowledge: “The names and figures are of very ancient date, 
                        and are still retained for the sake of distinction, as well as to avoid confusion in comparing ancient with modern observations”

                        This functional justification does not prevent <span class="persName-JASPIN">Aspin</span> from summarizing the “fables” associated with each of the constellations—summaries keyed to the cards depicting the mythical figures, 
                        which are collected in <span class="name--URANIASMIRROR"><i>Uraniaʼs Mirror</i></span>. 
                        <span class="persName-JASPIN">Aspin</span> reconciles the pagan tales with Christian revelaton by occasionally interpreting 
                        the mythical figures as biblical types (in the contextual glosses on the poem, see Aspin's commentary, e.g., on 
                        , 
                        , and

                     <div class="p">Jacob Green, Aspin's American competitor for the market in illustrated guides to the mythology of the constellations, 
                        and Alexander Jamieson, whose illustrations in the Celestial Atlas were plagiarized by the artists for both Green's Astronomical Recreations and 
                        for Urania's Mirror, were given to jousting with more specific theological controversies surrounding astronomical lore. 
                        Green fumed, for example, over the controversy surrounding the Zodiac of Dendera--an Egyptian stone antiquity representating the zodiac, 
                        which was purloined by French agents during the Napoleonic era and believed by some savants to predate the generations of Noah by thousands of years. 
                        Contradicting the biblical narrative, the Zodiac of Dendera appeared to present an alignment of equinoxes with constellations that the artifact's creators 
                        could have witnessed only in an ancient sky from long before the Flood, as proven by calculations based on the precession of the earth's poles. 
                        This controversy, which provoked a surprising investment of scientific, philologial, theological, and political attention 
                        (see Buchwald and Josefowicz, The Zodiac of Paris), 
                        was countered dismissively by Green with an appeal to the popular theological lectures of Thomas Chalmers 
                        (see the contextual gloss on ). 
                        While Green's appeal is complacent and reactionary, Chalmers's blending of natural theology and Scottish evangelicalism 
                        probably reflected the standing of Ruskin's parents on questions of conflict between science and biblical authority.

                     <div class="p">Within this range of solutions to reconciling secular astronomical learning with the sacred, Ruskin is unequal to the third approach--an engagement 
                        with the varieties of natural theology, which attempt a dialogue between science and faith--but he combines the other two approaches in the conclusion 
                        to "The Constellations". First, in his declaration that "history" or "knowledge" is less "bright" than "virtue", he effectively adopts Mrs. Sherwood's strategy 
                        of bluntly subordinating astronomical facts to Bible quotations. Comparing their treatments of the planet Mercury, 
                        which Ruskin likens to virtue, one finds Mrs. Sherwood's information about that planet dominated by a quotation from Acts. 
                        Paul and Barnabas, while preaching in the Roman colony of Lycaonia, are horrified to be confused by their audience with pagan gods, Mercury (Hermes) and Jupiter (Zeus). 
                        Amazed that Paul successfully commanded a cripple to walk, the Lycaonians "lifted up their voices, saying . . . 
                        'The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!'". The point of the episode is to condemn as idolatrous 
                        any knowledge other than the apostles' witness. In Mrs. Sherwood's transcription:</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="floating-text">

                           <div class="p">And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker. 
                                    Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, 
                                    and would have done sacrifice with the people. Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, 
                                    heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? 
                                    We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you, that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, 
                                    which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein.</div>

                     <div class="p">In the exercise that Mrs. Sherwood recommends for the use of her book, the child reader is expected to memorize and recite 
                        this passage of scripture along with a few facts about the planet (see 
                        <a href="/notes/astronomy_note#PRINTSOURCES-PRIMERS" target="_self">Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children</a>). 
                        No application of the scripture is invited or necessary, since the message is flattened to the solitary implication that any learning is idolatrous that fails to lead to praise of the Creator.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">Ruskin's comparison of "beauteous" Mercury with virtue entails an additional level of interpretation, however, 
                        since his choice of Mercury implies a typological reading based on knowledge that Mrs. Sherwood prohibits--the 
                        myths of Hermes. Even the story from Acts requires such knowledge to explain why the Lycaonians believed Paul to be Hermes, given that 
                        "he was the chief speaker". Ruskin may have found an explanation in a reference work on Greek and Roman mythology known to have existed in the family library, 
                        and probably acquired in the 1820s when he composed "The Constellations": 
                        The Pantheon: Or, Ancient History of the Gods of Greece and Rome,

                        Here, Ruskin would have found pleasure in the attributes of the god of eloquence:</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="floating-text">

                           <div class="p">[Mercury] "is said to be the inventor of letters; and his Greek name, Hermes, 
                                    is derived from a word in that language which signifies "to interpret" or "explain": 
                                    in this quality Mercury is the God of eloquence, as Apollo is the God of poetry: 
                                    an ingenious writer of the present age (John Horne Tooke, in his Diversions of Purley) 
                                    has considered the wings which this God annexes to his feet, as emblematical of the wings 
                                    which language gives to the thoughts of men.</div>

                     <div class="p">While this extended gloss identifies Mercury with oratory, Ruskin's more surprising association of the deity with virtue 
                        requires examining the effects of eloquence. To make this case, The Pantheon is a compelling source, 
                        since Godwin disassociates Mercury from the evil uses of rhetoric, just as he exonerates the god from dishonest uses of buying and selling, 
                        in his role as "inventor of traffic, . . . said to have introduced the use of weights, measures, and contracts". 
                        In an exception that John James Ruskin would perhaps have appreciated, Godwin argues that "licentiousness" in 
                        the "Greek imagination" led them to have "indecorously represented Mercury as the God of thieves", 
                        since a failing lies in human nature and in the system of traffic itself, which is "too apt to degenerate into a system of fraud": 
                        "[W]hen men engage in buying and selling and barter as a profession, the more keen and grasping among them will endeavour to buy cheap and sell dear, 
                        and cozen and overreach those with whom they have any dealings" 
                        (Baldwin [pseud. Godwin], The Pantheon, 58).</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">Thus, whereas Mrs. Sherwood's exercise sets up a hierarchy of whole categories of knowledge, Godwin's approach undertakes to educate 
                        the child reader's own imagination, which he engages by humanizing the sacred: 
                        "There are many things related of this God, which forcibly suggest to us the idea of a man, 
                        who for his great and essential services to his fellow-beings, was worshipped as a divinity after his death". 
                        Mercury wields magical powers by virtue of his <i>caduceus</i>--the winged wand coiled by two serpents, which he carries--but 
                        the magic resides less in this instrument itself than in its uses, its "sovereign power in appeasing quarrels and controversies":</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="floating-text">
                        
                        <div>
                           
                           <div class="p">if the God touched with . . . [the caduceus] two mortal enemies, they instantly began to regard each other with eyes of affection: 
                                    one of the earliest experiments that was made of it in this respect, happened thus: two serpents were fighting with terrible fierceness; 
                                    their eyes flashed fire, their hissings were infernal, it seemed as if the combat could end in nothing less than the destruction of both: 
                                    Mercury, happening to come by, touched them with his wand; they were immediately at peace; 
                                    they embraced each other; they wreathed themselves round the instrument of their reconciliation, 
                                    and remained ever after the ornament of the caduceus of the God.</div>

                            with transparancies projected by a magic lantern (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#HUANGURANIA" target="_self"><span class="persName-H-FHUANG">Huang</span>, <span class="title-essay-HUANGURANIA">“When Urania Meets Terpsichore”</span></a>, 49–51, 66 n. 23). 
                            For <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>, criticism of these spectacles pertains not just to quack lecturers and creaky, dysfunctional orreries, 
                            which <span class="persName-H-FHUANG">Huang</span> finds in satires of the day (<a href="/notes/bibliography#HUANGURANIA" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-HUANGURANIA">“When Urania Meets Terpsichore”</span></a>, 62–63); 
                            as a more fundamental criticism, <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span> points to conflicts with reformersʼ principles of effective pedagogy.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">From <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>ʼs viewpoint, the theatrical spectacle is a grand but passive presentation, discouraging learning through experience and self—discovery. 
                            Even though <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> had failed to complete his own orrery because he over—reached his abilities, the stage orrery is 
                            “particularly interesting to <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span>” thanks only to “the pains he had taken, and the various attempts he had made, 
                            to understand and to represent” the revolving bodies. The other “little children” in the audience went “dead asleep” 
                            and “even he”, <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span>, “after all his reading in [<span class="persName-JJ">Jeremiah Joyce</span>ʼs] 
                            <span class="title-book-JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><i>Scientific Dialogues</i></span>, had much difficulty sometimes in understanding both the machine and the lecturer”. 
                            <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>ʼs most severe criticism is aimed at the failure to scale knowledge to the age—appropriate accessibility of young listeners. 
                            The lecturer overwhelms the audience “with a vast number of words, which” <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> “strained his attention” to understand, 
                            trusting that the lengthy explanations “were all necessary”, yet “of which nearly half were nothing to the purpose” and put <span class="persName-fictional-MARYME">Mary</span> to sleep altogether. 
                            It is the sight of the real moon on the ride home that prompts a spontaneous appreciation of sublimity from <span class="persName-fictional-MARYME">Mary</span>: 
                            “‘How beautiful!’ said she: ‘and how—’ sublime! she would have said, but she did not know the word well enough: 
                            she knew the feeling”. <i>Feelings</i> are represented as accessible, regardless of age and learning; 
                            and despite <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>ʼs promotion of the Industrial Sublime in <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span>,

                            What is the orrery compared to this, <span class="persName-fictional-MARYME">Mary</span>! . . . How grand! 
                            how different from any thing that the most ingenious man in this world can make!”

                            the most comprehensive view of the constellations was presented as the finale. Could <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> have conceived of his poem 
                            as an ekphrastic version of this final, totalizing scene? Apparently, in this show, a transparency 
                            exhibited a circle of the starry night, surrounded by concentric rings to suggest infinitude.

                            published by <span class="persName-RW">Robert Wilkinson</span>, Scene 1 represented the earth and sun by turning the orbit vertically to the audience,

                            The <span class="name--ZODIAC">Zodiac</span> constellations were represented by their respective mythological figures. 
                            Perhaps the transparency for the Last Scene exhibited a similar ring of constellations in their mythological guise, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in his way has reproduced.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">The beginning of the poem, however, starts with a version of Scene 1 in the Walkersʼ exhibition—or more precisely, a portion of their Scene 4—with 
                            the rising and setting of <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> and <span class="name--MARS">Mars</span>. 
                            As noted earlier, the poem is atypical of <span class="persName-TD">Day</span>ʼs and <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>ʼs 
                            introductions to the constellations, which begin with finding the circumpolar constellations in the sky. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            incorporates that observation as the second stage of his poem. The <span class="name--ZODIAC">Zodiac</span> constellations form a distinct piece within the poem. 
                            The most significant point to draw from the context of the Lenten astronomy lectures is that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs catalogue 
                            may have attempted a sublime totality, an expression of religious awe.</div>
