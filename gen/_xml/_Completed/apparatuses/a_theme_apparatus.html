                            the fragment of argument transcribed by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> corresponds to the sentiments, if not specific language and examples, of an essay 
                            in the <a href="/notes/evangelical_magazine_note" target="_self"><span class="title-periodical-EVANGELICALMAG"><i>Evangelical Magazine</i></span></a>,

                            its date makes a good fit with a terminus ad quem for <span class="title-essay-JRATHEME">“a theme”</span> based on the position of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs piece in <span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span>, 
                            particularly if the magazine essay originated in a sermon or lecture that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> might have heard a month or two earlier. 
                            Regardless of whether this published essay had any specific connection with the origin of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs transcript, however, 
                            its argument and context may help to illuminate the circumstances surrounding what <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> heard.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">The subtitle of the <span class="title-periodical-EVANGELICALMAG"><i>Evangelical Magazine</i></span> essay describes its purpose: 
                            “An attempt to ascertain what Classes of Professing Christians are most defective in liberality towards the cause of Evangelical Religion, both at Home and Abroad”. 
                            The audience is the “church of <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">God</span>”, and the London Missionary Society (LMS) in particular, which has taken on “nothing less 
                            <i>than the conversion of the whole world to <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">God</span></i>”. The writer believes that the Christian liberality on which this enormous mission depends is 
                            “but imperfectly understood, and but partially felt” if the LMS congratulates itself on having raised forty‐six thousand pounds in the previous year—a sum that 
                            may seem munificent compared to collections prior to the cause of foreign missions, but that is paltry compared to the goal that the (British) church has now set for itself. 
                            The moral danger of underestimating both the challenges of the missions and their cost is a “prone[ness] to set up wrong standards of duty, and to make ill‐established comparisons of conduct, 
                            and thus to flatter ourselves into groundless conceits of our high attainments in moral excellence”. Rhetorically, then, the speaker poses both as an “expostulating friend” 
                            against the “unbelief and selfishness” of the “Classes of Professing Christians” who are “defective in liberality” and as a skeptical agent who is not dazzled into complacency by seeming success (pp. 180–81, 184–85). 
                            The speaker recorded by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> targets comparatively vulnerable classes in theater‐goers and trinket buyers, 
                            and the speaker even falters when invoking the enormity of the charitable goal, but the rhetorical structure of the talk that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> heard presumably was similar to this essay. 
                            Such arguments formed a context of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs later rhetorical exaggerations in <span class="title-essay-JRNATUREOFGOTHIC">“The Nature of Gothic”</span> in which he compares ladies who buy glass beads to slave drivers.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">In a similar fashion, the <span class="title-periodical-EVANGELICALMAG"><i>Evangelical Magazine</i></span> essay proceeds to identify groups who fail in Christian liberality. 
                            First to be called out are “our more wealthy ministers”, hypocrites who hoard their own wealth while urging their congregations to philanthropy. The next classification would have struck the Ruskins as closer to home—the 
                            the secular “rich”, specifically “the men who have either retired from business with their comfortable competency of one, two, or three thousand a year and upwards; 
                            or who are still in trade with an income of the same amount”. Rich men in these circumstances, the writer supposes, annually allow perhaps a total of thirty pounds to 
                            “the cause of religion generally, both at home and abroad”, an amount the writer considers the least “they ought to contribute to the cause of Missions alone” (pp. 182–83). 
                            By this standard, <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> was generous, effectively tithing a tenth of his income. In <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, to sample just that year, he received £3853 in income from his firm plus a few hundred pounds from other sources, 
                            while he logged £229 in “Charity & Gifts” as well as £135 to support three of his nieces and nephews orphaned by the death of his sister and £38 to help <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs relations. 
                            <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs abbreviated notes make it difficult to sort the donations precisely among religious, secular, and family causes, but all three categories 
                            are certainly represented. The various “church” and “Bible” donations include £50 for “orphans” paid to the familyʼs clergyman, <span class="persName-EA">Edward Andrews</span>, 
                            but how much, if any, went to foreign missions in this year is obscure (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFMS28" target="_self">Account Book</a>, 15r, 13r, 13v).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">The remaining classes named in the essay as failing to give their share are “the Christians who inhabit small towns and villages”, 
                            the fault lying in part with the “great public institutions of the age” habitually looking to the metropolis for support, but also 
                            with village dwellers who “have never seriously considered their obligations to the cause of <span class="persName-scriptural-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span> at large” (p. 183). 
                            In fact, by <span class="date-1820">1820</span> the LMS had established a nationwide network of local auxiliaries, so the speaker is here haranguing an existing audience

                            Finally, the writer is stern with “young persons, who, though they live with their parents, possess a separate income at their own disposal”, yet substitute their parentsʼ benevolence 
                            for their own (p. 184). For years to come, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> relied on his father for charities that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> did not necessarily approve, but <span class="persName-JR">John</span> controlled no income of his own until after his fatherʼs death.

                            More specifically, the Ruskins may have been drawn into a fascination with foreign missions by the rising career of their favorite preacher,

                            Preached by the <span class="persName-RAREV">Reverend Richard Alliott</span>, <span class="title-sermon-ALLIOTTNATUREOBLIGATION">“The Nature and Obligation of Christian Liberality”</span> was based on <span class="title-scripture-MATTHEW">Matthew 10:8</span>: 
                            “Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give”. 
                            The argument traced the Christian obligation of liberality to the Apostlesʼ endowment with “miraculous powers by the use of which they might bave enriched themselves” 
                            were it not that such use of their powers “was wholly inconsistent the character of . . . [<span class="persName-scriptural-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span>ʼs] dispensation”. Just so, <span class="persName-RAREV">Alliott</span> pressed his hearers, 
                            Christians possess “the Gospel in our hands, conveying greater and better blessings;—for these we are indebted to the bounty of <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">God</span>, and it is according to his purpose that, 
                            that which we bave freely received, we should also freely communicate”. The perorartion appealed to “<i>Philanthropists</i>, 
                            as above all other means calculated to ameliorate and improve the condition of the most barbarous and wretched of the human race; and to Englishmen, 
                            as involving in its results the honour and prosperity of our own country,—the cause of Missions being considered as, indeed, the cause of our country—of the world—of

                            The Surrey County Auxiliary Missionary Society, which arose from the <span class="date-1827-04">April 1827</span> meeting in <span class="placeName-WALWORTH">Walworth</span>, was next reported as organizing in <span class="placeName-DORKING">Dorking</span>. 
                            The sermon on that occasion was delivered by the <span class="persName-WO">Reverend William Orme</span> (<span class="date-1787-1830">1787–1830</span>), who served as foreign secretary of the LMS,

                            owned a copy of his posthumously published <span class="title-book-ORMERICHARDBAXTER"><i>Life and Times of Richard Baxter</i> (<span class="date-1830">1830</span>)</span> (<a href="/notes/bibliography#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY" target="_self"><span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span>, <span class="title-book-DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><i>Library of John Ruskin</i></span></a>, 245 [no. 1917]),
                            and they could not have missed his engraved portrait in the <span class="date-1830-01">January 1830</span> issue of the <span class="title-periodical-EVANGELICALMAG"><i>Evangelical Magazine</i></span> and his memorial in the <span class="date-1830-07">July 1830</span> issue. 
                            Could <span class="persName-WO">Orme</span>ʼs chapel have been the site of the meeting in the early months of <span class="date-1829">1829</span> that gave <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> the text of his <span class="title-essay-JRATHEME">“theme”</span>? 
                            The disdain for the theater reflected in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs theme seems an unlikely viewpoint for <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>, who wrote plays himself; and the memorial of <span class="persName-WO">Orme</span> 
                            suggests other contrasts with the <span class="placeName-WALWORTH">Walworth</span> preacher. Regarding <span class="persName-WO">Orme</span>ʼs scholarship, it was admitted, “[i]n what was strictly philological 
                            he might be excelled by those whose superior classical attainments or greater advantages might qualify them for such pursuits”—those 
                            such as the <span class="persName-EA">Reverend Dr. Andrews</span> whose classical learning was widely respected, qualifying him to tutor the precocious <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>—“but by none was [<span class="persName-WO">Orme</span>] excelled 
                            in an extensive and accurate acquaintance with the word of <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">God</span>”. In his preaching, moreover, <span class="persName-WO">Orme</span> “sought not for figures but facts; 
                            and was more conversant with arguments than ornaments”. Unlike the florid and poetically fanciful <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>, 
                            he “aimed to convince the judgment and impress the heart . . . with no attempt at ingenious conceits and far‐fetched resemblances”
