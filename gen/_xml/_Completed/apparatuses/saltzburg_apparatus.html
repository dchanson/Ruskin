                  <span class="head-subsection">The Circumstances of the Commission</span>
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-DCH">Hanson</span> has argued that <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> was misled by an assumption 
                        that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would have composed a topographical poem only about a place he had actually seen, 
                        and that therefore <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s commission for <span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span> 
                        must have been associated with his family&#x02BC;s visit to <span class="placeName-SALZBURG">Salzburg</span> 
                        during their <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/tour_of_1835_note.php");?>" target="_self">Continental tour of <span class="date-1835">1835</span></a>.  
                        This alleged timing of the commission would have been impossible, however, given that the poem must have been submitted for publication one year earlier than this journey, 
                        in order to be included in <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering . . . for MDCCCXXXV</i></span>, 
                        which was released in the winter holiday season of <span class="date-1834-11-1835-01">1834&#x2013;35</span>. 
                        Moreover, the annual&#x02BC;s editor, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/pringle_thomas_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span></a>, died in <span class="date-1834-12">December 1834</span> 
                        (see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#HANSONRUSKIN1830S");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-DCH">Hanson</span>, <span class="title-essay-HANSONRUSKIN1830S">&#x201C;Ruskin in the 1830s&#x201D;</span></a>, 122).</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">More significantly, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s underlying assumption was faulty, as well, 
                        since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poem preceded his aesthetic of &#x201C;truth to nature&#x201D; by a decade. 
                        The poem was composed in response, not to nature, but to the print culture of illustrated travel writing of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, like many other contributors to the literary annuals, 
                        had no personal experience of the place that his persona pretended to traverse; instead, his informaton about the place was drawn from printed sources, 
                        while his creative response was primarily ekphrastic, an engagement with the engraving of the foreign scene 
                        (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#HANSONRUSKIN1830S");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-DCH">Hanson</span>, <span class="title-essay-HANSONRUSKIN1830S">&#x201C;Ruskin in the 1830s&#x201D;</span></a>, 143&#x2013;47).</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">While <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> was certainly wrong about the <span class="date-1835">late 1835</span> date of this commission, his speculation about the circumstances of the assignment bear inquiry. 
                        He assumes a casual happenstance, under pressure of a deadline: &#x201C;It happened that <span class="persName-TP">Mr. Pringle</span> had a plate of <span class="placeName-SALZBURG">Salzburg</span> 
                        which he wanted to print in order to make up the volume of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span> for the next Christmas&#x201D; 
                        (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#WGCLIFEOFJR1893");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-book-WGCLIFEOFJR1893"><i>Life and Work of John Ruskin</i></span></a>, 1:52). 
                        It is credible that <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>&#x02BC;s regard for the Ruskin family and his genuine appreciation of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s abilities 
                        prompted him to solicit, for the same volume of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span> containing <span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRFRAGMENTS">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                        a work extracted and revised from the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> of the <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/tour_of_1833_note.php");?>" target="_self">Tour of 1833</a> 
                        (see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#PUBLICATION1834");?>" target="_self">Account of a Tour on the Continent: Publication&#x2014;<i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></a>). 
                        It seems an extraordinary undertaking, however, to have appointed a fifteen&#x2010;year&#x2010;old first&#x2010;time contributor to compose a text so prominent, 
                        as a poem to explain one of the eleven embellishments--for many readers, the main features of an annual. Collingwood's assumption that the assignment of <span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span> was a rush job 
                        is disproven by the probable April-May 1834 date of the poem's draft, as well as by the many differences between the draft and publsihed version, which indicate ample time for revision. 
                        Also, Ruskin's neophyte status made him an unusual choice, Pringle having previously appointed mainly experienced hands to supply letterpress for plates.</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">Pringle's commissioning of Ruskin to compose an ekphrastic verse accompaniment to Purser's engraving was, therefore, thoughtfully planned and deliberate; 
                            and the appointment of so young a contributor for such an important role was rare, and possibly unprecedented under Pringle's editorship. 
                            The editing must have entailed considerable effort, for while the presence of John James Ruskin's hand in the draft of <span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span> 
                            indicates some editorial involvement by Ruskin's father, Pringle would have had much to teach about writing for an audience beyond one's family. 
                            All of this points to a considerable act of mentorship on Pringle's part, which he put forth on top of editing  
                            <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRFRAGMENTS">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</span></a>--a 
                            selection from an existing project, which required editorial polish, but not an entirely new composition like "Saltzburg", 
                            which occupied a prominent place in the volume. If any truth lies in Ruskin's comment on Pringle's mentorship, written decades later, 
                            the experience was more overwhelming than thrilling: "Had his grave authority been maintained over me, 
                            my literary bloom would probably have been early nipped" (Ruskin, Works, 34:97).</div>

                  <div class="p">No correspondence detailing Pringle's editorial involvement in the composition <span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span> has so far been found, 
                            but a suggestion of how he may have thought about his mentorship can be gleaned from an ekphrastic assignment that he gave himself four or five years earlier, 
                            while editing his second volume of <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1830"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>, the volume for <span class="date-1830">1830</span>. 
                        It also featured an engraving after <span class="persName-WPPAINTER">William Purser</span>, apparently his first artwork for the annual, entitled <span class="title-artwork-PURSERSPOLETO"><i>Spoleto</i></span> 
                            and engraved by <span class="persName-TJEAVONS">Thomas Jeavons</span> (<span class="date-1795-1867">1795&#x2013;1867</span>). 
                            <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> reserved the task of writing the accompanying text for himself, 
                            although he had never visited the Continent, much less <span class="placeName-SPOLETO">Spoleto</span>, which was not well&#x2010;known to English travelers at the time. 
                            In 1819, Turner paused there in his first tour of Italy to sketch several views--especially the dramatic, ancient aqueduct, the Ponte dele Torri--which 
                            he did not put to use in finished work until years later. In the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>, <span class="persName-MSA">Mariana Starke</span> devoted only a brief paragraph to the town, 
                            in the course of describing the route from <span class="placeName-ROME">Rome</span> to <span class="placeName-FLORENCE">Florence</span>. 
                            Only in the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>, the decade of the Friendship's Offering piece, was more attention drawn to Spoleto for English viewers, 
                            when <span class="persName-WBI">William Brockedon</span> published an account of the picturesque scenes to be discovered in the approach to the town and surrounding countryside

                        from a distant, central vantage in the countryside above the town, with the town&#x003E;&#x02BC;s major monuments picked out in the middle ground.

                        Consisting of a prose preface and a poem, the piece fills the page facing the engraving with an extract about the town from a travelogue,

                        <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s jottings are in keeping with the governing sentiments of the literary annuals&#x2014;friendship and memory.

                            in order to focus attention on the closing poetic observation&#x2014;an evocation of the scene by moonlight, with a meditation on personal relation with history&#x2014;in contrast with

                            that frames the speaker&#x02BC;s reflections. The poem opens with an ekphrastic reading of the plate; and then the speaker assumes the classic reclining pose of a figure contemplating the prospect, 
                            and seeks to reenact <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x201C;s romantic engagement with the past:</div>

                  <div class="p">While conventional, the meditation is framed in terms of the manner of viewing the prospect that <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> has shared, 
                        as if Dorothy Wordsworth had composed a secondary "Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey, on Revisiting the Banks of the Wye"; 
                        and the poem moves on from the prospect to dwell on indebtedness and friendship, themes that define the literary annual. 
                        &#x201C;So rose the scene on <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC; classic eye&#x201D;, 
                        the final section begins, reverting to the prose preface and shared journal entry, and the section concludes with a declaration that the act of sharing testifies to one 
                        &#x201C;Whom &#x02BC;tis a pride and grace to call my Friend&#x201D;. Between these testimonials, <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> negotiates 
                        his position in this friendship, which is unequal. While his speaker has adopted <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x201C;s viewpoint, 
                        Pringle's speaker confessedly has not visited Spoleto; and viewing only its picture, this poet/speaker can produce only secondary prospect lyric, like secondary epic. 
                        Even if he did on some "reflective summer&#x02BC;s day" stretch his person before the scene, Pringle modestly denies his the capacity to measure up to it, 
                        suggesting that he lacks Rogers's "classic eye. For had Rogers made use of his journal entry, &#x201C;&#x005B;h&#x005D;ad <i>he</i> to verse transferred it &#x005B;the scene&#x005D; from his mind&#x201D;, 
                        the &#x201C;touching image&#x201D; would have been &#x201C;enshrined&#x201D; and &#x201C;embalmed in words that could ne&#x201C;er die&#x201D;. 
                        whereas &#x201C;Far other fate awaits this rustic lay, / Framed for the passing purpose of a day&#x201D;. In <span class="title-poem-PRINGLESPOLETO">&#x201C;Spoleto&#x201D;</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> transforms the workaday letterpress for a landscape print into an occasion for demonstrating the literary annual&#x02BC;s purpose of cultivating memory and fellow&#x2010;feeling;  
                        however, he also maintains the neoclassical ordering of the arts, subordinating <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span> 
                        and his own "rustic lay" to Rogers's "classic" verse  
                        (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1830");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1830"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; A Literary Album . . . for MDCCCXXX</i></span></a>, 111).</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">In this deferential conception of the annual's place in literary and artistic culture, 
                            we perhaps can glimpse the Pringle's expectations when he arranged to usher his prodigy into the <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>'s august preence, 
                            at the poet's famed <span class="placeName-STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</span> residence--an event as extraordinary as awarding the youth so splendid a commission 
                            in Friendship's Offering. No account of this episode is known to have survived, apart from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>'s later, ironic treatments of it, 
                            in "My First Editor" and Praeterita 
                            (Ruskin, Works, 34:96-97; 35:00-00). 
                            In "My First Editor"--written in memory, not of Pringle, but of his successor as editor of Friendship's Offering, 
                            W. H. Harrison, Ruskin contrasts Pringle's "grave authority" with Harrison's "ready praise" 
                            and "cheerful auspices". Ruskin does not mention his two debut poems for Friendship's Offering, characterizing Pringle's mentorship only in general terms 
                        as "doubtfully, but with benignant sympathy, admitt&#x005B;ing&#x005D; the dazzling hope that one day rhymes of mine might be seen in real print, 
                        on those amiable and shining pages". The characterization of amiability and friendship is tied to the annual itself, 
                        while a hierarchical rigidity is associated with Pringle and his "cross-examination" of Ruskin in Rogers's presence, resulting in a rebuke of the boy 
                        for "not attending" to the conversation between his elders, which Ruskin remembers only as carried on over his head 
                        (Works, 34:97, 96). The characterization is consistent with the unequal friendship between poets represented in Spoleto, 
                        and with Pringle's estimation of the literary annual as "amiable" but humble.</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">Presumably, these rankings would have carried over to Pringle's expectations when commissioning 
                            Ruskin's ekphrasis of Purser's latest picture. We can only speculate whether Pringle imagined himself relative to the youth 
                            as he estimated himself relative to Rogers. Surely, Pringle expected Ruskin reverence Rogers's stature in the neoclassical 
                            surroundings of the St. James palace of art.

                            typically at a climactic point, and the plate is tipped in close to that page in the text. The eruption that blazes in the night sky of 
                            Turner's <i>Vesuvius</i> (engraved by Jeavons) illuminates the noble identity of the banditto Il Vesuviano, as he dies in the arms his estranged lady

                            To account for Samuel Prout's plate, <i>St. Mark's Place, Venice</i> (engraved by E. J. Roberts &#x005B;1797-1865&#x005D;), 
                            Charles Macfarlane (1799-1858) is awkwardly forced to describe the monuments in Prout's modern scene that are <i>not</i> present in his tale of thirteenth-century Venice: 
                            "Venice . . . was not yet the splendid city that . . . could . . . boast that accumulation of ancient and modern art, 
                            which was afterwards to attract the stranger from many a distant land"; rather, "at the epoch of our tale, Venice was about equi-distant 
                            from what she was at her humble origin,--a collection of low huts scattered on the sea-lashed sand, banks and rocks . . . 
                            --and what she became became after the sixteenth century, when the wealth of the East had been poured in her lap, 
                            and the genius of Palladio and others had filled her with beauty". The strategy resonates with Ruskin's later comparisons of past and present monuments in Stones of Venice

                            but when writing about places he had never visited he contrived to introduce pertinent topics closer to home, as in his poem for a plate conventionally depicting a Continental garden landscape, 
                            which he makes an occasion for the cause of European political exiles ("La Fresca").
