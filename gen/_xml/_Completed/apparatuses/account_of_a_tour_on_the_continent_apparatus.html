                        there is in fact no material justification for collecting its sub&#x2010;groups into a single, grand corpus,

                        <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> printed the title, 
                        <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</span>, without square brackets, his symbol for declaring editorial intervention. 
                        Nonetheless, the title apparently originated with him, as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> assigned no title to the 
                        sequence as a whole in any of the extant manuscripts 
                        (see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891");?>" target="_self"><i>Poems</i> &#x005B;4<sup>o</sup>, 1891&#x005D;</a>, 1:119, 281;

                        Accordingly, in <i>ERM</i>, when the main title is fully spelled out, it is given without quotation

                        In commentary about the work, however, for convenience in the course of discussion, a short title is used with quotation marks (i.e., the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>) 
                        in order to avoid confusion with surrounding text.</div>

                        According to an annotation in the hand of <span class="persName-AW">Alexander Wedderburn</span>, after the time when <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span>

                        There remains in the manuscript a blank page (11r) followed by a stub of a leaf where a title for the 
                        <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> might logically have been placed

                        (see <a href="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</a>), the titles in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG1">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span> 
                        referred to individual poems, each named for the place described in the poem. Later, when he expanded the work by adding prose essays 
                        and graphic illustrations, these initial titles became section headings, each now naming the place which in most cases is described with a poem, a prose essay, and drawings.</div>

                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> invented titles for the untitled verse that he included in his arrangement of the work; 
                        and the editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> followed suit. In both editions, these titles are indicated as editorial using square brackets, 
                        but this practice was not carried out consistently. Some of these editorial titles are very convincingly what <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had in mind, based on internal evidence; 
                        others were probably a guess. The editors appear not to have made studious use of the most authoritative source of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s titles for sections he left incomplete or undrafted&#x2014;his

                        (and may not have known) specifically which &#x201C;blank pages&#x201D; were removed, evidence may have been destroyed of how many blank leaves

                        Rearrangement of drawings seems especially likely in the case of the gallery of untitled drawings that presently follows the page on which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        abandoned his fair copy of the text. He may have assembled this gallery himself after he gave up expectation of completing the fair copy, but it seems at least equally probable 
                        that he originally placed the drawings on pages, now removed, where he planned for surrounding text. See also

                        Apart from his general rule of adopting copytext from previously published versions, where available (a rule that applied to only three poems from

                        His sources can be reconstructed easily enough; for example, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g2.php");?>" target="_self">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</a>,

                        <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> were more attentive than <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>  
                        in documenting the manuscript sources used for copytext or to identify variants. For example, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> 
                        rewrites a line of the poem <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</span>, justifying the innovation by what he considers &#x201C;neither rhyme nor reason&#x201D; 
                        in an unidentified &#x201C;original&#x201D; (i.e., MS IA, <i>g</i>.1). The faulty line, he decides, is a mis&#x2010;transcription of a line from a &#x201C;rough copy, now lost&#x201D;, 
                        the existence of which is entirely suppositious, but which he declares to have been somehow &#x201C;insufficiently altered&#x201D;.

                        reject <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s rewritten line, finding merit in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;father&#x02BC;s copy&#x201D; of <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</span>

                        even though he cherishes manuscripts. Throughout the <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/poems_1891_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><span class="date-1891">1891</span> <i>Poems</i></span></a>, 
                        he consistently awards priority and adheres faithfully to previously published versions of texts&#x2014;in the case of copytext for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, 
                        deferring to earlier editors&#x02BC; interventions that resulted in texts as published in <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/friendships_offering_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span></a>

                        He pays comparatively little deference to texts as found in manuscripts, allowing himself latitude that presumably was taken by his predecessors 
                        (e.g., <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> along with <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/harrison_w_h_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-WHH">W. H. Harrison</span></a>),

                        and holding himself to an editorial principle that can at best be summarized as aesthetic preference. Creative writing is justified, 
                        if he can discern &#x201C;neither rhyme nor reason&#x201D; in a line, and the design of the <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891">1891 <i>Poems</i></span> rules over the reconstruction of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, 
                        which is presented as a work solely in verse, despite <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s intentions for a composite verse, prose, and graphic work, as reflected in his fair copy. 
                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> labored to construct an accurate manuscript chronology in the <span class="title-bibliography_text-">&#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS of the Poems&#x201D;</span>, 
                        resulting in a deservedly influential document in the history of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> editing and manuscript curation, but his concept of an &#x201C;original manuscript&#x201D; 
                        entailed no responsibility to apply that chronology meaningfully to the editing of a given work by reconstructing its compositional history.</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">Thus, for example, in editing the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> drew the main copytexts of <span class="title-poem-JRANDERNACHT">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</span> and 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRSTGOAR">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</span> from their publication as <span class="title-poem-JRFRAGMENTS">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</span>, 
                        subordinating their manuscript texts to endnotes containing what he calls their &#x201C;first sketch&#x201D; or &#x201C;first draft&#x201D; (the terms are apparently interchangeable), 
                        conceding that &#x201C;it may be interesting to compare the two versions&#x201D; (manuscript and publication) in order to show, &#x201C;if for nothing else, . . . that the young poet could polish when he chose, 
                        and that he would have eliminated the slipshod grammar and faulty rhymes if he had prepared the rest of his juvenile verses for publication&#x201D;. 
                        It seems not to have struck <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> that the interest in comparing published and manuscript versions lay, not in copyediting corrections (<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s manuscript texts, draft or fair copy, contain remarkably few errors of this kind), 
                        but in differences of diction, economy, and formal elements influenced by the respective projects to which the versions belonged. The term <i>first sketch</i> or <i>first draft</i> 
                        belies the manuscript versions of <span class="title-poem-JRANDERNACHT">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</span> and 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRSTGOAR">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</span> in particular, which are not &#x201C;slipshod&#x201D; sketches or drafts but exacting fair copies&#x2014;the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> versions 
                        transcribed in a &#x201C;copperplate&#x201D; hand directly or indirectly from the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG1">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span>, versions, 
                        a manuscript that itself appears to be a presentation copy (purpose unknown). Regardless, for <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>, the varieties of manuscript textual witness 
                        collapse into &#x201C;originals&#x201D; versus &#x201C;polished&#x201D; versions, the former disarmed of textual authority and open to seemingly limitless editorial intervention, 
                        and the latter given unquestioned authority though abstracted from the social history of editors, publishers, and printers that bestowed the authority in the first place 
                        (what <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> supposedly would have wrought for himself, had he &#x201C;chose&#x201D;)

                            This stage of composition can be dated approximately between his fifteenth birthday on <span class="date-1834-02-08">8 February</span>

                            are left with about <span class="date-1833-10-1834-04">October 1833&#x2013;April 1834</span> for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s evolving conception, draft, and fair&#x2010;copying of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Starting at about the point at which Ruskin broke off drafting and fair&#x2010;copying, he turned to the back endpapers of MS VIII to list 
                                <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-bibliography_text-">Proposed Additional Contents for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span></a>. 
                            In the first of two lists, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> details in sequential order the remaining place&#x2010;name, composite sections he intended to complete, starting with the last 
                            three he did complete in fair copy&#x2014;<span class="title-composite-JRANDERNACHTCOMP">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</span>, <span class="title-composite-JREHRENBREITSTEINCOMP">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D;</span>, 
                            and <span class="title-composite-JRSTGOARCOMP">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</span>&#x2014;followed by the section he left incomplete in fair copy, <span class="title-composite-JRHEIDELBERGCOMP">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</span>. 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> must therefore have begun compiling this list at about the point when he broke off to revise 
                            the poems <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/andernacht_poem_msia.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRANDERNACHT">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</span></a> and

                            A more definite date can be attached to the second list, in which he details the illustrations that he planned to copy from published sources 
                            for each of the planned sections in the first list. Since this second list begins with <span class="title-composite-JRHEIDELBERGCOMP">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</span>, 
                                it is logical to suppose that he started compiling the list after he had left off fair&#x2010;copying that section in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>, with the poem completed but only a few lines of the prose essay copied. 
                                The <span class="title-composite-JRHEIDELBERGCOMP">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</span> section&#x02BC;s layout leaves spaces to be filled by illustrations, 
                                which are described in the second list as gothic scenes that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> almost certainly planned to copy from

                            in <span class="date-1833-04">April 1833</span>, but it is absurd to imagine that it prompted <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s suggestion 
                            that the family &#x201C;should . . . go and see some of &#x005B;the wonderful places&#x005D; in reality&#x201D;,

                            <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> underwent a development similar to that of

                            from an all&#x2010;verse to a composite&#x2010;genre work. In the autobiography, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> admits that he has &#x201C;told this story so often&#x201D; about the influence of 
                            <span class="persName-SR">Roger</span>&#x02BC;s book and its revelation of <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s art, 
                            &#x201C;that I begin to doubt its time&#x201D;. In <span class="title-book-"><i>Praeterita</i></span>&#x02BC;s 
                            typically dramatizing fashion, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> declares that &#x201C;the main tenor of my life&#x201D; was set on 
                            <span class="date-1832-02-08">8 February 1832</span> by the birthday gift from his father&#x02BC;s business partner,

                            &#x201C;It is curiously tiresome that Mr. <span class="persName-HT">Telford</span> did not himself write my name in the book,

                            still more curiously, for him, puts no date: if it was a year later &#x005B;i.e., <span class="date-1833-02-08">8 February 1833</span>&#x005D;, no matter&#x201D; 
                            (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE");?>" target="_self">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 35:79).</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">In fact, the date range for acquaintance with <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> is even wider. 
                            In a non&#x2010;illustrated edition, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s poem had been in the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> household 
                            since <span class="date-1828">1828</span> at the latest (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#RFL");?>" target="_self">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 188 n. 4).
                            This happens to be the year when <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> published &#x201C;Part the Second&#x201D; of the poem; 
                            and growing disgusted over the work&#x02BC;s tepid reception, he bought out remaining copies of both that volume and &#x201C;Part the First&#x201D;, and destroyed them 
                            (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#ROGERSITALY1828");?>" target="_self">Rogers, <i>Italy</i> &#x005B;1828&#x005D;</a>; 
                            <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#ROGERSITALY1823");?>" target="_self">Rogers, <i>Italy</i> &#x005B;1823&#x005D;</a>; 
                            and see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/samuel_rogers_note.php");?>" target="_self">Samuel Rogers &#x005B;1763&#x2013;1855&#x005D;</a>). 
                            Thus, even before <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s poem achieved popularity in the illustrated edition, 
                            the Ruskins could count themselves among the select number of appreciative readers of the work in its original form; 
                            and it is possible that <span class="persName-HT">Telford</span>&#x02BC;s gift of the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> edition contributed to the family&#x02BC;s travel plans even earlier than <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> remembered. 
                            The first mention of &#x201C;our Switzerlandish outlandish tour to Italy&#x201D; occurs in the family letters for <span class="date-1831-03">March 1831</span>, 
                            a month after <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s twelfth birthday (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#RFL");?>" target="_self">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 253).</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">More significant than the year when <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s work first helped to shape expectations for the journey, however, 
                            is a confirmation of its special influence immediately following the family&#x02BC;s return from the Continent. 
                            According to <span class="persName-VAB">Van Akin Burd</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> purchased a copy of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> 
                            in <span class="date-1833-10">October 1833</span>, notably soon after the family&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1833-09">September</span> return home 
                            (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#RFL");?>" target="_self"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 286 n. 1).
                            Actually, the October entry in <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s personal accounts ledger records a purchase that was germane specifically 
                            to the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> rather than to the Continental tour generally. 
                            The entry reads &#x201C;Plates Italy 28/6&#x201D; (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#RFMS28");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, Account Book &#x005B;1827&#x2013;45&#x005D;</a>, 29v); 
                            and although the lack of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s name renders identification uncertain, 
                            the term <i>plates</i> suggests a portfolio of its plates alone. 
                            As <span class="persName-JPSCHOLAR">Jan Piggott</span> explains, &#x201C;the publishers of almost all the books illustrated with <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> vignettes 
                            made the engravings better known and made more profit by selling portfolios of prints from the plates. These were available in ranks of quality and price: 
                            engraver&#x02BC;s proofs; on India paper; before and after lettering; and on varying sizes of paper&#x2014;even on the absurdly large Colombier folio&#x2014;to satisfy the competitiveness of connoissures&#x201D; 
                            (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#PIGGOTTTURNERSVIGNETTES");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-book-"><i>Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes</i></span></a>, 24). 
                            While <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s strictly poetic influence on the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> was certainly considerable 
                            (see <a href="#ROGERSINFLUENCEONEXTENSION">Sources and Influences&#x2014;<span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s Poetry</a>), 
                            it was the ekphrastic influence of book illustration by <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>, <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>, 
                            <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>, and others, and the materiality of the print culture conveying their artistry, that particularly inspired <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s project, 
                            especially its expansion into a composite&#x2010;genre, illustrated version&#x2014;an expansion that mimics <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s own reconception of his work 
                            (see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/samuel_rogers_note.php");?>" target="_self">Samuel Rogers &#x005B;1763&#x2013;1855&#x005D;</a>).</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">(<span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s expenditure of 28/6 leaves in doubt what sort of object he acquired. The price of separate proofs, according to <span class="persName-WGR">Rawlinson</span>, 
                                ranged from &#x00A3;2/12/6 for Imperial 4<sup>o</sup> to &#x00A3;3/13/6&#x2013;4/4/0 for Colombier with or without lettering. The cost 
                                of a copy of the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY1830"><i>Italy</i></span> ranged

                        served its purpose by repeatedly capping its goals until the project was rendered obsolete by publication of poems derived from it, announcing the emergence of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s 
                        first significant public persona, <span class="persName-pen_name-JR">&#x201C;J.R.&#x201D;</span></div>
                  
                  <div class="p">The hypothesis advanced here is that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> developed the work in fairly distinct stages, from a verse travelogue 
                        in the eighteenth&#x2010;century topographical manner&#x2014;as represented by <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG1">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span>, 
                        a collaboration with <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>&#x2014;to a composite&#x2010;genre, illustrated travelogue that reflected the material culture 
                        surrounding the ekphrastic and travel&#x2010;related publishing of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. 
                        Finally, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> found himself being brought forward as a published author, credited with two works in the fashionable 
                        <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/annuals_note.php");?>" target="_self">literary and artistic annual</a>,

                        To form one of these published works, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRFRAGMENTS">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                        he revised a pair of poems selected from <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>. The title suggests a reversion 
                        to the initial conception of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> as a verse sequence. To form the second work, 
                        the topographical and travel poem, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                        he did not adapt material directly from the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, but he deployed strategies learned from the ekphrastic and composite&#x2010;genre character 
                        of the work&#x02BC;s advanced stage of composition. Draft of <span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span> also reveals <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        venturing to define a persona behind the initials <span class="persName-pen_name-JR">J.R.</span> attached to the published poems.</div>

                            its in&#x2010;line and interlinear insertions, deletions, substitutions, transposition of lines, and other revisions are incorporated into the

                            and on the fact that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s sequence of drafting the prose essays that correspond to the five poems, as witnessed in the 
                            <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft, necessarily situates the <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span> texts 
                            as existing prior to both the drafts and the fair copies of these essays (see <a href="#COMPOSITEILLUSTRATEDTRAVELOGUEDRAFT">Drafting the Composite&#x2010;Genre Travelogue &#x005B;MS VII, VIII, XI&#x005D;</a>).</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">I interpret this manuscript as witnessing an all&#x2010;verse version of the travelogue, composed with some degree of collaboration by father and son. 
                            As discussed in <a href="#DATEOFCOMPOSITION">Date of Composition</a>, the manuscript is undated, and it remains an open question whether it was composed during 
                            the <span class="date-1833-05-1833-09">May&#x2013;September 1833</span> journey itself, or following the family&#x02BC;s return home around <span class="date-1833-09-20">20 September</span>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">The recto of sheet 1 of the manuscript begins with the poem, <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</span>, entitled as such, 
                            and in the hand of <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>. On the verso, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> continued with the poem, 
                            <span class="title-poem-JRCASSEL">&#x005B;&#x201C;Cassel&#x201D;&#x005D;</span> (untitled, and therefore identifiable as a new poem following 
                            <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</span> only on the grounds of the two poems&#x02BC; separation in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> 
                            fair copy). At line 19 of <span class="title-poem-JRCASSEL">&#x005B;&#x201C;Cassel&#x201D;&#x005D;</span>, <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s hand takes over 
                            (not <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s, whose terminal letters are typically formed differently than what prevails here). 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> carries the poem onto sheet 2 of the manuscript (evidence, along with their physical similarity, that the two sheets 
                            form a single manuscript), filling recto and verso with the continuation of <span class="title-poem-JRCASSEL">&#x005B;&#x201C;Cassel&#x201D;&#x005D;</span>, 
                            <span class="title-poem-JRLILLE">&#x201C;Lille&#x201D;</span>, <span class="title-poem-JRBRUSSELS">&#x201C;Brussels&#x201D;</span>, and 
                            <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMEUSE">&#x201C;The Meuse&#x201D;</span>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">The physical manuscript bears the appearance of a self&#x2010;standing fair copy, which was later subjected to revision. No other extant manuscript belonging to the 
                            <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> project consists solely of verse, and the arrangement of lines on the page indicates 
                            more care than in a draft. On sheet 1, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s large, eighteenth&#x2010;century hand takes up the full width of the paper for each line, 
                            and <span class="persName-JR">John</span> sustained his father&#x02BC;s single column, but in narrower scope and a smaller hand. On the verso of sheet 2, however, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">John</span> stacked the lines in double columns, as if imitating printed verse (although he inserted the final poem in the sequence, 
                            <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMEUSE">&#x201C;The Meuse&#x201D;</span>, sideways in space remaining on the recto of sheet 2, 
                            rather than starting a third sheet). The few substitutions&#x2014;all apparently in <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s hand, 
                            although not certainly so, especially in the case of overwriting&#x2014;are mostly interlinear, made as strikethroughs with insertions above or below the line, 
                            with only a few instances as in&#x2010;line revisions, suggesting that these changes formed a distinct stage of this manuscript&#x02BC;s development, 
                            following its original purpose as a fair copy. Moreover, in the margins of both sheets, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> numbered the lines of the poems sequentially and continuously (1&#x2013;173); 
                            that is, he did not begin his line numbering anew with each poem, suggesting that he regarded the poems as forming a sequence.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">It is possible that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> originally authored <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</span> 
                            and at least the first 18 lines of <span class="title-poem-JRCASSEL">&#x005B;&#x201C;Cassel&#x201D;&#x005D;</span>, which are in his hand, and that <span class="persName-JR">John</span> 
                            thereafter took over the composition, revising some of his <span class="persName-JJR">father</span>&#x02BC;s lines in the process. This scenario cannot be absolutely proven, 
                            but neither can <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s assumption that sheet 1 of the manuscript 
                            bears witness to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;copy&#x201D; of <span class="persName-JR">his son</span>&#x02BC;s original verse 
                            (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE");?>" target="_self">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, e.g. 2:341 n. 2). On the evidence of substitutions in 
                            <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s hand, it is notable that in&#x2010;line revisions occur solely in lines written originally in his hand, 
                            whereas his revisions of lines written originally in <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s hand occur solely as interlinear or overwriting, 
                            possibly suggesting that <span class="persName-JR">John</span> had no part in a first stage of composing this sheet.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Further research is required to gauge the extent and nature of <span class="persName-JJR">father</span> and <span class="persName-JR">son</span>&#x02BC;s collaboration. 
                            It is at least evident that the material witness of this manuscript indicates some degree of poetic collaboration by father and son, 
                            and it is noteworthy that this collaboration took place within the frame of the Augustan verse travelogues that prevailed in <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s youth, 
                            rather than the manner of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>, <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>, <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>, 
                            <span class="persName-CJHD">Dickens</span>, and the jobbing prose writers that dominated the scene during <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s first decade as an author. 
                            In effect, this sequence of five poems stands vis&#x2010;à&#x2010;vis the composite&#x2010;genre work that the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> became,

                            which incorporates its corrections and substitutions in the prose essay, <span class="title-essay-JRCALAISPROSE">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</span>,

                            <span class="title-poem-JRMILANCATHEDRAL">&#x201C;Milan Cathedral&#x201D;</span>, the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy 
                            having been abandoned toward the end of sections describing the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> journey, before the sequence could arrive at the 
                            crossing of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>. The manuscript&#x02BC;s place in the evolution of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> 
                            appears to be a transitional one between the all&#x2010;verse and the fully developed composite&#x2010;genre versions, 
                            since it contains a mix of genres (albeit no graphic illustrations) as well as a selection of works about destinations that seems strategically chosen. 
                            The audience and occasion of the manuscript will, however, probably always remain obscure.</div>

                            suggests that these works served as imaginative and compositional cruxes for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>. The pairing of the poems 
                            <span class="title-poem-JRANDERNACHT">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</span> and <span class="title-poem-JRSTGOAR">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</span> 
                            was formed around a contrast of gothic sublime and domestic beauty, respectively, that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> carried forward to the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> 
                            fair copy (in which he elaborated the pairing with a third, middle section, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/ehrenbreitstein_poem_msix.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-composite-JREHRENBREITSTEINCOMP">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                            designed to bridge the contrasting modes using a geographical analogy of a confluence of two rivers, the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> and the 
                            <span class="geogName-MOSELLE">Moselle</span>). Ultimately, he refined the pairing for publication under the title, <span class="title-poem-JRFRAGMENTS">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</span> 
                            (see <a href="#PUBLICATION1834">Publication: <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> (November 1834)</a>).

                            that of crossing a divide between natural and supernatural phenomena. The figure of a crossing that is humanly transformative appears to have been suggested to him 
                            by <span class="persName-SR">Samuel Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s poem, <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</span>,

                            even though the labor of assembling and fair&#x2010;copying these particular sections lay far ahead in the process 
                            (given that, in the sequence of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft, these prose essays are succeeded by other draft essays that

                            Then, in another compositional crux, immediately after composing the prose essays <span class="title-essay-JRANDERNACHTPROSE">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</span> and

                            (see <a href="#MENTORS">Discussion: Mentors</a>). It was likely because he was distracted by the opportunity to publish in

                            that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> abandoned the fair&#x2010;copying, leaving the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> version incomplete

                            since the fair copy incorporates his revisions to those manuscripts; and he likely commenced fair&#x2010;copying not long before <span class="date-1834-02">February 1834</span>, 
                            when he started the stint of draft in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>&#x2014;the sequence of that draft gradually

                            never made a drawing to fill them, and which are empty because, as he commented in <span class="date-1885">1885</span> in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>,

                            Since the blank versos facing each of these seven pages obviously would have been inadequate to contain verse and prose of the length that fills the earlier,

                            did not place these drawings with the intention of flowing text around them. Rather, he or someone else at some time prior to <span class="date-1903">1903</span> decided 
                            that no more fair&#x2010;copying would be forthcoming, and that the remaining blank pages may as well be used in part to assemble this gallery.

                            Twenty&#x2010;eight is an accurate count of the drawings presently in place in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>, if the gallery of eight unidentified vignettes is included. Given that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> published his catalogue

The known tour sketches are listed in <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/drawings_1833_note.php");?>" target="_self">Drawings from the Tour of 1833</a>. A representative example of such drawings survives 
                            in a sheet of pen&#x2010;and&#x2010;ink drawings made by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in connection with the <span class="date-1833">1833</span> journey,

                            The sheet contains five landscape views (plus an architectural subject on the verso), each of which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> captioned according to their respective locales. These captions, which are inscribed in a cursive hand, 
                            and which follow the curve of the base of a sketch as if forming a part of it, closely resemble the caption used to entitle another drawing from the <span class="date-1833">1833</span> tour, 
                            <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#JRBALSTALLANDMONTBLANC");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-artwork-JRBALSTALL1833">&#x201C;Ancient Fortress and Rocky peak. / Above the vale of <span class="placeName-BALSTHAL">Balstall &#x005B;i.e., Balsthal&#x005D;</span>, <span class="geogName-JURA">Jura</span>&#x201D;</span></a>,

                            The caption feature, along with some other consistencies of style peculiar to the <span class="date-1833">1833</span> sketches, is revealing, since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> reworked 
                            <span class="title-artwork-JRBALSTALL1833">&#x201C;Ancient Fortress and Rocky Peak&#x201D;</span> to form a readily identifiable vignette among those included in the gallery at the end of <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>,

The latter version, like all of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s vignettes, 
                            lacks a caption, since he recognized that the vignette form seeks a more integrated and imaginative relation with text than the distinctness of an illustrative plate with its lettering of title, artist, 
                            and engraver (a stage of production separate from the engraving of the image itself). Thus, we are provided with a basis for distinguishing tour sketches, like those in the 
                            <span class="placeName-BOSTON">Boston</span> sheet, from drawings that 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intended specifically to insert into the fair&#x2010;copy <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>&#x2014;even though 
                            as <span class="persName-PHW">Walton</span> remarks, the tour sketches themselves resemble &#x201C;school copies rather than records of things seen, and . . . were probably elaborated 
                            in hotel rooms or at home&#x201D; (p. 14).</div>

                            is 8 1/2 &#x00D7; 5 inches, as compared with the Boston sheet at 9 1/16 &#x00D7; 11 9/16 inches, but the former contains two mountain scenes stacked vertically, 
                            whereas the latter holds five mountain sketches (plus a smaller undeveloped architectural subject) arranged horizontally. One can imagine <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            cutting the five smaller drawings into separate slips and inserting them directly as vignettes into <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>, 
                            but the presence of a caption seems to be decisive in distinguishing these <span class="date-1833">1833</span> tour sketches from vignettes intended for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, 
                            as well as differences in size and style. For the approximately 8 &#x00D7; 6 1/2&#x2013;inch <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> ledger (see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/msix_apparatus.php#DESCRIPTION");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>: Description</a>), 
                            many of the tour drawings would have required a full page or exceeded its limits. While <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did use full or nearly full page spaces in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> for his imitations of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span> lithographs, 
                            thereby registering the much larger dimensions of the originals relative to the exquisite steel&#x2010;engraved vignettes after <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> that he imitated from <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY1830"><i><span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span></i></span> 
                            (see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#HANSONRUSKIN1830S");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-DCH">Hanson</span>, &#x201C;<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>&#x201D;</a>), 
                            he considerably scaled down <span class="title-artwork-JRBALSTALL1833">&#x201C;Ancient Fortress and Rocky Peak&#x201D;</span> for its vignette version. There are also 
                            distinct differences in drawing style between the tour sketches and the vignettes. <span class="persName-PHW">Walton</span> characterizes the tour sketches as &#x201C;composed with schematic distinctions of tone and form from plane to plane 
                            in an eighteenth&#x2010;century manner that probably derived from <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/runciman_charles_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-CR">&#x005B;Charles&#x005D; Runciman</span></a>&#x201D; (p. 14). The vignettes&#x2014;at 
                            least the later, recognizably <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x2010;influenced vignettes, as exemplifed by the transformation of 
                            <span class="title-artwork-JRBALSTALL1833">&#x201C;Ancient Fortress and Rocky Peak&#x201D;</span> into

                            that frames the sketches; and they use Turneresque lighting effects to suffuse and lend drama to the orderly, restrained planar logic of the sketches.</div>

                            While the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> sequence does represent the most extensive development of the composite&#x2010;genre version to survive in draft, 
                            <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> neglected to analyze how this manuscript must have been preceded by <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG1">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span> 
                            and <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG2">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span> in the genetic development of the work, even though he was familiar with these other manuscripts. 
                            Yet <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not, it is true, simply pick up in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> 
                            where he had left off composing verse and prose for the composite&#x2010;genre version in previous extant manuscripts. By starting the draft 
                            in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> with the <span class="title-essay-JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</span>, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was casting forward to a projected conclusion of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>&#x2014;a 
                            complement to beginning <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span> with a prose essay,

                     <div class="p">The prose essay headed by the title <span class="title-essay-JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</span> describes an episode that occurred 
                            at the end of the Ruskins&#x02BC; tour, during their stay in <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</span>. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> probably meant the title 
                            to apply also to the untitled poem following the essay, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/i_woke_to_hear_the_lullaby_poem_msviii.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY">&#x201C;I woke to hear the lullaby&#x201D;</span> &#x005B;&#x201C;The Arve at Chamouni&#x201D;&#x005D;</a>. 
                            As <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> correctly indicates by his invented title, &#x201C;The Arve at Chamouni&#x201D;, 
                            the poem describes the <span class="geogName-ARVE">Arve River</span> flowing through the valley of <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</span>. 
                            In other words, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intended this opening title of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> draft 
                            as a section heading for prose and verse&#x2014;a unit in the already fully developed composite version of the work. 
                            This increased complexity in composition at the start of the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft is significant, 
                            not only as additional proof that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> initiated this stint at a stage when he had already conceived of 
                            the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> as a composite&#x2010;genre work, but also as an indication 
                            of the design and thematic coherence he imagined for the work&#x2014;albeit a plan that he never completed the fair copy.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">The hike to the glacier source of the <span class="geogName-ARVERON">Arveron River</span> was a popular activity for tourists in <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</span>. 
                            In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s telling, the excursion suggests a quest for poetic origins: led by local children acting as guides, 
                            the walk to the &#x201C;source&#x201D; reveals a <span class="name--HIPPOCRENE">Hippocrene</span>&#x2010;like, spiritual place of inspiration. 
                            In this notion of a spiritual poetic source, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drew together multiple ideas, including the trope of crossing mountains 
                            into a sacred bourne, a theme that he had already broached in draft of <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span>, 
                            based on <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/rogers_samuel_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-SR">Samuel Rogers</span></a>&#x02BC;s 
                            <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</span> in <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>. 
                            Moreover, as explained in <a href="#SOURCES">Discussion: Sources and Influences</a> and <a href="#MENTORS">Mentors</a>, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s recent correspondence in <span class="date-1834-02-13">mid&#x2010;February 1834</span> with the writer <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/hogg_james_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-JH">James Hogg</span> (ca. 1770&#x2013;1835)</a>, 
                            who had invited the youth to his farm in the <span class="geogName-YARROWVALLEY">Yarrow Valley</span> of the <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scottish Borders</span> 
                            as an act of poetic mentoring, prompted in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> a pastoral &#x201C;reverie&#x201D; about poetry and place. 
                            It is owing to this spiritualization of the journey at the start of the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft that a thematic case can be made 
                            for counting <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/oh_are_there_spirits_can_there_be_poem_msviii.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JROARETHERESPIRITS">&#x201C;Oh are there spirits, can there be&#x201D;</span></a>,

                     <div class="p">The convergence of these themes suggests a date of <span class="date-1834-02-13-1834-02-28">mid&#x2010; to late&#x2010;February 1834</span>

                            which contains the corresponding pair of <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> journey poems as well as the pair of poems introducing the trope of mountain crossing,

                     <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> carried on in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> to develop the trope of mountain crossing

                            a cluster that, according to the <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-bibliography_text-">List of Proposed Additional Contents for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span></a>,

                            It appears that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intended <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span> to serve 
                            as a fulcrum between a cluster of pieces about the approach to the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> from <span class="placeName-SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</span>, 
                            and a cluster about the crossing at <span class="geogName-SPLUGEN">Splügen</span>. The latter cluster was to consist of pieces or composite sections entitled

                            all of which are represented by poems in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft (see

                            on the experience of crossing, rather than a prospective one as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> planned, but it is clear that the younger poet modeled his sequence 
                            on <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s approach to the mountains. (In <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, 
                            the approach plays out topographically coming from the west, in the poems <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEGREATSTBERNARD">&#x201C;The Great St. Bernard&#x201D;</span> and 
                            <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEDESCENT">&#x201C;The Descent&#x201D;</span>, rather than coming from the north as the Ruskins did.) 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poems lack the pedantic historical references with which <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> 
                            labors his verse; instead, the youth (who was in any case inadequately learned to make such allusions) allowed the verse to unfold by tracing the landscape itself, 
                            coupling the description, if with anything, with a reverential topic, such as the sabbath setting of

                            accords well with a trajectory of this writing toward a terminus ad quem among the drafts of poetry preparing for his father&#x02BC;s 
                            <span class="date-1834-05-10">10 May 1834</span> birthday. As the sequence of <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> draft 
                            proceeds from poems about mountain crossings to poems about <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>, the ongoing intermixing of draft relating to points 
                            in northern Europe suggests that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s drafting was gradually converging with his fair&#x2010;copying in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>. 
                            Growing prominent toward the end of the main stint of draft for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>

                            are draft pieces related to the break&#x2010;off point of the fair copy in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>&#x2014;<span class="title-composite-JRHEIDELBERGCOMP">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</span>,

                     <div class="p">At some points in the text, one can detect the traces of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> pivoting between draft and fair copy. On page 62r of 
                            <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, three&#x2010;quarters of the way down the page, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            started the prose essay, <span class="title-essay-JRBRUSSELSPROSE">&#x201C;Brussels&#x201D;</span>, entitling it 
                            <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/part_of_brussels_prose1_msviii.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-JRBRUSSELSPROSE1_MSVIII">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; &#x005B;part 1&#x005D;</span></a>. This draft extends halfway through 62v, 
                            where it stops in mid&#x2010;sentence, with the word &#x201C;circumnavigating&#x201D; substituted for <span class="del-strikethrough">traversing</span>. At this point, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> stopped to compose a poem, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/oh_softly_blew_the_morning_breeze_poem_msviii.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRJROHSOFTLYBLEW">&#x201C;Oh softly blew the mounting breeze&#x201D; &#x005B;&#x201C;Chiavenna&#x201D;&#x005D;</span></a>; 
                            and then, at the top of the next recto, 63r, he completed the prose essay, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/part_of_brussels_prose2_msviii.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-JRBRUSSELSPROSE2_MSVIII">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; &#x005B;part 2&#x005D;</span></a>, 
                            which he took up in mid&#x2010;sentence, with the phrase &#x201C;perambulating . . . tread on it softly&#x201D;. In the <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/brussels_prose_msix.php");?>" target="_self">fair copy of this prose passage</a>, 
                            a line of text ends with the break&#x2010;point in the draft of <span class="title-essay-JRBRUSSELSPROSE1_MSVIII">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; &#x005B;part 1&#x005D;</span>, 
                            &#x201C;circumnavigating for&#x201D;&#x2014;with the &#x201C;for&#x201D; jammed against the justified right margin. The next line resumes as in 
                            <span class="title-essay-JRBRUSSELSPROSE2_MSVIII">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; &#x005B;part 2&#x005D;</span>: &#x201C;perambulating.&#x2014;Oh woe to the weather&#x201D;. 
                            One might infer, then, that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> fair&#x2010;copied <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/part_of_brussels_prose1_msviii.php");?>" target="_self">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; &#x005B;part 1&#x005D;</a> in 
                            <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> as far as he had drafted the prose in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> (62v); 
                            crossed out the last word in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft on 62v (&#x201C;<span class="del-strikethrough">traversing</span>&#x201D;), 
                            since he could not fit that word on the line in the fair copy (hence, the tightly fitted, almost run&#x2010;together &#x201C;circumnavigating, for&#x201D;); 
                            then perhaps stopped fair&#x2010;copying the prose in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>, in order to compose the poem about <span class="placeName-CHIAVENNA">Chiavenna</span> that falls next 
                            in draft; and finally resumed drafting prose with <span class="title-essay-JRBRUSSELSPROSE2_MSVIII">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; &#x005B;part 2&#x005D;</span>, 
                            only changing his mind about the next word (making it &#x201C;perambulating&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;traversing&#x201D;).</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Perhaps close to the time when composing and fair&#x2010;copying converged, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> turned to the back endpapers 
                            of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> to begin the first of two lists constituting the 
                            <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-bibliography_text-">List of Proposed Additional Contents for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span></a>&#x2014;the 
                            list of the remaining place&#x2010;name sections yet to be drafted and/or fair&#x2010;copied for the completed work 
                            (see <a href="#PROPOSEDCONTENTS">The Plan for Completion of the Work</a>). At the start of this first list, 
                            he identified sections connected with points along the lower <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>, places about which he had perhaps recently drafted, or was in process of drafting, verse and prose. 
                            The list is headed by <span class="title-composite-JRANDERNACHTCOMP">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</span> and 
                            <span class="title-composite-JRSTGOARCOMP">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</span>, which were nothing new, but they are now separated by

                            conceived, apparently belatedly, to act as a bridge between the complementary sections. Then, after deleting a proposed section about <span class="placeName-FRANKFURT">Frankfurt</span> 
                            (<span class="title-composite-JRFRANKFURTCOMP">&#x201C;<span class="placeName-FRANKFURT">Francfurt</span>&#x201D;</span>), 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> listed <span class="title-composite-JRHEIDELBERGCOMP">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</span>, and

                     <div class="p">In the first list, several other proposed place&#x2010;name sections correspond to verse and prose pieces drafted in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>&#x2014;pieces 
                            describing, for example, the Alpine border between <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span> and <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>, 
                            and places in <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> and <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span>. Many of these draft pieces 
                            were edited for inclusion in the two earliest published versions of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> that claimed to represent the work 
                            comprehensively&#x2014;<a href="#PUBLICATION1891"><i>Poems</i>, ed. Collingwood (1891)</a>

                            neglected to explain what guidance, if any, they took from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s

                            The first published version to schematize these surviving draft pieces explicitly and fully according to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s plan is the

                     <div class="p">Finally, respecting the fugitive pieces of writing contained in <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/msvii_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span></a> and 
                            <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/msxi_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span></a> that were originally intended for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, 
                            little can be inferred about their respective draft stages, since no earlier witnesses are extant. The texts are unique and fair&#x2010;copied in an unidentified hand 
                            (see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/hand_note.php#UNIDENTIFIEDMSSVII_XI");?>" target="_self">The Ruskin Family Handwriting: Unidentified Hands&#x2014;MS VII, XI Fair Copy of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span></a>). 
                            That the hand is probably not <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s, and that the fair copies were made without his involvement, can be inferred from some bizarre 
                            instances of diction and punctuation that seem most logically explained as errors in transcription 
                            (see textual glosses for the poems <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/the_rhine_poem_msvii.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHERHINE">&#x201C;The Rhine&#x201D;</span></a> and

                            made long after <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drafted the original texts, and after he had abandoned the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> 
                            as a project, since the copies are found among a group of texts&#x2014;all transcribed in the same unidentified hand, which worked from the opposite end of the original use of 
                            <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span>&#x2014;which includes items originally dating from <span class="date-1836">1836</span>. The purpose of transcribing these disparate texts 
                            together and at the same time is unknown, but the copyist signified his or her awareness of the texts&#x02BC; respective provenances by adding the dateline &#x201C;1833&#x201D; 
                            at the bottom of two poems originating with the <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/tour_of_1833_note.php");?>" target="_self">Tour of 1833</a>&#x2014;<span class="title-poem-JRTHERHINE">&#x201C;The Rhine&#x201D;</span>

                            continuously, 1&#x2013;173, without breaks between the separate poems. In <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG2">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span>, 
                            the line numbering begins following the prose essay, <span class="title-essay-JRCALAISPROSE">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</span>, 
                            starting with the first line of <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span> as line 360, 
                            and running continuously from poem to poem, to line 429. Since the poems in this manuscript, unlike those in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG1">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span>, 
                            could never have been conceived as sequentially ordered in a topographical sense for fair copy, this instance shows that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            did not employ the system in the course of composition to keep track of a topographical ordering of sections. Nonetheless, the numbering may have been useful to him 
                            when transferring draft to fair copy in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">In the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft sequence, the line numbering takes up with line 506, applied to 
                            <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/oh_are_there_spirits_can_there_be_poem_msviii.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JROHARETHERESPIRITS">&#x201C;Oh are there spirits, can there be&#x201D;</span></a>; 
                            and the numbering carries relentlessly and mechanically forward through the verse draft in <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/ms_viii_apparatus.php#CONTENTS");?>" target="_self">MS VIII: Contents, Section <i>b</i></a>, 
                            albeit with occasional gaps or overlapping numbering. 
                            Where poetry encounters prose on the page, the line numbering halts, and then resumes sequentially following the interruption. 
                            As in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG2">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span>, the line numbering in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> 
                            bears no relation to the topographical sequence, which is jumbled, with poems drafted in no particular geographical order (except for the occasional topographical cluster), 
                            and with some poems such as <span class="title-poem-JRHEIDELBERG">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</span> and <span class="title-poem-JRGENOA">&#x201C;Genoa&#x201D;</span> 
                            divided into parts separated by several pages with no effect on the numbering sequence. Thus, in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> as well, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s numbering the lines of poetry seems mechanical. Doubtless, he needed a line count in order to estimate 
                            the space needed to fair&#x2010;copy lines; however, the system would not have helped him estimate space for prose, and the presence of the numbering in 
                            <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG1">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span> suggests that he initiated the numbering scheme before he even conceived 
                            the composite&#x2010;genre version represented by the fair copy.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Nonetheless, the line numbering can be used to corroborate other evidence in drawing conclusions about the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>. 
                            For example, the onset of the numbering in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> with line 506 seems strong evidence for treating the poem 
                            <span class="title-poem-JROHARETHERESPIRITS">&#x201C;Oh are there spirits, can there be&#x201D;</span> as a part of the work, especially 
                            since this evidence supports the thematic relevance of the poem. At the opposite end of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> 
                            draft in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, the continuous line numbering ends at line 1484, the final line of the poem 
                            <span class="title-poem-JRVILLAPLINIANA">&#x201C;Villa Pliniana&#x201D;</span>; and on the following recto, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            started line numbering anew with line 1 for the start of <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span></a>. 
                            The latter poem, as argued in <a href="#PUBLICATION1834">Publication: <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> (November 1834)</a>, marks his departure from the 
                            <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> per se, to prepare for publication in <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">The line numbering does not, however, supply foolproof evidence that poems comprised within the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>

                            This poem is simultaneously numbered starting with line 1, using the column on the opposite side of the page from the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> numbering, 
                            suggesting either that the poem bears a tangential relation to the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, 
                            or that the line numbering system served an additional purpose to counting lines for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, 
                            or that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> sometimes numbered the ruled lines on the page ahead of composing and was merely careless 
                            about using those pre&#x2010;numbered lines for other kinds of poetry.</div>

                            a list that he began with <span class="title-composite-JRANDERNACHTCOMP">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</span>, <span class="title-composite-JREHRENBREITSTEINCOMP">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D;</span>, 
                            and <span class="title-composite-JRSTGOARCOMP">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</span> as items numbered 1&#x2013;3. Thus, it appears that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> began the list 
                            roughly at the point when his fair&#x2010;copying of these pieces in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> converged with the pace of his drafting remaining portions of those sections in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>

                            This inference tends to be confirmed by the deletion of number 4 in the list, a proposed entry for <span class="title-composite-JRFRANKFURTCOMP">&#x201C;Francfurt&#x201D;</span>, 
                            which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> must have reconsidered while both the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft and <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy were in process, 
                            since the fair copy proceeds from <span class="title-composite-JRSTGOARCOMP">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</span> to <span class="title-composite-JRHEIDELBERGCOMP">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</span>, 
                            number 5 in the list, with no fair copy of a section about <span class="placeName-FRANKFURT">Frankfurt</span>. (Also no draft related to <span class="placeName-FRANKFURT">Frankfurt</span> is found in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>&#x2014;or. at least, no draft that is recognizable as such. 
                            A draft might have existed elsewhere that did not survive. <span class="placeName-FRANKFURT">Frankfurt</span> was nonetheless a major destination along the route, where the family stopped <span class="date-1833-06-01-1833-06-03">June 1&#x2013;3</span>,

                     <div class="p">List 2 arranges place&#x2010;names correspondingly to the first, and associates with each place&#x2010;name a set of illustrations that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intended to copy

                            when abandoning fair copy in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> therefore began this second list somewhat later than the first, 
                            which he evidently started before he had completed drafting and/or fair&#x2010;copying <span class="title-composite-JRANDERNACHTCOMP">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</span>, <span class="title-composite-JREHRENBREITSTEINCOMP">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D;</span>,

                            either at the time he stopped fair&#x2010;copying or any time afterward, but a terminus a quo is established by the source of the illustrations planned for 
                            <span class="title-composite-JRHEIDELBERGCOMP">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</span>, which can be identified with near certainty as

                                for each place&#x2010;name. At the same time, these lists constituted a work&#x2010;in&#x2010;progress, as shown by 
                                <a href="#account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_pcs_corpus_strasburgcomp"><span class="title-composite-JRSTRASBURGCOMP">&#x201C;<span class="placeName-STRASBOURG">Strasburg</span>&#x201D;</span></a> and

                                which are listed separately in list 1 but evidently combined in list 2. In <i>ERM</i>, it is assumed that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> meant 
                                the place&#x2010;name titles in lists 1 and 2 to be in keeping with the existing composite sections in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </div>
                     
                     <div class="p">In the transcription of <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-bibliography_text-">Lists of Proposed Additional Contents</span></a>, 
                            list 2 is transcribed as Table 2, consisting of four columns.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">
                        <ul>
                           
                           <li>Column 2.<i>a</i> carries <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s own column header, the term &#x201C;wanted&#x201D;. This header is followed by a column of numbers, 
                                a digit for each section. But what specifically did <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> mean to enumerate as <i>wanting</i>? If the number pertains to his list 
                                of proposed figures for each section (column 2.<i>c</i>), then perhaps it signifies how many more sources or ideas for illustrations he believed he required, if any, 
                                in order to enhance each section adequately. (The minimum would have been two&#x2014;a header and a footer for each section&#x2014;and the maximum typically four: 
                                using the fair&#x2010;copied <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("corpuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix_corpus_calais.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-composite-JRCALAISCOMP">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</span></a> 
                                as a standard for a section, the poem and the essay could each have its own header and footer, for a total of four, although the limit was truly bounded only by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s imagination and ambition.) 
                                Alternatively, the number of items <i>wanting</i> might refer to how many of the ideas in column 2.<i>c</i> remained to be actually carried out with drawings.<br/><br/> 
                                Unfortunately, since some drawings he did complete may no longer be extant, any conclusion based on the numbers in column 2.<i>a</i> is checked 
                                by uncertainty owing not only to the current state of <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>, but also to the point at which he happened to note the number, since he could have produced a drawing subsequently 
                                (see also <a href="#CURATORIALTREATMENT">Information about the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; Lost owing to Curatorial Treatment of Manuscripts</a>). 
                                An example of these ambiguities is the zero in column 2.<i>a</i> next to <span class="title-composite-JRHEIDELBERGCOMP">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</span> 
                                (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php#ACCOUNTTOCHEIDELBERGILLUS");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-bibliography_text-JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">List of Proposed Additional Contents &#x005B;Table 2, Illustrations&#x005D;</span></a>), 
                                which might indicate that no more ideas for illustrations were wanted than the five listed. Indeed, five would surely have sufficed, but what are we to make of the drawing already in place 
                                in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> as the header of that section (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/heidelberg_drawing_msix.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-artwork-JRHEIDELBERGDRAWINGMSIX"><i>Vignette, Mountain Prospect Drawing &#x005B;<span class="geogName-HEILIGENBERG">Heiligenberg</span>?&#x005D;</i></span></a>)? 
                                Does that drawing make a sixth? It does not correspond to any of the topics that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> lists here, least of all a &#x201C;Tournament&#x201D; picture with which he was to &#x201C;begin&#x201D;, according to this entry. 
                                But does <i>begin</i> refer to the section itself or to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s work plan, which would have resumed with <span class="title-composite-JRHEIDELBERGCOMP">&#x201C;<span class="placeName-HEIDELBERG">Heidelberg</span>&#x201D;</span>? 
                                Could the existing drawing in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> be merely misplaced? (The relation to <span class="placeName-HEIDELBERG">Heidelberg</span> to the landscape it depicts is in fact questionable; see the figure caption for 
                                <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/heidelberg_drawing_msix.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-artwork-JRHEIDELBERGDRAWINGMSIX"><i>Vignette, Mountain Prospect Drawing &#x005B;<span class="geogName-HEILIGENBERG">Heiligenberg</span>?&#x005D;</i></span></a>.) 
                                Thus, any speculation based on the numbers in this column must entail some doubt. A degree of assurance may be achieved, however, by working out a possible relation 
                                between the numbers in this column and those in column 2.<i>d</i>.</li><br/><br/>
                           
                           <li>Column 2.<i>b</i> transcribes <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s proposed titles, which for the most part match those in column 1.<i>c</i>. As in the case of 
                                <a href="#account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_pcs_corpus_strasburgcomp"><span class="title-composite-JRSTRASBURGCOMP">&#x201C;<span class="placeName-STRASBOURG">Strasburg</span>&#x201D;</span></a> and

                                a difference between the two lists can indicate a change of mind.</li><br/><br/>
                           
                           <li>Column 2.<i>c</i> transcribes <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s proposed illustrations for each section. Contextual notes attached to the entries attempt to identify the sources of the proposed illustrations.</li><br/><br/>
                           
                           <li>Column 2.<i>d</i> transcribes another set of numbers, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> attached to some lists of proposed illustrations. 
                                Again, the meaning of these numbers requires interpretation, but presumably they stand in some relation to those in column 2.<i>a</i>. 
                                One possibility may be that, if the numbers in column 2.<i>a</i> give a total of proposed illustrations &#x201C;wanted&#x201D;, these in column 2.<i>d</i> 
                                indicate the number of illustrations completed.</li>

                     <div class="p">There seems no sure way to tell whether <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> compiled the two lists all at once in a short time or developed them over a lengthy duration. 
                            The physical arrangement of the columns on the endpapers indicates that list 1 must have existed prior to list 2, as borne out by the evidence already noted of the later, <span class="date-1834-06">June 1834</span> terminus a quo for the start of list 2. 
                            (Both lists appear to have wrapped around the pen&#x2010;and&#x2010;ink drawing of mountains on the verso, whereas the position of the box on the recto, 
                            containing a note concerning a &#x201C;Birthday poem&#x201D;, might have been added at any time.) One clue about the development of list 1 may lie in the checkmarks 
                            to the left of some place&#x2010;names, which appear to designate that those places were already represented by individual poems 
                            in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> and <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span> draft. 
                            Notably, two items in the list that are <i>not</i> checked are <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/cadenabbia_poem_msviii.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-">&#x201C;Cadenabbia&#x201D;</span></a> and

                            final two poetry drafts that Ruskin composed in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> before he interrupted work on the 
                            <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> with draft of

                            Thus, if <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> included these two destinations in list 1 prior to drafting their respective poems, 
                            he must have compiled the list in a fairly brief period between when he completed and fair&#x2010;copied the sections at the start of the list

                            In none of these did the editors make clear the authority for their texts. Overall, however, the successive published versions may be said steadily 
                            to have approached realization of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s intentions for his final version, had he completed such a version himself.

                            published texs. Only the <span class="date-1902">1903</span> edition conveyed an idea of the composite&#x2010;genre version 
                            as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> conceived it, but that edition is incompletely realized, and for many of its choices it relies uncritically on the <span class="date-1891">1891</span> edition.

                            on the strength of his clever imitation of illustrated travel literature in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>. That the two commissions came 
                            close together is suggested, moreover, by the probable timing of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s fair&#x2010;copying of the

                            Since the fair&#x2010;copy texts of the poems for these sections remain largely unchanged from their first instantiation in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG2">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span>, 
                            presumably their revision for <span class="title-poem-JRFRAGMENTS">&#x201C;Fragments&#x201D;</span> had not yet been undertaken. This fair&#x2010;copying,

                            was in keeping with the editor&#x02BC;s prior decision to divide publication of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s early works between separate anthologies of poetry and of prose, but that decision in itself uncritically

                            <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> was influenced not only by the unexamined biographical myths that resulted in the market conditions favoring his edition; 
                            he also passed along <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s own habit in later life of referring to the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>

                            Perhaps he would have excerpted selections in an introduction, following his manner of confining the earliest juvenile verse to the &#x201C;Editor&#x02BC;s Introduction&#x201D; 
                            in the edition of the poems. One suspects that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> would have attached little importance to these prose pieces, 
                            in which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> imitates the style of letterpress writers for the illustrated travel literature of his youth, 
                            sometimes adopting the wryly ironic, tendentious tone favored by the livelier of these writers, other times mocking the false pedantry of jobbing writers 
                            who worked up their subject with no experience of the places they described. While <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> did not suppress writing

                            as consistent with the mature author&#x02BC;s mission to elevate &#x201C;the public taste in poetry as well as art&#x201D;; and it was in his poems, 
                            according to the editor, that, &#x201C;although &#x005B;<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x005D; thrust them aside for prose&#x201D;, the youth 
                            &#x201C;could better put the complicated feelings, thoughts, and facts which he had to tell&#x201D;. The poems, therefore, constituted 
                            &#x201C;the best introduction to his later and greater books&#x201D;

                            which could &#x201C;render the very marks of the pencil and strokes of the pen&#x201D;. Thus, to accompany the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>,

                            As a second accompaniment, <span class="title-artwork-JRJUNGFRAUFROMINTERLAKEN"><i>The Jungfrau from <span class="placeName-INTERLAKEN">Interlachen</span></i></span> (<span class="date-1833">1833</span>)

                            Besides contributing to the larger goal of documenting <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s developing drawing style, however, 
                            these plates reveal another intention, less prominently stated but significant for <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s approach to editing

                            and not <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s interest in the technology of printed images. That is, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>

                            In <span class="date-1882">1882</span>, before he even started writing the autobiography, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s stake 
                            in editing the poems had been prompted by the American publisher, John Wiley &#x0026; Sons, stealing a march on reprinting 
                            the poems first published in the annuals, causing him to raise the alarm to <span class="persName-AW">Alexander Wedderburn</span> (7 February 1882 or 1883,

                            It is interesting to speculate how that perceived theft might have helped to sponsor the idea of writing an autobiography, but once he had told his story in that book 
                            and in his own way about his creation of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> and his subsequent publication

                            is credited by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, doubtless apocryphally, with having prompted the family&#x02BC;s tour spontaneously, 
                            whereas the journey must in fact have long been in planning: 
                            &#x201C;as my mother watched my father&#x02BC;s pleasure and mine in looking at the wonderful places, she said, why should we not go and see some of them in reality? 
                            My father hesitated a little, then with glittering eyes said&#x2014;why not? And there were two or three weeks of entirely rapturous and amazed preparation&#x201D;

                            but the portfolio probably did help imaginatively to orient the family to the north of Europe,

                            northern and southern destinations, but also of how those destinations were materially embodied in the illustrated travel writing and publication of

                            provides a pictorial tour through <span class="placeName-BELGIUM">Belgium</span> and <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span> in fifty lithographic prints, 
                            featuring picturesque medieval and Renaissance architectural sites. The book contains no letterpress; the locales depicted are identified only by place names 
                            lettered directly onto the lithographic stone, as part of the image. The lithographs, then a new medium in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>, 
                            would have struck the Ruskins by their dramatically large size (22 by 15 inches) and watercolor&#x2010;like texture. <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s significance for British perceptions of northern Europe lay in the novelty of his representations of towns 
                                in northern <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span>, <span class="placeName-BELGIUM">Belgium</span>, and <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span>. 
                                For British travelers in the <span class="date-1820-1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</span>, emergent developments in touristic experience were perhaps most vivid in new and less familiar routes 
                                opening up in northern Europe alongside the well&#x2010;worn paths of the Grand Tour to <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>. 
                                Whereas travel in the <span class="placeName-PASDECALAIS">Pas&#x2010;de&#x2010;Calais</span> and <span class="placeName-FLANDERS">Flanders</span> was at one time regarded as a route to be got over as quickly as possible on the way to <span class="placeName-PARIS">Paris</span>, 
                                the Grand Tour began to migrate north with the the post&#x2010;war attraction of <span class="placeName-WATERLOO">Waterloo Field</span>, 
                                along with the Romantic interest in <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span>, highlighted by <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> journey

                                <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span> enabled viewers to dwell on this Romantic scenery in <span class="title-artwork-PROUTILLUSTRATIONSRHINE"><i>Illustrations of the Rhine</i></span>, published <span class="date-1822-1826">1822&#x2013;26</span>, 
                                based on an <span class="date-1821">1821</span> tour (see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#LOCKETTPROUT");?>" target="_self">Lockett, <i>Samuel Prout</i></a>, 50&#x2013;53).

                                may well have served as a kind of guidebook for the Ruskins (although of course they could not take a folio volume with them). <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s views would have

                            less picturesque than historical and classically learned. <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s verse and taste were late&#x2010;eighteenth&#x2010;century in manner, 
                            and his <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> could not compete in popularity with

                            exploiting the up&#x2010;to&#x2010;date technologies of steel engraving and mass production that had sponsored the boom in

                            The edition was innovative also in combining an intaglio process&#x2014;its finely etched, steel&#x2010;engraved vignettes (2&#x2013;3 inches by 3&#x2013;4 inches) that illustrate 
                            <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s poems&#x2014;with the relief printing of the poems on the same page. The exquisite vignettes

                                as well as with the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> illustrated version (although, as remarked in <a href="DATEBENCHMARKS">Benchmark Acquisitions of Influential Illustrated Travel Publications</a> 
                                and in <a href="#DATEOFCOMPOSITION">Date of Composition</a>, there is some ambiguity concerning when the family

                            with a landscape vignette above the section title, in order to situate the reader in a distinct place, and by closing each section with a figure vignette as a tailpiece,

                            notable innovation of combining the intaglio effects of the vignette on the same page with the relief type. <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> 
                            probably based his layout on the admired designs by <span class="persName-WBPUBLISHER">William Bulmer</span> (<span class="date-1757-1830">1757&#x2013;1830</span>) 
                            for editions of English poets, published in the <span class="date-1790-1799">1790s</span> by his Shakspeare Press

                            The editions were decorated with wood&#x2010;engraved vignettes by <span class="persName-">Thomas Bewick</span> (<span class="date-1753-1828">1753&#x2013;1828</span>), 
                            set at the heads of title pages of the poems, and producing an elegant page layout, which was made possible by the conformity of the relief wood engraving with the relief type. 
                            That conformity was not possible in the new mass&#x2010;produced <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/annuals_note.php");?>" target="_self">annuals</a>, 
                            which relied on the durability of steel engraving to achieve unprecedented print runs for illustrated books. To solve this problem, and achieve the elegant effects

                            which was widely remarked in reviews of the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY1830"><i>Italy</i></span>, 
                            whereby precise registration allowed the sheets to be run through the press twice, once for the engraving, and once for the type

                                as compared with the fairy world of brilliant light and haunted shadow suggested by the exquisite intaglio of <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s vignettes.

                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not independently title his prose pieces, but subordinated them to the topographical unit, 
                            typically separating prose from poem with a drawing, which serves as a hinge between the two kinds of writing and binds the parts into an associative, 
                            but still coherent unit. At the same time, while complementing the poems, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s prose pieces also contrast 
                            with his rather generalized, picturesque verse, by bringing the tone down to earth with first&#x2010;person, anecdotal and comedic commentary 
                            about specific locales. The prose is modeled on letterpress for landscape annuals, such as the travel writing by <span class="persName-LR">Leitch Ritchie</span> for the

                            serving as a header, placed above a poem&#x02BC;s title; and following the poem, a figure vignette after a drawing by <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>,

                                the mountains would be sighted, had <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span> continued with the poem. Biographically, the climb up that hill occurred on the same Sabbath evening

                                to the sublimity of the earlier&#x2010;composed, longer piece with its description of the river driving toward the <span class="geogName-">Rhine Falls</span>, 
                                rendered in emphatically pounded dactylic lines, which stand out from the normal, amiable flow of iambic octosyllabic verse.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">As a contrast with these large, amplified units of verse, prose, and picture, comprising contrasting genres, the section <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("corpuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix_corpus_aixlachapelle.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-composite-JRAIXLACHAPELLECOMP">&#x201C;Aix la Chapelle&#x201D;</span></a> 
                                in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> consists only of a prose text and a single illustration.

                            drawn in <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s manner. Taking up nearly a full page like <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s other ambitious copy after <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>, 
                                the lithograph&#x2010;like drawing of <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/the_meuse_liege_drawing_msix.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-artwork-JRTHEMEUSELIEGEMSIX"><i>Liège</i></span></a>, the large rectangular image of the cathedral is not a vignette, 
                            and was probably meant to imitate the comparatively large dimensions of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s portfolio. Beneath the drawing, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            allowed just enough space for the section heading and a few lines of text, just as place names are lettered directly onto <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s plates. 
                            Even here, however, where <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> pivots away from his grand multi&#x2010;genre and multi&#x2010;media amplifications of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s design, 
                            to exhibit a large&#x2010;scale but unitary plate in the manner of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>, he cannot resist varying the single prose essay by combining in it 
                            both comic and picturesque modes (the latter typically represented by verse in the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>). 
                            First, the narrator riffs on the <span class="date-1748-04-24">Peace of Aix la Chapelle</span> to mock the somnolent &#x201C;peace treaties&#x201D; governing the local postillions; 
                            then the speaker is rhapsodically taken by the sublimity of the cathedral&#x02BC;s interior in moonlight, described in the manner of <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>; 
                            and finally, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s narrator parodies a guidebook writer&#x02BC;s tour of antiquities inside the cathedral. As in the section

                            situation that bespeaks confluence. <span class="placeName-AIXLACHAPELLE">Aix la Chapelle</span> lay at the juncture of the <span class="placeName-NETHERLANDS">Netherlands</span>, 
                            <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span>, and the newly founded <span class="placeName-BELGIUM">Belgium</span>, and the city was historically distinctive for its imperial status.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s liveliness of response to the material world of art production and reproduction that guided early Victorian picturesque travel, his achievement

                            as one example of the youth&#x02BC;s tendency &#x201C;to revert to pen and ink in more factual studies of picturesque buildings and views&#x201D;, 
                            owing to a misguided direction of &#x201C;his earliest art activity . . . along lines strictly defined by adult standards and ideas of what 
                            was educationally desirable, so that he was not encouraged, nor did he have the time, to draw in a playful way the kinds of figure subjects in which a child 
                            imaginatively expresses and defines a conception of himself within a framework of human relationships&#x201D;. As a contrast with this alleged &#x201C;crippl&#x005B;ing&#x005D;&#x201D; of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s

                            Moreover, <span class="persName-PHW">Walton</span>&#x02BC;s division between precocious conventionalism and imitation and childlike creativity rules out how <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s spontaneity and invention was prompted 
                            by the excitement of manipulating, not merely mechanically imitating, the material culture surrounding a youth of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>.

                            he also amuses himself by manipulating that culture&#x2014;for example, reconceptualizing <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s full&#x2010;page engraving, 
                            <span class="title-artwork-JMWTEHRENBREITSTEIN1833"><i>Ehrenbreitstein</i></span>, as a vignette, or shrinking one of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s

                            While <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did leave the work unfinished, he had exhausted its potential, as the project propelled him forward

                     <div class="p">That the young <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> owed any debt at all to the poetry of <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/rogers_samuel_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-SR">Samuel Rogers</span> (1763&#x2013;1855)</a> may seem surprising 
                                in light of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s later story about giving offense to the famous man of taste, &#x201C;congratulating . . . 
                                &#x005B;<span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x005D; with enthusiasm on the beauty of the engravings by which his poems were illustrated&#x201D;, 
                                implying that the youth knew &#x201C;more of the vignettes &#x005B;in <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY1830"><i>Italy</i></span>&#x005D; 
                                than the verses&#x201D; (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE");?>" target="_self">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 34:96). 
                                The anecdote, which must have originated from when <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/pringle_thomas_note.php");?>" target="_self">Thomas Pringle &#x005B;1789&#x2013;1834&#x005D;</a> was editing <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s first contributions to

                                and was accordingly motivated to arrange his introduction to <span class="placeName-building-STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</span>, 
                                may have been colored by later assessments of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s writing 
                                (see <a href="#MENTORS">Mentors</a>). The <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> 
                                nonetheless reveals that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did respond insightfully and creatively to the poetry in <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, 
                                and not solely to the book&#x02BC;s illustrations and the materiality of its production.
                                What <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> might well have considered odd was <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s investment in the poetry as a model for writing less about <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> than about mountains.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">As <span class="persName-CSF">C. Stephen Finley</span> has noted, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> alludes to <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s poem <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</span> 
                                in the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#FINLEYNATURESCOVENANT");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-CSF">Finley</span>, <span class="title-book-FINLEYNATURESCOVENANT"><i>Nature&#x02BC;s Covenant</i></span></a>, 117). 
                                Two tropes from this poem are used prominently by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>. One, which occurs early in the work&#x02BC;s development, in the <a href="#COMPOSITETRAVELOGUE">Composite&#x2010;Genre Travelogue (MS IA, <i>g</i>.2)</a>, 
                                in the poem <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span>, characterizes the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> 
                                as &#x201C;the barriers of a World&#x201D; (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#ROGERSITALY1830");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>, <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY1830"><i>Italy</i> &#x005B;1830&#x005D;</span></a>, 30). 
                                In <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s usage, the trope refers to historical clashes between cultures, such as <span class="persName-HANNIBAL">Hannibal</span> struggling 
                                to overcome the Alpine &#x201C;barrier&#x201D; that stood between his forces and <span class="placeName-">Roman civilization</span>. For <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s traveler&#x2010;persona and his readers, 
                                such examples resonated with <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span>&#x02BC;s invasion of <span class="placeName-AUSTRIA">Austrian</span>&#x2010;controlled <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> 
                                in <span class="date-1800">1800</span> during the <span class="date-1798-1802-03">War of the Second Coalition</span>, 
                                when the French commander led his army across the <span class="geogName-STBERNARD">Great Saint Bernard Pass</span>, events that <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> mentions directly in the poems 
                                <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEGREATSTBERNARD">&#x201C;The Great St. Bernard&#x201D;</span> and <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEDESCENT">&#x201C;The Descent&#x201D;</span>. 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, in <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span>, 
                                elaborates on <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s brief reference to <span class="persName-HANNIBAL">Hannibal</span>&#x02BC;s crossing to develop a poem&#x2010;length spectacle, 
                                inspired probably not just by <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s lines but also by <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-artwork-JMWTHANNIBAL">vignette</span> for <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEDESCENT">&#x201C;The Descent&#x201D;</span> in the 
                                <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY1830">1830 edition of <i>Italy</i></span>, which depicts <span class="persName-HANNIBAL">Hannibal</span>&#x02BC;s army 
                                filing with their elephants through the mountains. In his poem, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> makes a corresponding effort at writing the sublime, 
                                adumbrating the catastrophe for <span class="placeName-ROMEANCIENT">Rome</span> in the menacing turmoil of the surrounding landscape and atmosphere. The poem is to some degree an ekphrasis, 
                                based on <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s vignette 
                                (see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/passing_the_alps_poem_msia_g2.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span></a> and associated contextual glosses).</div>
                     
                     <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> employs <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s term <i>barrier</i> (as well as related military metaphors such as <i>fortress</i> and <i>battlement</i>) to describe mountains as a cultural boundary in the poems 
                                <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/the_meuse_poem_msia_g1.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHEMEUSE">&#x201C;The Meuse&#x201D;</span></a>,

                                and he (or his <span class="persName-JJR">father</span>) also associates the term in this sense with the <span class="geogName-ENGLISHCHANNEL">English Channel</span> in the poem 
                                <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/calais_poem_msia_g1.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</span></a>. 
                                For the Ruskins in these poems, the &#x201C;barrier&#x201D; of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> additionally signifies 
                                a spiritual gulf between earth and heaven, as in a usage by the English Nonconformist clergyman 
                                <span class="persName-TRAFFLES">Thomas Raffles</span> (<span class="date-1788-1863">1788&#x2013;1863</span>), when first sighting 
                                <span class="geogName-ALPS">Mont Blanc</span> from a height in the French <span class="geogName-JURA">Jura</span>: 
                                &#x201C;But, oh! the amazing barrier that afar / Stayed my advent&#x02BC;rous sight, and fixed my eyes / As in aerial regions betwixt earth and heaven. / 
                                I saw the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>&#x2014;the everlasting hills&#x201D; 
                                (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#RAFFLESLETTERS");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-TRAFFLES">Raffles</span>, <span class="title-book-RAFFLESLETTERS"><i>Letters</i></span></a>, 155). 
                                For British travelers on the <span class="placeName-CONTINENT">Continent</span>, bearing witness to this spiritual boundary seems to have combined 
                                with staking an implied political barrier (akin to <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s historical sense) between Protestant and Roman Catholic. 
                                This usage overlaps with the implications of the second trope that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drew from <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</span>.</div>

                                and that does not necessarily depend for its authority on a personal acquaintance with the place being described. He is exploring style not only as a resource for artistic self&#x2010;expression 
                                but also as a means of differentiation in the artistic market: he notices how stylistic differences accompany the roles

                                and while his invariable model for verse remains the octosyllabic couplets of <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>&#x02BC;s narrative poems, 
                                he at least tries out strategies for ekphrastic and topographical description borrowed from <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> (whose voice for learning and anecdote he cannot match).</div>

                     <div class="p"><span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>, in sharp contrast with <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>, was the urbane &#x201C;man of taste,&#x201D; whose townhouse in <span class="placeName-STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</span> 
                                was a showplace of exquisitely curated Regency neoclassicism, and the scene of his famous breakfasts at which <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> acted the part of social arbiter 
                                of the current <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> artistic and literary scene. In his most positive light, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> might have appeared to the Ruskins as a splendid embodiment 
                                of <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s tastes and aspirations. A former associate of <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>, and a habitu&#x00E9; of at least the byways of fame, 
                                <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> had earned a sound reputation for his poem, <span class="title-poem-ROGERSPLEASURES"><i>The Pleasures of Memory</i></span> (<span class="date-1792">1792</span>), 
                                and, more recently, <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>. The latter may have paled in the popular glare of 
                                <span class="title-poem-BYRONPILGRIMAGE"><i>Childe Harold&#x02BC;s Pilgrimage</i></span>, but the poem was respectably and approachably 
                                neoclassical, regular in its versification, and grounded in the tradition of the Grand Tour to <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>. 
                                <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> was also, like <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, a successful businessman, having made his fortune in banking; 
                                and even though he lavished extravagant sums on artists, engravers, and printers in order to satisfy his perfectionism in crafting editions of his poetry, 
                                <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> recouped his huge investment in his illustrated edition of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY1830"><i>Italy</i></span> 
                                and profited handsomely by its unprecedented sales. The unattractive side of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> to the Ruskins would have been his notoriously acid wit and his worldliness at a time when middle&#x2010;class Evangelical earnestness 
                                was turning the tide on Regency profligacy.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">The two writers also differed profoundly in taste. <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> was so committed to his neoclassicism that <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> 
                                reined in his apocalyptic manner typical of his other works of the period in favor of a style that would harmonize with <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s restraint&#x2013;for

                                in the age of <span class="persName-CJHD">Dickens</span>. In a time when critical discourse commonly bemoaned the decline of poetry in unpropitious circumstances

                                Yet, while <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> fits the anecdote into what he now regarded as his fatuous beginnings as a poet, his misplaced complements to the illustrator
