                  allowing himself latitude that presumably was taken by his predecessors (e.g.,
                  <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> along with

                    ><span class="persName-TP">Thomas Pringle</span></a
                  >), and holding himself to an editorial principle that can at best be summarized
                  as aesthetic preference. Creative writing is justified, if he can discern “neither
                  rhyme nor reason” in a line, and the design of the
                  <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891">1891 <i>Poems</i></span> rules over the
                  reconstruction of the
                  <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>, which is presented
                  as a work solely in verse, despite <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs
                  intentions for a composite verse, prose, and graphic work, as reflected in his
                  fair copy. <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> labored to construct an
                  accurate manuscript chronology in the

                    >“Preliminary Note on the Original MSS of the Poems”</span

                  <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> editing and manuscript curation, but his
                  concept of an “original manuscript” entailed no responsibility to apply that
                  chronology meaningfully to the editing of a given work by reconstructing its
                  compositional history.

                  Thus, for example, in editing the
                  <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>,
                  <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> drew the main copytexts of
                  <span class="title-poem-JRANDERNACHT">“Andernacht”</span> and
                  <span class="title-poem-JRSTGOAR">“St. Goar”</span> from their publication as
                  <span class="title-poem-JRFRAGMENTS">“Fragments from a Metrical Journal”</span>,
                  subordinating their manuscript texts to endnotes containing what he calls their
                  “first sketch” or “first draft” (the terms are apparently interchangeable),
                  conceding that “it may be interesting to compare the two versions” (manuscript and
                  publication) in order to show, “if for nothing else, . . . that the young poet
                  could polish when he chose, and that he would have eliminated the slipshod grammar
                  and faulty rhymes if he had prepared the rest of his juvenile verses for
                  publication”. It seems not to have struck
                  <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> that the interest in comparing
                  published and manuscript versions lay, not in copyediting corrections (<span

                  kind), but in differences of diction, economy, and formal elements influenced by
                  the respective projects to which the versions belonged. The term
                  <i>first sketch</i> or <i>first draft</i> belies the manuscript versions of
                  <span class="title-poem-JRANDERNACHT">“Andernacht”</span> and
                  <span class="title-poem-JRSTGOAR">“St. Goar”</span> in particular, which are not
                  “slipshod” sketches or drafts but exacting fair copies—the
                  <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> versions transcribed in a
                  “copperplate” hand directly or indirectly from the

                  manuscript that itself appears to be a presentation copy (purpose unknown).
                  Regardless, for <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>, the varieties of
                  manuscript textual witness collapse into “originals” versus “polished” versions,
                  the former disarmed of textual authority and open to seemingly limitless editorial
                  intervention, and the latter given unquestioned authority though abstracted from
                  the social history of editors, publishers, and printers that bestowed the
                  authority in the first place (what

                  In place of this missing textual history,
                  <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs edition substitutes a documentary
                  history of artifacts, a “study of these ancient Codices, and of their
                  Palæography”, resulting in “a complete sequence of the phases of Mr.

                  The paleography, witnessed in the edition by photogravures of specimens of

                  <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>, the correlative of a “first sketch”
                  manuscript poem was a picturesque sketch taken on the spot; and an “original”, in
                  word or picture, meant an experience. Ultimately, the story of “development” that
                  he wishes to tell is the persistent presence of that experience (see

                    known and made more profit by selling portfolios of prints from the plates.
                    These were available in ranks of quality and price: engraverʼs proofs; on India
                    paper; before and after lettering; and on varying sizes of paper—even on the

                  of development displacing the former. The
                  <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> served its purpose by
                  repeatedly capping its goals until the project was rendered obsolete by
                  publication of poems derived from it, announcing the emergence of
                  <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs first significant public persona,

                  The hypothesis advanced here is that
                  <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> developed the work in fairly distinct
                  stages, from a verse travelogue in the eighteenth‐century topographical manner—as
                  represented by <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG1">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span>, a
                  collaboration with <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>—to a
                  composite‐genre, illustrated travelogue that reflected the material culture
                  surrounding the ekphrastic and travel‐related publishing of the
                  <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. Finally,
                  <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> found himself being brought forward as a
                  published author, credited with two works in the fashionable
                  <a href="/notes/annuals_note" target="_self">literary and artistic annual</a>,
                  <a href="/notes/friendships_offering_note" target="_self"

                    ></a
                  >. To form one of these published works,

                    ></a
                  >, he revised a pair of poems selected from
                  <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>. The title suggests a
                  reversion to the initial conception of the
                  <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> as a verse sequence.
                  To form the second work, the topographical and travel poem,

                    ><span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">“Saltzburg”</span></a
                  >, he did not adapt material directly from the
                  <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>, but he deployed
                  strategies learned from the ekphrastic and composite‐genre character of the workʼs
                  advanced stage of composition. Draft of

                  <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> venturing to define a persona behind the
                  initials <span class="persName-pen_name-JR">J.R.</span> attached to the published
                  poems.

                    The case for this manuscript as the earliest extant piece of the

                    the fact that its in‐line and interlinear insertions, deletions, substitutions,

                    I interpret this manuscript as witnessing an all‐verse version of the
                    travelogue, composed with some degree of collaboration by father and son. As
                    discussed in <a href="#DATEOFCOMPOSITION">Date of Composition</a>, the
                    manuscript is undated, and it remains an open question whether it was composed
                    during the <span class="date-1833-05-1833-09">May–September 1833</span> journey
                    itself, or following the familyʼs return home around
                    <span class="date-1833-09-20">20 September</span>.

                  <div class="p">
                    The recto of sheet 1 of the manuscript begins with the poem,
                    <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">“Calais”</span>, entitled as such, and in the
                    hand of <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>. On the verso,
                    <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> continued with the poem,
                    <span class="title-poem-JRCASSEL">[“Cassel”]</span> (untitled, and therefore
                    identifiable as a new poem following
                    <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">“Calais”</span> only on the grounds of the two
                    poemsʼ separation in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair
                    copy). At line 19 of <span class="title-poem-JRCASSEL">[“Cassel”]</span>,
                    <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs hand takes over (not
                    <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs, whose terminal letters are
                    typically formed differently than what prevails here).
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> carries the poem onto sheet 2 of the
                    manuscript (evidence, along with their physical similarity, that the two sheets
                    form a single manuscript), filling recto and verso with the continuation of
                    <span class="title-poem-JRCASSEL">[“Cassel”]</span>,
                    <span class="title-poem-JRLILLE">“Lille”</span>,

                    <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMEUSE">“The Meuse”</span>.

                  <div class="p">
                    The physical manuscript bears the appearance of a self‐standing fair copy, which
                    was later subjected to revision. No other extant manuscript belonging to the
                    <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> project consists
                    solely of verse, and the arrangement of lines on the page indicates more care
                    than in a draft. On sheet 1, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs
                    large, eighteenth‐century hand takes up the full width of the paper for each
                    line, and <span class="persName-JR">John</span> sustained his fatherʼs single
                    column, but in narrower scope and a smaller hand. On the verso of sheet 2,
                    however, <span class="persName-JR">John</span> stacked the lines in double
                    columns, as if imitating printed verse (although he inserted the final poem in
                    the sequence, <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMEUSE">“The Meuse”</span>, sideways
                    in space remaining on the recto of sheet 2, rather than starting a third sheet).
                    The few substitutions—all apparently in <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs
                    hand, although not certainly so, especially in the case of overwriting—are
                    mostly interlinear, made as strikethroughs with insertions above or below the
                    line, with only a few instances as in‐line revisions, suggesting that these
                    changes formed a distinct stage of this manuscriptʼs development, following its
                    original purpose as a fair copy. Moreover, in the margins of both sheets,
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> numbered the lines of the poems
                    sequentially and continuously (1–173); that is, he did not begin his line
                    numbering anew with each poem, suggesting that he regarded the poems as forming
                    a sequence.

                  <div class="p">
                    It is possible that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> originally
                    authored <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">“Calais”</span> and at least the
                    first 18 lines of <span class="title-poem-JRCASSEL">[“Cassel”]</span>, which are
                    in his hand, and that <span class="persName-JR">John</span> thereafter took over
                    the composition, revising some of his <span class="persName-JJR">father</span>ʼs
                    lines in the process. This scenario cannot be absolutely proven, but neither can
                    <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and
                    <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>ʼs assumption that sheet 1 of the
                    manuscript bears witness to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs
                    “copy” of <span class="persName-JR">his son</span>ʼs original verse (<a

                    <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs hand, it is notable that in‐line
                    revisions occur solely in lines written originally in his hand, whereas his
                    revisions of lines written originally in
                    <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs hand occur solely as interlinear
                    or overwriting, possibly suggesting that
                    <span class="persName-JR">John</span> had no part in a first stage of composing
                    this sheet.

                    <span class="persName-JR">son</span>ʼs collaboration. It is at least evident
                    that the material witness of this manuscript indicates some degree of poetic
                    collaboration by father and son, and it is noteworthy that this collaboration
                    took place within the frame of the Augustan verse travelogues that prevailed in
                    <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs youth, rather than the manner of

                    with these places, as they journeyed down the

                    <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">“Passing the Alps”</span> and
                    <span class="title-poem-JRMILANCATHEDRAL">“Milan Cathedral”</span>, the
                    <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy having been abandoned
                    toward the end of sections describing the
                    <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> journey, before the sequence could
                    arrive at the crossing of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>. The
                    manuscriptʼs place in the evolution of the
                    <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> appears to be a
                    transitional one between the all‐verse and the fully developed composite‐genre
                    versions, since it contains a mix of genres (albeit no graphic illustrations) as
                    well as a selection of works about destinations that seems strategically chosen.
                    The audience and occasion of the manuscript will, however, probably always
                    remain obscure.

                    The two pairs of poems presented imaginative cruxes also in the process of

                    <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy, the trio of

                    <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>, even though the
                    labor of assembling and fair‐copying these particular sections lay far ahead in
                    the process (given that, in the sequence of
                    <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft, these prose essays
                    are succeeded by other draft essays that would first have to incorporated into

                    In the current state of the manuscript, the gap most likely to have originally
                    held a vignette, which has since been removed, is the space left for a vertical

                    vignettes, lacks a caption, since he recognized that the vignette form seeks a
                    more integrated and imaginative relation with text than the distinctness of an
                    illustrative plate with its lettering of title, artist, and engraver (a stage of
                    production separate from the engraving of the image itself). Thus, we are
                    provided with a basis for distinguishing tour sketches, like those in the
                    <span class="placeName-BOSTON">Boston</span> sheet, from drawings that
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intended specifically to insert into the
                    fair‐copy <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>—even
                    though as <span class="persName-PHW">Walton</span> remarks, the tour sketches
                    themselves resemble “school copies rather than records of things seen, and . . .
                    were probably elaborated in hotel rooms or at home” (p. 14).

                    the latter holds five mountain sketches (plus a smaller undeveloped
                    architectural subject) arranged horizontally. One can imagine
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> cutting the five smaller drawings into
                    separate slips and inserting them directly as vignettes into

                    <span class="persName-PHW">Walton</span> characterizes the tour sketches as
                    “composed with schematic distinctions of tone and form from plane to plane in an

                    <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>‐influenced vignettes, as exemplifed by

                    is a notebook that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had used for rough
                    copy of imaginative writing, largely poetry, since
                    <span class="date-1831">1831</span>, and that he would continue to use for

                    possibly as late as <span class="date-1838">1838</span>. The draft relevant to
                    the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> includes verse
                    and prose intended for the composite‐genre version, which

                    mainly to the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> journey, the first

                    <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span>. The draft is notably
                    homogeneous compared to the miscellaneous contents that precede it in the

                    items related to the tour. Toward the end of the stint, the draft becomes

                    <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> neglected to analyze how this

                    development of the work, even though he was familiar with these other
                    manuscripts. Yet <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not, it is true,
                    simply pick up in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> where he
                    had left off composing verse and prose for the composite‐genre version in
                    previous extant manuscripts. By starting the draft in

                    <span class="title-essay-JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">“Source of the Arveron”</span>,
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was casting forward to a projected
                    conclusion of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>—a
                    complement to beginning

                  <div class="p">
                    The prose essay headed by the title
                    <span class="title-essay-JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">“Source of the Arveron”</span>
                    describes an episode that occurred at the end of the Ruskinsʼ tour, during their
                    stay in <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</span>.
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> probably meant the title to apply also
                    to the untitled poem following the essay,
                    <a href="/witnesses/i_woke_to_hear_the_lullaby_poem_msviii" target="_self"

                    invented title, “The Arve at Chamouni”, the poem describes the
                    <span class="geogName-ARVE">Arve River</span> flowing through the valley of
                    <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</span>. In other words,
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intended this opening title of the
                    <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> draft as a section
                    heading for prose and verse—a unit in the already fully developed composite
                    version of the work. This increased complexity in composition at the start of
                    the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft is significant,
                    not only as additional proof that
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> initiated this stint at a stage when he
                    had already conceived of the
                    <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> as a
                    composite‐genre work, but also as an indication of the design and thematic
                    coherence he imagined for the work—albeit a plan that he never completed the
                    fair copy.

                    The hike to the glacier source of the
                    <span class="geogName-ARVERON">Arveron River</span> was a popular activity for
                    tourists in <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</span>. In
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs telling, the excursion suggests a
                    quest for poetic origins: led by local children acting as guides, the walk to
                    the “source” reveals a

                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drew together multiple ideas, including
                    the trope of crossing mountains into a sacred bourne, a theme that he had

                    <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span
                    >, the approach plays out topographically coming from the west, in the poems

                    and <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEDESCENT">“The Descent”</span>, rather than
                    coming from the north as the Ruskins did.)
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poems lack the pedantic historical
                    references with which <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>
                    labors his verse; instead, the youth (who was in any case inadequately learned
                    to make such allusions) allowed the verse to unfold by tracing the landscape
                    itself, coupling the description, if with anything, with a reverential topic,
                    such as the sabbath setting of

                    fit that word on the line in the fair copy (hence, the tightly fitted, almost
                    run‐together “circumnavigating, for”); then perhaps stopped fair‐copying the
                    prose in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>, in order to compose
                    the poem about <span class="placeName-CHIAVENNA">Chiavenna</span> that falls

                    in the same unidentified hand, which worked from the opposite end of the

                    of composition in the manuscripts, despite the sometimes helter‐skelter of
                    leaping around the map in the topographical sequence of subjects in draft for

                    Overall, a chronological order of composition is indicated by the sequential
                    line numbering from manuscript to manuscript, despite unexplained gaps in the
                    numbering, which supports the textual history proposed here for the evolution of
                    the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span> project. The
                    numbering advances sequentially from 1–173 in
                    <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG1">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span>, to 360–429 in

                    <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>. In the two sheets
                    comprising <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG1">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span>, the
                    lines of the five poems are numbered continuously, 1–173, without breaks between
                    the separate poems. In
                    <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG2">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span>, the line
                    numbering begins following the prose essay,
                    <span class="title-essay-JRCALAISPROSE">“Calais”</span>, starting with the first
                    line of
                    <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">“Passing the Alps”</span> as line
                    360, and running continuously from poem to poem, to line 429. Since the poems in
                    this manuscript, unlike those in
                    <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG1">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span>, could never have
                    been conceived as sequentially ordered in a topographical sense for fair copy,
                    this instance shows that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not employ
                    the system in the course of composition to keep track of a topographical
                    ordering of sections. Nonetheless, the numbering may have been useful to him
                    when transferring draft to fair copy in

                    In the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft sequence, the

                    prose on the page, the line numbering halts, and then resumes sequentially
                    following the interruption. As in
                    <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG2">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span>, the line
                    numbering in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> bears no
                    relation to the topographical sequence, which is jumbled, with poems drafted in
                    no particular geographical order (except for the occasional topographical
                    cluster), and with some poems such as
                    <span class="title-poem-JRHEIDELBERG">“Heidelberg”</span> and
                    <span class="title-poem-JRGENOA">“Genoa”</span> divided into parts separated by
                    several pages with no effect on the numbering sequence. Thus, in
                    <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> as well,
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs numbering the lines of poetry seems
                    mechanical. Doubtless, he needed a line count in order to estimate the space
                    needed to fair‐copy lines; however, the system would not have helped him
                    estimate space for prose, and the presence of the numbering in
                    <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG1">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span> suggests that he
                    initiated the numbering scheme before he even conceived the composite‐genre
                    version represented by the fair copy.

                  <div class="p">
                    Nonetheless, the line numbering can be used to corroborate other evidence in
                    drawing conclusions about the
                    <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">“Account”</span>. For example, the
                    onset of the numbering in

                    relevance of the poem. At the opposite end of the

                    suggesting either that the poem bears a tangential relation to the

                    numbering system served an additional purpose to counting lines for the

                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> sometimes numbered the ruled lines on
                    the page ahead of composing and was merely careless about using those
                    pre‐numbered lines for other kinds of poetry.

                    Irregularities occur within the numbering, some of which are probably mere
                    mistakes. It is possible, however, that some irregularities can be used as
                    evidence in unraveling a more complex compositional history than what usually
                    appears to have been a straightforwardly linear production of text. These cases
                    are discussed in the textual glosses appended to individual texts.

                        poems can be viewed as germs of fully developed sections. The fact that most

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> mean to enumerate as <i>wanting</i>?
                        If the number pertains to his list of proposed figures for each section
                        (column 2.<i>c</i>), then perhaps it signifies how many more sources or
                        ideas for illustrations he believed he required, if any, in order to enhance
                        each section adequately. (The minimum would have been two—a header and a
                        footer for each section—and the maximum typically four: using the
                        fair‐copied
                        <a
                          href="/corpuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix_corpus_calais"

                        >
                        as a standard for a section, the poem and the essay could each have its own
                        header and footer, for a total of four, although the limit was truly bounded
                        only by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs imagination and ambition.)
                        Alternatively, the number of items <i>wanting</i> might refer to how many of
                        the ideas in column 2.<i>c</i> remained to be actually carried out with
                        drawings.<br /><br />
                        Unfortunately, since some drawings he did complete may no longer be extant,
                        any conclusion based on the numbers in column 2.<i>a</i> is checked by
                        uncertainty owing not only to the current state of
                        <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>, but also to the point at
                        which he happened to note the number, since he could have produced a drawing
                        subsequently (see also
                        <a href="#CURATORIALTREATMENT"

                          Manuscripts</a
                        >). An example of these ambiguities is the zero in column 2.<i>a</i> next to
                        <span class="title-composite-JRHEIDELBERGCOMP">“Heidelberg”</span> (<a

                        than the five listed. Indeed, five would surely have sufficed, but what are
                        we to make of the drawing already in place in

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs work plan, which would have
                        resumed with

                        (see column 1.<i>c</i>), a difference between the two lists can indicate a

                        but presumably they stand in some relation to those in column 2.<i>a</i>.
                        One possibility may be that, if the numbers in column 2.<i>a</i> give a
                        total of proposed illustrations “wanted”, these in column 2.<i>d</i>
                        indicate the number of illustrations completed.

                  <div class="p">
                    There seems no sure way to tell whether
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> compiled the two lists all at once in a
                    short time or developed them over a lengthy duration. The physical arrangement
                    of the columns on the endpapers indicates that list 1 must have existed prior to
                    list 2, as borne out by the evidence already noted of the later,
                    <span class="date-1834-06">June 1834</span> terminus a quo for the start of list
                    2. (Both lists appear to have wrapped around the pen‐and‐ink drawing of
                    mountains on the verso, whereas the position of the box on the recto, containing
                    a note concerning a “Birthday poem”, might have been added at any time.) One
                    clue about the development of list 1 may lie in the checkmarks to the left of
                    some place‐names, which appear to designate that those places were already
                    represented by individual poems in the
                    <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> and
                    <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span> draft. Notably, two
                    items in the list that are <i>not</i> checked are

                      ><span class="title-poem-">“Villa Pliniana”</span></a
                    >—the final two poetry drafts that
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composed in
                    <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> before he interrupted work

                    destinations in list 1 prior to drafting their respective poems, he must have
                    compiled the list in a fairly brief period between when he completed and
                    fair‐copied the sections at the start of the list (<span

                    by this time been superseded, since the earliest extant texts of the poems

                    close together is suggested, moreover, by the probable timing of

                    [<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>] thrust them aside for prose”, the
                    youth “could better put the complicated feelings, thoughts, and facts which he

                    should we not go and see some of them in reality? My father hesitated a little,

                    lettered directly onto the lithographic stone, as part of the image. The
                    lithographs, then a new medium in
                    <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>, would have struck the Ruskins by
                    their dramatically large size (22 by 15 inches) and watercolor‐like texture.
                    <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>ʼs significance for British perceptions of
                    northern Europe lay in the novelty of his representations of towns in northern

                    <span class="date-1820-1839">1820s–30s</span>, emergent developments in
                    touristic experience were perhaps most vivid in new and less familiar routes
                    opening up in northern Europe alongside the well‐worn paths of the Grand Tour to
                    <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>. Whereas travel in the

                    his work <i>A Poem</i>, and he dispersed the few prose pieces irregularly, with
                    at most a pattern of loose association with their immediately surrounding poems,
                    whereas <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> constructed each of his
                    topographical sections (with one exception) using both verse and prose. Unlike
                    <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>,
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not independently title his prose
                    pieces, but subordinated them to the topographical unit, typically separating
                    prose from poem with a drawing, which serves as a hinge between the two kinds of
                    writing and binds the parts into an associative, but still coherent unit. At the
                    same time, while complementing the poems,
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs prose pieces also contrast with his
                    rather generalized, picturesque verse, by bringing the tone down to earth with
                    first‐person, anecdotal and comedic commentary about specific locales. The prose

                    probably meant to imitate the comparatively large dimensions of
                    <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>ʼs portfolio. Beneath the drawing,
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> allowed just enough space for the

                    somnolent “peace treaties” governing the local postillions; then the speaker is
                    rhapsodically taken by the sublimity of the cathedralʼs interior in moonlight,
                    described in the manner of <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>; and finally,
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs narrator parodies a guidebook writerʼs

                    In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs liveliness of response to the

                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs adoption of
                    <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>ʼs “outline style” of depicting old
                    architecture with “broken lines and dots” as one example of the youthʼs tendency
                    “to revert to pen and ink in more factual studies of picturesque buildings and
                    views”, owing to a misguided direction of “his earliest art activity . . . along
                    lines strictly defined by adult standards and ideas of what was educationally
                    desirable, so that he was not encouraged, nor did he have the time, to draw in a
                    playful way the kinds of figure subjects in which a child imaginatively
                    expresses and defines a conception of himself within a framework of human
                    relationships”. As a contrast with this alleged “crippl[ing]” of
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs imagination, which “had much to do

                    apprised of his other firsts for this year, the poetry commissions for

                      ><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span

                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would find it convenient to stress his
                    keenness of factual observation at the expense of his poetic effusion. Again,
                    however, from the perspective of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>,
                    one can perceive commonalities in these mentorships.

                    <span class="persName-JCL">Loudon</span>ʼs publications also depended on the
                    thriving visual culture of illustrated books and magazines during the period,
                    and they were perhaps not too distant from the poetry anthologies in their
                    communal appraoch, inviting amateurs to contribute to forums such as the
