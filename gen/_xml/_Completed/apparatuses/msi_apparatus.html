                    not clear in this case whether, for this purpose, an existing notebook leaf was used (e.g.,
                    whether <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs “frontispiece” originally began on 2r,
                    following this leaf), or whether a piece of paper was trimmed to the 
                    <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self">Red Book</a>ʼs size and inserted
                    here. The latter is more probable, since similar insertions in other Red Books 
                    (e.g., <a href="/apparatuses/msiii_apparatus" target="_self">MS III</a>) certainly formed no part of the original notebook.</div>
                        
                        <div class="p">Despite <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs erratic page numbering, no leaves appear to be missing,
                    except for pp. 30–31, which cause a gap in the text. This missing leaf
                    probably included a “plate,” <a href="/figures/D5" target="_self">[Plate 4, “Harry and Lucy,” Vol. 1]</a>.
                    The leaf containing plate 5, <a href="/figures/D6" target="_self">“Lucyʼs Drawing Room,” [Plate] “5,” [“Harry and Lucy,” Vol. 1”]</a> (pp.
                    36–37) was likewise torn out, although this leaf was reattached, using a
                    glued, perforated sticker (since the tear line fits the remaining stub, this
                    leaf was evidently not moved here from elsewhere). The gummed strip used to mend
                    this leaf—resembling the border from a sheet of postage stamps—resembles
                    one put to a similar use in proof sheets for <a href="/notes/poems_1891_note" target="_self"><i>Poems</i> (1891)</a> (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFMS70" target="_self">RF MS 70</a>). On this evidence,
                    one infers that <a href="/notes/collingwood_w_g_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span></a> had a hand preserving MS I, an inference
                    coincident with his preparing the first bibliography of these manuscripts, the
                    “Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS4D1891" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS4D1891"><i>Poems</i> [4<sup>o</sup>, 1891]</span></a>, 1:261–67;

                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs erratic page numbering through p. 50 probably arose from
                    his attempt to correct earlier misnumbering. Erased earlier numbering remains
                    visible starting on the present p. 21 (“19” is the erased
                    number, an error since p. 19 had already appeared) and continuing consecutively
                    through p. 49[<i>b</i>] (i.e., the <i>second</i>
                    p. 49). Since the latter was written over top of “47,” it
                    appears that, at about this point, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> realized an error, went back to the
                    present p. 21, and began renumbering; however, he made some new errors and
                    possibly deliberately repeated pp. 48–49 in an attempt to bring his
                    numbering in sync with following pages. The erratic numbering after p. 50
                    appears to have resulted from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> writing “80” for
                    “60,” and carrying on without correction. The missing p. 87 is
                    probably a mere oversight.</div>

                    and in the “plates,” he imitated any
                    number of books in the Ruskin family library (<span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>ʼs volumes were
                    not illustrated). Most of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs “plates” bear no
                    apparent relation with the text, but the frontispiece,
                    <a href="/figures/D4" target="_self">“Frontispiece” [Plate] “1” [“Harry and Lucy” Vol 1]</a>, 
                    which features “a rainbow,” may be
                    complemented by the last of the poems in the anthology, <a href="/apparatuses/on_the_rainbow_apparatus" target="_self">“On the Rainbow: In Blank Verse.”</a> The
                    rainbow drawing, moreover, could refer to Harryʼs vision of the Witch of
                    the Alps at the end of <a href="/apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus" target="_self">“Harry and Lucy,” Vol. 1</a>. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> could have added the rainbow to the
                    frontispiece as an afterthought: we cannot know for certain whether the textual
                    rainbow suggested the graphic one, or vice versa, or whether the two are
                    definitely related at all. But it seems likely that he arranged the contents in
                    order to frame the book with the theme of the rainbow as both promise and
                    closure.</div>
                        
                        <div class="p">Another sign of control over the entirety of the contents appears at the end of
                    the Red Book, on p. 106, where <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> placed a colophon:
                    “The end / <span class="placeName-HERNE">hernhill</span> / <span class="placeName-FOUNTAINST">fountain street</span> / <span class="del">end of the poems</span> / juvenile library <span class="placeName-FOUNTAINST">fountain street</span>.” The
                    colophon is followed by <a href="/figures/D1" target="_self">“Heights of Wisdom, Depth of Fools” [Miscellaneous Drawing, MS I]</a>, in
                    which the concave shape of the narrow valley appears to answer to the convex
                    form of the rainbow in the frontispiece. The colophon could be based on 
                    <a href="/notes/bibliography#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED" target="_self"><span class="persName-ME">Maria Edgeworth</span>, <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span>s</a>, which concludes in the fourth volume with
                    “<span class="smallcaps">The End.</span>” and, below that,
                    “<span class="smallcaps"><span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>:</span> / <span class="smallcaps">Printed by <span class="persName-CW">Charles Wood</span>,</span> / <span class="placeName-POPPINSCT">Poppinʼs Court</span>, <span class="placeName-FLEETST">Fleet Street</span>.”</div>
                        
                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> evidently meant the colophon to unify the entire contents of MS I—<a href="/apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus" target="_self">“Harry and Lucy,” Vol. 1</a>, 
                        along with the <a href="/apparatuses/msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus" target="_self">MS I Poetry Anthology</a>—but the
                    deletion within the colophon of “end of the poems” points to how his
                    attempts at symmetry and closure were ongoing decisions. It appears that the deleted phrase originally formed part of a colophon that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> meant to apply only to the poetry anthology, 
                    but that, by deleting the phrase, he caused to refer to the entire Red Book, not just the
                    poems (reading, in effect, “The end / <span class="placeName-HERNE">hernhill</span> / <span class="placeName-FOUNTAINST">fountain street</span> / juvenile library <span class="placeName-FOUNTAINST">fountain street</span>”). Another, slightly different scenario is possible: the fact that the final two
                    poems of the anthology fall after <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs annotation dating the whole of
                    MS I may indicate that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> added these poems (on pp.
                    103–6) after his <span class="persName-MR">mother</span>ʼs dating, and as he did so, he deleted “end of
                    the poems” on p. 106 so as not to belie his addition. But this possibility seems contradicted by the placement of the colophon following all of the poems. 
                    It is also possible, of course, whatever the scenario, that the deletion was not made by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, but by someone
                    else.</div>

                    Could <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> be referring to what <i>Praeterita</i> records as an early memory, the water

                    In <i>Praeterita,</i> <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> leaves unclear whether he observed

                    (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#RUSKINSCAMBERWELL" target="_self">Dearden, <i>Ruskinʼs Camberwell</i></a>, 1). By the time <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> first wrote about this
                    memory in <span class="date-1871">1871</span> (in <i>Fors Clavigera</i>

                    27:169]), he might well have confused memories of the two locations; or the
                    colophon itself might have suggested such a memory to him, when he doubtless
                    reviewed his juvenilia for those later autobiographical writings. Unfortunately,
                    attempts have been unsuccessful to gain information about either a <span class="placeName-FOUNTAINST">Fountain Street</span>
