                    disagreed with <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs interpretation, ascribing the status of the earliest dated verse possibly to 
                    <a href="/apparatuses/the_steam_engine_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHESTEAMENGINE">“When furious up from mines the water pours” [“The Steam Engine”]</span></a>, 
                    which is “poem I” in the <a href="/apparatuses/msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus" target="_self">MS I Poetry Anthology</a>:
                    “there is nothing to show,” they wrote, “that [<span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs date] does not apply equally to all four pieces, composed
                    presumably in the order in which they are placed in the book.” (They also pointed to another possible contendor,
                    besides <a href="/apparatuses/the_steam_engine_apparatus" target="_self">“When furious up from mines the water pours” [“The Steam Engine”]</a>, 
                    for the distinction of earliest poem—<a href="/apparatuses/ragland_castle_apparatus" target="_self">“Ragland Castle,”</a> which is the first poem in another

                    [<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 2:255 n. 1;

                     <div class="p">Putting aside <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>ʼs faulty assumptions about the composition of the poems in the anthology
                    (i.e., that <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs note necessarily refers to all
                    four poems preceding the note, not just to “The Needless Alarm”; and that the first poem of this group
                    to be fair‐copied, <a href="/apparatuses/the_steam_engine_apparatus" target="_self">“When furious up from mines the water pours” [“The Steam Engine”]</a> 
                    or “poem I,” must necessarily have been the first composed), their interpretation of what <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs date,
                    “<span class="date-1826-01">Jan<sup>y</sup> 1826</span>,” does signify seems hardly credible: the date, according to the editors, “seems to be the date of the note, and not of any one of the verses in
                    particular.” That is, in their view, “<span class="date-1826-01">Jan<sup>y</sup> 1826</span>” applies to
                    the note that follows, “this book begun about <span class="date-1826-09-1826-10">Sep<sup>t</sup> or Oct 1826</span> / finished about <span class="date-1827-01">Jan<sup>y</sup> 1827</span>.”
                    The obvious discrepancy between the alleged date <i>of</i> the note and the date <i>in</i> the note is explained, further, 
                    as the writerʼs mistake: “perhaps, writing at the beginning of a new year, <span class="persName-MR">Mrs. Ruskin</span> made the common error of not altering the
                    old yearʼs date”—writing, that is, “<span class="date-1826-01">Jan<sup>y</sup> 1826</span>,” but intending
                    “<span class="date-1827-01">Jan<sup>y</sup> 1827</span>” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 2:255 n. 1).</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Since Cook and Wedderburnʼs reasoning depends on overruling what <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> actually wrote, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs interpretation seems certainly more
                    straightforward and surely at least as convincing—namely, that her first date applies to “The Needless Alarm,” but not necessarily to all four
                    of the poems preceding the note. While “The Needless Alarm” must have been fair‐copied “about <span class="date-1827-01">Jan<sup>y</sup>
                        1827</span>” along with the other verse at the end of <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self">MS I</a>, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> would have known if <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had composed
                    the poem a year earlier than the others. There is, moreover, another instance of <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs glossing a poem with a date earlier than surrounding 
                    poems—<a href="/apparatuses/glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus#DATE" target="_self">“Glen of Glenfarg” (“Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill”)</a>, 
                    in <a href="/apparatuses/msiii_apparatus" target="_self">MS III</a>—and, in that case, <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> do accept <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs authority at face value. Finally, it seems
                    implausible that <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> would have written <span class="date-1826">1826</span> for <span class="date-1827">1827</span> without noticing the error, since her note about the date of
                    the whole of <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self">MS I</a> (which is unquestioned) is placed immediately below.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Without following <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> in their argument for dating “The Needless Alarm” some time after 
                    <a href="/apparatuses/the_steam_engine_apparatus" target="_self">“When furious up from mines the water pours” [“The Steam Engine”]</a>, 
                    one might, however, accept their suggestion that <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> intends “<span class="date-1826-01">Jan<sup>y</sup> 1826</span>” to refer to all four poems
                    preceding her note. This possibility is entertained in dating these poems.</div>
