                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composed the poem in blank verse, except for the final ten lines, which he headed “conclusion” in draft, 
                            and which he formed as rhymed octosyllabic couplets, perhaps influenced by <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>. 
                            Structurally, the rough draft works by simple accretion, one section or strophe being added to the next using explicit transitions, such as 
                            “Ive treated of the clouds. now <span class="geogName-SKIDDAW">skiddaw</span> come” and “Now <span class="geogName-DERWENTWATER">derwent water</span> come”. 
                            Writing the poem in stages, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> changed from pencil to pen, and from one color of ink to another. 
                            Twice he interrupted composition of the poem with other texts. Given this structure of built‐up units over time, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> treated the draft as both expandable and contractible—the 
                            contraction evident in a deleted ninth line, which could have triggered a premature ending, “Now hear my boyish moral”. 
                            Yet the poemʼs title suggests that, from the start, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> projected his compound topic of mountain and lake; 
                            no evidence suggests that he decided seriatim to write first about <span class="geogName-SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</span> and then to add a strophe 
                            about <span class="geogName-DERWENTWATER">Derwent Water</span>. The title containing the two place names shows no cramping on the page, 
                            as if he added the phrase “& lake derwent” as an afterthought. Overall, the poem represents a sustained and sophisticated effort, 
                            an advance in realized poetic ambition beyond anything <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had both attempted and completed previously; and although its composition worked 
                            by accretion, compiling conventional picturesque tropes, the poem convinces as a whole.</div>

                            that “<span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> and I thought that we remembered a great deal but when we came to write it down we found that we did not remember so much as we thought”

                            This intrusion, as it were, of <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> into <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <a href="/apparatuses/msii_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span></a>,

                            With this increased intimacy, <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> may have inluenced the initial draft of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs topographical poem,

                                The <span class="geogName-SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</span> strophe closes with a line urging “no more on this sad subject on this happy day”, 
                            referring to the topic of a shepherdʼs death—a “white tomb” on the mountainside awaiting a swain “who wanders far from home”. 
                            This detail opens a window onto a scene at <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span>, in which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, still in the midst of drafting 
                            “that blank verse upon <span class="geogName-DERWENTWATER">Lake Derwent</span>”, was asked by <span class="persName-JJR">his father</span> to see the poem,

                            and I did not wish you to see it beforehand”. Sharing the poem at that stage was especially awkward, 
                            since the draft contained “a line saying something about this happy day”—the closing line of the first strophe, referring to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>'s birthday—“and 
                            I was afraid you would ask me what happy day and then the whole secret would gradually have been hauled out of my unwilling mouth”

                            As described here by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, this stage of the poemʼs development accords well with the first strophe

                            but as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs personal tutor with an interest in the youthʼs writing. 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs recitation of the unfinished poem to his father, with its evasive maneuveur, 
                            must have occurred sometime in the <span class="date-1829-04">last week of March or in April 1829</span>, 
                            when a gap in the surviving family letters indicates that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> had returned home from traveling for wine orders. 
                            <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> was engaged as a tutor starting early in <span class="date-1829-04">April</span>

                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have been encouraged to recite his poem to his tutor, as well. <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>ʼs 
                            influence—whether conveyed directly by the tutor as suggestions, or indirectly through his Latin instruction—is evident in the poemʼs second strophe, 
                            which introduces allusions to <span class="persName-HOMER">Homer</span>ʼs <span class="title-poem-ODYSSEY"><i>Odyssey</i></span>.</div>

                                as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> remarked in a <a href="/witnesses/jr_to_monrorobertmrs_1829_msii" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter to <span class="persName-MONROROBERTMRS">Mrs. Monro</span></span></a>, 
                            which he drafted in <span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span>. <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> amused <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                                by “comparing <span class="persName-fictional-NEPTUNE">Neptune</span>s lifting up the wrecked ships of <span class="persName-fictional-AENEAS">eenaes</span> 
                                with his trident to my lifting up a potatoe with a fork or taking a piece of bread out of a bowl of milk”. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs own classical analogies in his poem 
                                are not so whimsical, but they attribute playfulness to the landscape itself by comparing <span class="geogName-DERWENTWATER">Lake Derwent</span>ʼs “polished surface” 
                                to the “fair and oft deceiving” <span class="persName-fictional-PENELOPE">Penelope</span>, since reflections are woven on the lakeʼs surface, but unwoven 
                                when the placid surface is ruffled by “bluff” <span class="persName-fictional-AEOLUS">Aeolus</span>. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> compares this deceptive 
                                “polished surface” to “a boy at play / who labours at the snow to make a man / And when heʼs made it”, 
                                <span class="persName-fictional-PENELOPE">Penelope</span>‐like he “knocks it down again”. 
                                Comparison making is in itself a form of play, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> recognizes: 
                                “So when thouʼst made a picture thou dost play / At tearing it to pieces”.</div>

                            Without question, what the poem became through revision and publication was influenced by the character of <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>ʼs magazine, the <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span>,

                                He changes the register of the poem, however, from the playfulness of the picturesque to the solemnity of the sublime; 
                                he moves the first‐person pronoun from an agency of invention (“enough / Ive treated of the clouds. now <span class="geogName-SKIDDAW">skiddaw</span> come”) 
                                to a figure in the landscape (“there would I like to wander”); and he abandons blank verse for rhymed octosyllabic couplets—<span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>ʼs and <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>ʼs 
                                verse form for their narrative poems. These dramatic changes, combined with the emphatic labeling of the closing lines as a “conclusion”, 
                                suggest that composition of this poem was caught up along with some other works in a family debate over <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs tendency to leave his writing unfinished.</div>

                                It is possible that this pamphlet constituted the “Birthday Odes” that accompanied

                                The pamphlet matches <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs description given in the letter about its enclosure 
                                if one omits <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>ʼs bracketed editorial insertion: “On Newyearsday I prepared a small poem for you”, 
                                and therefore “on your birthday it becomes me to have a much larger [one] for you”

                                That is, by a “larger”, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have meant, not just a single larger poem,

                                but a larger project—the handmade booklet, which he dated <span class="date-1829">1829</span> on its cover, and which contains, 
                                along with the topographical poem, several other poems and a play, including the <span class="date-1829">1829</span> birthday ode,

                                consisting of the word <a href="/witnesses/play_msii" target="_self">“Play”</a> followed by a few lines.

                                pamphlet even sported a pink or red cover. As a birthday gift to his father, the pamphlet would have posed an ambitiously positive response

                                may have influenced <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs collection of a drama with other poems. <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>ʼs own children produced a handmade magazine for their household (see

                            and split into two poems for publication in the <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times: A Monthly Magazine</i></span>. 
                            Thus, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs first poem to appear in print, and his first publication of any kind, was 
                            <a href="/notes/bibliography#JRLINESCUMBERLAND1829" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRLINESCUMBERLAND1829">“Lines Written at the Lakes in <span class="placeName-CUMBERLAND">Cumberland</span>. | <i><span class="geogName-DERWENTWATER">Derwentwater</span></i>”</span></a>, 
                            which was signed “<span class="persName-pen_name-JR">R—</span>”, and which appeared in the <span class="date-1829-08-01">1 August 1829</span> (vol. 1, no. 4) issue. 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs second publication was 
                            <a href="/notes/bibliography#JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER1830" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER1830">“On <span class="geogName-SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</span> and <span class="geogName-DERWENTWATER">Derwent‐Water</span>”</span></a>, 
                            which similarly was signed “<span class="persName-pen_name-JR">R.</span>”, and which appeared in the <span class="date-1830-02">February 1830</span> (vol. 1, no. 10) issue. 
                            The responsibility and authority for the splitting and revision of the poem are unknown. As the editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> speculate, 
                            the revision presumably was guided either by the magazineʼs editor, 
                            the <a href="/notes/andrews_edward_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-EA">Reverend Edward Andrews (<span class="date-1787-1841">1787–1841</span>)</span></a>, 
                            or by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs father, <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, or by both of them. 
                            Scholars have weighted the responsibility on the fatherʼs side 
                            (see, e.g., <a href="/notes/bibliography#MAIDMENTONLYPRINT" target="_self"><span class="persName-BEM">Maidment</span>, <span class="title-essay-MAIDMENTONLYPRINT">“‘Only Print’”</span></a>, 196), 
                            but <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs influence has probably been taken too much for granted. As shown in <a href="#COMPOSITIONANDANDREWS">Composition: The Influence of <span class="persName-EA">Edward Andrews</span></a>, 
                            <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>ʼs mythology lessons are perceptible even in the draft.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">The available evidence of another hand besides <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs in the compositional process is slight. At lines 23–24

                            the <span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span> draft shows a substitution of “For less” in place of “lower”, which was written in a different medium than the underlying text, 
                            and which appears to be in the hand of <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>. The substitution was not used in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> fair copy, 
                            so one may infer that the change represents a stage of revision following <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs presentation of the poem for his fatherʼs birthday. 
                            The published version does show an alteration from the fair‐copy text at this point, but not quite the same substitution 
                            (“Though less than <span class="geogName-ANDES">Andes</span>, or the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alpine</span> heights”).</div>

                            the “conclusion” (beginning “sweet <span class="geogName-DERWENTWATER">derwent</span> on thy winding shore”) of the original draft. 
                            (In the fair copy, <a href="/witnesses/on_skiddaw_and_derwent_water_msv" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATERMSV">“On <span class="geogName-SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</span> and <span class="geogName-DERWENTWATER">Derwent Water</span>”</span></a>,

                            this concluding section is not subtitled “conclusion”, but it is marked by a horizontal bar above its first line, as in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span> draft.) 
                            Isolating these concluding lines for publication was easy, since they were already set apart from the main body of poem by their octosyllabic couplets and their sublime, rather than picturesque mode 
                            (see <a href="#COMPOSITIONANDCONCLUSION">Composition of the “Conclusion” and Parental Demands for Completion</a>). 
                            Revision of just ten lines was possible between the <span class="date-1829-05">May presentation</span> to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> and the <span class="date-1829-08">August</span> publication date, 
                            whereas revision of the main body of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs original poem apparently required the later publication date of <span class="date-1830-02">February 1830</span>.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">There was time enough, nonetheless, for the ten‐line conclusion to undergo several minor revisions and one major development to arrive at

                            The major change transfers the reflection of lightning over <span class="geogName-HELVELLYN">Mount Helvellyn</span> from the outer surface of a “mountain rill” 
                            to an internalized play “oeʼr the Poetʼs eye” and warming of his “heart”. In a brief space, 
                            the aesthetic paradigm shifts from mirror to lamp, imitation to expression. Yet the Romantic paradigm is instantly quelled by the addition 
                            of a moralizing couplet, raising the total number of lines from ten to twelve, which deprives the Poet of solace in nature: 
                            “Though such thy glories Earth, thy proudest whole, / Can never satiate the grasping soul!” Similarly, when the remainder of the poem was revised for publication

                            the manuscript originalʼs reference to the “happy day” of <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs birthday was not just omitted as being irrelevant to the poemʼs new context; 
                            the “happy day” was obliterated by seven lines of apocalyptic imagery, culminating in the “great day of fire the general grave”. (This imagery includes a reference to the “fall” of <span class="placeName-HERCULANEUM">Herculaneum</span>,

                            It is unclear how <span class="persName-HRN">Nicoll</span> arrived at this conclusion, since he had no access to the manuscript versions, draft or fair copy, lacking the couplet. Perhaps, 
                            since he gained access to a rare set of the journal issues with the assistance of the Andrews family, they made him privy to family stories

                            More likely, <span class="persName-HRN">Nicoll</span> compared the <span class="title-poem-JRLINESCUMBERLAND1829">“Lines”</span> as published in the <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span>

                            Noticing the shift in tone, <span class="persName-HRN">Nicoll</span> may have decided that the additional couplet can only have been the work of a clergyman rather than of a ten‐year‐old

                            of playfulness. In lines 12–16 of the revision, the originalʼs description of “straggler” roots is caught up in a simile about the rambunctious play of an “urchin boy”, 
                            whose foot tramples and “dissolves” the root‐bound “mould”, just as the dissolving shapes in the clouds chase away one anoother. The added simile parallels <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs own original simile 
                            of a “boy at play / who labours at the snow to make a man / And when heʼs made it knocks it down again”. As <span class="persName-HRN">Nicoll</span> concluded from his study of the magazine, 
                            <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> did not intend <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span> to be conventionally religious, and yet it is in fact 
                            conventional in its piety, if unexpectedly varied in content (see <a href="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</a>). Just so, <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> 
                            seems to have been capable equally of pairing <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs snowman maker with a playmate in the urchin boy 
                            and of dampening that playfulness with a cautionary couplet.</div>

                            he began with the entry, “on <span class="geogName-SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</span> & <span class="geogName-DERWENTWATER">Derwent Water</span> | page 72 <i>Spiritual Times</i> | <span class="date-1830-02">Feby 1830</span> age 11 years”. 
                            No mention is made, however, of <span class="title-poem-JRLINESCUMBERLAND1829">“Lines Written at the Lakes in <span class="placeName-CUMBERLAND">Cumberland</span>”</span>. 
                            While it seems surprising that the admiring father could have forgotten <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs very first appearance in print, 
                            bibliophilesʼ fascination with what were called “firsts” or “early editions” by modern authors 
                            became a phenomenon only at the <span class="date-1875-1900">end of the nineteenth century</span>. <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> was interested in preserving only the “best” 
                            of his sonʼs early publications in the collected volume—and for him, the “best” seems by definition to have precluded early, much less first, publications. 
                            He also rejected reprinting of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs first high‐profile verse publication, the poem <a href="/apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">“Saltzburg”</span></a>

                            While the family surely owned copies at one time, the issues may have gone missing by <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs time,

                            (though erroneously dated) an earlier printing history. The editors announced (albeit still incorrectly) what <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> had ignored, that “these verses are the earliest printed work of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>”

                                        and was published by Mr. D. Freeman, of 52, Paternoster Row, <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, and 8, Keeneʼs Row, <span class="placeName-WALWORTH">Walworth</span>. The editor was the <span class="persName-EA">Rev. Dr. Andrews</span>, 
                                        minister of <span class="placeName-building-BERESFORDCHAPEL">Beresford Chapel</span>, <span class="placeName-WALWORTH">Walworth</span>, one of the most distinguished dissenting ministers of his time. In the first number <span class="placeName-EA">Dr. Andrews</span> suggests 
                                        that the composition of his magazine is to be “sprightly and elegant”, that it is to “break out of the trammels in which other religious periodicals 
                                        seem proud to confine themselves, and show that even piety may be connected with high talent, and that vulgarity of style is not inseperable with what are foolishly called 
                                        high doctrines, and dullness from what more sober persons call Evangelical”. The magazine is, however, for the most part, explicitly and fervently religious. 
                                        <span class="persName-EA">Dr. Andrews</span> contributes some articles on his personal experiences as a minister, including a curious account of his visits to <span class="persName-EHHM">Edward H. H. Martelly</span>, 
                                        “under sentence of death at <span class="placeName-building-NEWGATE">Newgate</span>”. The distinction of the periodical is that it contains the first published writings of <span class="persName-JR">Mr. Ruskin</span>.

                            A second possible reason that <span class="persName-HRN">Nicoll</span>ʼs correction to the bibliography perhaps never gained traction was owing to the rarity of the

                        That he was consciously writing the present poem in the same mode is implicit in his original title,

                        patch of mountain gloom in the poem itself, such as the fatality that threatens the shepherd—the origin of <span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER">“On <span class="geogName-SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</span> and <span class="geogName-DERWENTWATER">Derwent Water</span>”</span> 
                        lay more in laughter than in tears, and that tenor was not necessarily altered by the poemʼs publication in a religious journal. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs amusement by <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>ʼs teaching style 
                        has already been remarked as an inluence on the poemʼs composition (<a href="#COMPOSITIONANDANDREWS">The Influence of <span class="persName-EA">Edward Andrews</span> on Initial Composition</a>); 
                        just so, the pleasantries of a secular, picturesque poem were not out of place in <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>ʼs new periodical, 
                        which the editor‐clergyman promised would “break out of the trammels in which other religious periodicals seem proud to confine themselves, 
                        and show that even piety may be connected with high talent, and that vulgarity of style is not inseperable with what are foolishly called high doctrines” 
                        (see <a href="#REDISCOVERY">The Rediscovery of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs First Publication</a>). This advertisement 
                        was only one among several marks of the Andrews familyʼs cultivated tastes and social ambition, such as the fine organ installed in 
                        <span class="placeName-building-BERESFORDCHAPEL">Beresford Chapel</span>, a building that <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> also owned (see

                        the Andrews children participated in these middle‐class ambitions, including making their own books by editing a family magazine, <span class="title-manuscript-BERESFORDSPY">“The Beresford Spy”</span>

                        <div class="p">The mission of <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>ʼs magazine to “break out of the trammels” of sectarianism was not unique. The much longer‐lived Congregational magazine, 
                            the <span class="title-periodical-ECLECTICREVIEW"><i>Eclectic Review</i></span> (<span class="date-1805-1868">1805–68</span>), likewise sought to undermine stiff‐necked Nonconformity 
                            and the supposed incompatibility of evangelical seriousness with a broad cultivation of literature and taste. In the <span class="title-periodical-ECLECTICREVIEW"><i>Eclectic</i></span>ʼs 
                            first years, regular contributors included the essayist, <span class="persName-JFOSTER">John Foster</span> (<span class="date-1770-1843">1770–1843</span>), and the poet, 
                            <span class="persName-JMPOET">James Montgomery</span> (<span class="date-1771-1854">1771–1854</span>). Theologically and politically, the <span class="title-periodical-ECLECTICREVIEW"><i>Eclectic</i></span> 
                            was committed to bridging the gap between Dissent and Establishment 
                            (<a href="/notes/bibliography#HILLERECLECTICREVIEW" target="_self"><span class="persName-MRHILLER">Hiller</span>, “<span class="title-periodical-HILLERECLECTICREVIEW"><i>Eclectic Review</i></span>”</a>, 179–86). 
                            On a broader scale, <span class="persName-DSCRITIC">David Stewart</span> has proposed that Romantic‐era magazines in general resisted becoming trapped in bunkered positions as culture fissured into 
                            competing disciplines and positions; instead, magazines sought a heterogeneous audience who in turn positioned itself in relation to a magazine culture and not just a single organ of opinion 
                            (<a href="/notes/bibliography#STEWARTROMANTICMAGAZINES" target="_self"><span class="persName-DSCRITIC">Stewart</span>, <span class="title-book-STEWARTROMANTICMAGAZINES"><i>Romantic Magazines and Metropolitan Literary Culture</i></span></a>, 7–8). 
                            The editors of the <span class="title-periodical-ECLECTICREVIEW"><i>Eclectic Review</i></span> discovered, however, that an “eclectic” stance was difficult to maintain, 
                            and found themselves driven to promoting more decisively Nonconformist interests of civic and religious liberty in the turbulent period of reform.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">Likewise, another heterogeneous periodical, the <span class="title-periodical-PATRIOT"><i>Patriot</i></span> (<span class="date-1832-1866">1832–66</span>), 
                            which was operated jointly by interests of Congregationalists and Baptists, 
                            struggled to build adequate support on a nationwide subscriber base of Dissenters who upheld loyalty to voluntaryism on the question of Church Establishment, 
                            but who shrank from identifying with radical Dissent. The newspaperʼs trustees turned to the experienced journalist, <span class="persName-JCEDITOR">Josiah Conder</span> (<span class="date-1789-1855">1789–1855</span>), 
                            already editor of the <span class="title-periodical-ECLECTICREVIEW"><i>Eclectic Review</i></span>, to increase subscription, 
                            but the <span class="title-periodical-PATRIOT"><i>Patriot</i></span> nonetheless almost foundered along with its editor 
                            because <span class="persName-JCEDITOR">Conder</span> was perceived as too soft on the question of Establishment even in the view of moderates, 
                            must less of the radical voluntaryists (<a href="/notes/bibliography#COOPERPATRIOT" target="_self"><span class="persName-JNCOOPER">Cooper</span>, <span class="title-essay-COOPERPATRIOT">“Dissenters and National Journalism”</span></a>). 
                            Given that the weekly <span class="title-periodical-PATRIOT"><i>Patriot</i></span> and monthly <span class="title-periodical-ECLECTICREVIEW"><i>Eclectic</i></span> 
                            survived only by virtue of deft political and theological positioning, not to mention the hugely energetic labors of professional journalists like <span class="persName-JCEDITOR">Conder</span>, 
                            no wonder that the modest <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span> failed to summon adequate support. In the magazineʼs final 
                            issue, <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> attributed the failure to “want of encouragement” (see <a href="#REDISCOVERY">The Rediscovery of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs First Publication</a>). Add to this 
                            the scale of the competition, with four thousand journal titles estimated to have been founded in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span> 
                           <span class="date-1790-1832">between 1790 and 1832</span>, and <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> was soon forced to shut down the costly venture 
                            within the first year of his magazineʼs publication

                        <div class="p">Compared to these national political struggles, the conflicts staged in the <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span> 
                            are domestic in scale. In dueling correspondence on the “Religious Education of Children” contributed by “Rector” and “Cor‐Rector”, the former observes that 
                            “children of ministers turn out worse than others” for “when they do get into the world, they riot in it”. Having been “made to sit through a long form of worship before they can understand one word”, 
                            their overloaded “brains are turned”; and “growing older, and their wishes and desires expanding”, they nonetheless remain dangerously thwarted, “not allowed to read anything 
                            in a dramatic form,—good or bad,—nay” not even “any thing fictitious”. Cor‐Rector replies with an anecdote about a godly child who read Scripture from infancy, 
                            soon growing so fond of it that he became a prodigy. “As he grew older, and his desires expanding, what on earth could anything in a dramatic form benefit his mind, or the reading of any fictitious books? . . . 
                            Would not this supplant all the preceding labours bestowed on the child, and fill the library of his mind with gross fictions, and subverting from his heart in future days the fear of God, which was the beginning of his wisdom? . . . 
                            Hymn learning and hymn singing is charming, and more than refreshing from infants”. Rector considers such prodigies to be hypocrites. The argument goes nowhere, partly because the magazine stopped publication, 
                            but also because, despite the promise of the magazine to favor the “sprightly and elegant”, the editor declined from the start to speak courageously in favor of broad‐minded cultivation: 
                            according to the “Observations by the Editor” appended to Rectorʼs initial letter, “We insert the above letter because, in the main its assertions are just: 
                            but we think it dangerous to say any thing that might be mistaken as unfriendly to catechisms, 
                            and the learning of hymns, &c.; all of which, if not overdone, may be unspeakably useful” 
                            (“Rector”, “Letter concerning Severity of Religious Education” and “Observations by the Editor”; 
                            “Cor‐Rector”, “Religious Education of Children”; 
                            and “Rector” with rejoinder by “Cor‐Rector”, “Religious Education of Children”, in

                            conveys the quality of a hymn that is seldom detected in the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> juvenilia. The poem by the anonymous youth holds out comfort to “favourʼd souls”

                        These are the tombs she makes, and buries all / Beneath them, but the soul; that, . . . scorns the dust”.</div>

                            the tension between the magazineʼs embrace of both Romantic imagination and Evangelical otherworldliness appears to have set off a debate in

                            which similarly acquired an ending that “scorns the dust” of the “general grave”. If these fragments do represent the revision process, 
                            they must date from between <span class="date-1829-05-10">10 May 1829</span>, when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrote his letter presenting a fair copy of the poem to his father,
