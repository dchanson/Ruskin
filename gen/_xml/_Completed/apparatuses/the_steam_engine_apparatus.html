                        “day”. If the last three letters are <i>dar</i>, they probably refer to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs source, a

                        (see <a href="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</a>). The erased title, if that is what it is, perhaps belonged to the 
                        draft: other partial erasures beneath the text reveal apparently that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> copied a draft or semi‐final version here, in

                        and thereby singling out that work, possibly, as Ruskinʼs earliest surviving poem.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">On internal evidence, <span class="title-poem-JRTHESTEAMENGINE">“When furious up from mines the water pours” [“The Steam Engine”]</span> 
                        is more logically placed in <span class="date-1826-09-1826-12">late 1826</span> or 
                        <span class="date-1827-01-1827-04">early 1827</span>, since during that period, according to another annotation by his <span class="persName-MR">mother</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> completed the entirety of this <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self">Red Book</a> (see

                        <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus#DATE" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span>: Date</a>). In keeping with this interpretation, 
                        the content of the poem is consistent with the kinds of sources pervading the concluding chapters of 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I”</span></a>, which
                        precedes the anthology. Both the prose lesson and the poem reflect the preoccupations of Enlightenment educationists, 
                        and it is logical that, compositionally, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> maintained the theme of scientific and industrial optimism as he completed the prose lesson

                                <span class="title-poem-JRTHESTEAMENGINE">“When furious up from mines the water pours”</span> may have lain solely in the quotations 
                                found in <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>ʼs dialogue 
                                (<a href="/notes/bibliography#VILJOENPAPERS" target="_self">“Helen Gill Viljoen Papers”</a>, box D.V). 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> must have consulted the full passage on coining in <span class="title-poem-DARWINBOTANICGARDEN"><i>The Botanic Garden</i></span>, 
                                however, since his poem engages with numerous details of diction in <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs poem, 
                                which he could not have derived from either <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>ʼs or <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>ʼs selections alone.</div>
                           
                           <div class="p">In his adaptation, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> somewhat reorders the sequence of topics in the original, 
                                using less figurative language but also elaborating <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs pictures 
                                in his own way (for details, see the glosses to the <span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span> witness). 
                                Like <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> begins with the engine draining water from mines to expose the ore. 
                                Next, appearing to have misunderstood <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs 
                                figurative account of a bellows that imprisons “gales” of forceful wind, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> substitutes a literal storm in lines 2–3 of his poem, 
                                but in fact he has separated the figurative from its object, recurring to the bellows later in his list of useful applications of steam. 
                                Meanwhile, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intervenes in <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs sequence with steamboats, 
                                which rescue the victims of exploding steamboats—an ironic anecdote that seems to bemuse <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, 
                                and that effectively deflates the optimism of <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs futuristic peroration, which predicts the wonders of steam transport. 
                                Three decades on, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> seems to know better than <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span> whose aeronauts beckon from fanciful flying chariots. 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> corrects <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs anticipation of a time when steam shall “drag the slow barge”, 
                                remarking that the “smokey barge [is] called by us steam boat”.</div>
                           
                           <div class="p">Nonetheless, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> admits that steam is “the most useful engine brought to man”, 
                                and he returns to <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs list of wonders, if only to scramble its order again. 
                                Saving for later <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs pumps that fill cisterns and pipe water to “thirsty cities”, 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> presses on to <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs steam‐powered millstones, 
                                which enchant him for <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs rhyme of <i>whirl</i> and <i>twirl</i> 
                                (thrice repeated by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>). He has no use 
                                for <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs pitch for grain‐based vegetarianism, preferring to keep up the “twirling” 
                                by introducing instead <span class="persName-SRA">Arkwright</span>ʼs cotton spinning machine. 
                                The action of revolving seems to take over <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, as he continues with <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span> 
                                to describe the round coins minted by <span class="persName-MB">Boulton</span>ʼs machine 
                                (here he is taken by another of <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs rhymes, <i>squeeze</i> and <i>seize</i>); 
                                and he comes back to <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs water pumped to thirsty cities in order to 
                                send the water “round the town” and back again. Finally, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> clenches these revolutions 
                                with an original contribution—the picture of a chain that an engine has forged “link to link” and impressed with a floral design like a bracelet.</div>
                           
                           <div class="p">Formally, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> borrows <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs heroic couplets without the pomposity of what 
                                <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span> condemns in the preface to <span class="title-book-WORDSWORTHLYRICALBALLADS"><i>Lyrical Ballads</i></span> 
                                as the artifice of poetic diction. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> catches <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs livelier rhyme words, 
                                and the poetʼs energy and exuberance. Of course, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may simply have avoided a learnedness of diction that he did not understand 
                                at his young age; he shows a similar preference for poetic over pedantic terms in his
                                adaptation of <a href="/notes/bibliography#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES" target="_self"><span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>, <i>Scientific Dialogues</i></a>,

                                liked unusual words that could energize his writing; and perhaps the appeal for him of <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs poetry lay 
                                in the extraordinary fertility with which the poet invented words—a major factor in the success of 
                                <span class="title-poem-DARWINBOTANICGARDEN"><i>The Botanic Garden</i></span>, as suggested by <span class="persName-DGK">D. G. King‐Hele</span> 
                                in <a href="/notes/bibliography#KINGHELEDARWIN" target="_self">“Darwin, Man of Ideas and Inventor of Words”</a> (pp. 165–68).</div>
                           
                           <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may even have appreciated <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span> for a quality that, in the poetʼs own time, was a target 
                                for criticism—his tendency to make “every word picturesque”, as <span class="persName-RS">Robert Southey</span> characterized his diction, 
                                or “a succession of Landscapes or Paintings”, as <span class="persName-STC">S. T. Coleridge</span> viewed the poems, 
                                to the extent that temporal connection and development seemed to suffer. <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs friend in the town where he practiced medicine, 
                                the poet <span class="persName-">Anna Seward</span>, the “Swan of Lichfield”, agreed with this appraisal, 
                                but she perceived a virtue in <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs sacrifice of “intersticial space” between his images, 
                                and in his spatial rather than temporal, imagination (<a href="/notes/bibliography#PRIESTMANPOETRYOFDARWIN" target="_self"><span class="persName-MPRIESTMAN">Priestman</span>, <span class="title-book-PRIESTMANPOETRYOFDARWIN"><i>Poetry of Erasmus Darwin</i></span></a>, 34). 
                                <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span> may have helped form the taste on which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                                would later base his critique of the pathetic fallacy.</div>

                                As critics have argued, however, the conditions of the laborers who operated such machinery are ignored in <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs poetry, 
                                in which he causes the machines either to be driven by a dainty mythological crew or to seem to run themselves owing to intransitive verbs that allow for no other agency

                                The operation of <span class="persName-MB">Boulton</span>ʼs coin press is an exception to this obfuscation, in that the four boys are acknowledged in one of <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs 
                                characteristically expansive prose notes to the poem; however, <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs purpose in highlighting the boysʼ industry in 
                                “striking thirty thousand guineas in an hour” in their <span class="placeName-SOHO">Soho</span> workplace, near <span class="placeName-BIRMINGHAM">Birmingham</span>, 
                                is to award a “civic crown” to <span class="persName-MB">Boulton</span> for having achieved 
                                “such superior excellence and cheapness of workmanship, . . . as must totally prevent clandestine imitation, and in consequence save many lives from the hand of the executioner”

                                indicates that the Ruskins were rooted in the optimism of the British Enlightenment, which <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>ʼs poetry and polymathic interests 
                                represented, as well as being steeped in the Romanticism of <a href="/notes/scott_walter_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span> (1771–1832)</a>.
