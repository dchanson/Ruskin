                    suggests that someone interpreted the sheet as originally having been enclosed in a letter or as having
                    formed a kind of epistolary communication in itself—such as the <a href="/notes/new_years_poems_note" target="_self">New Yearʼs Poem</a> presentation copies, 
                    which are bound in <a href="/apparatuses/msxi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span></a>. 
                    The only evidence qualifying this manuscript as a communication of this kind are two horizontal folds of the sheet; nothing on the
                    reverse, in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <i>own</i> hand, indicates such an intention, 
                    although an annotation on the reverse in the hand of <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> may supply a clue (see <a href="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</a>).</div>

                    witness as “<span class="date-1827-02-1827-03"><span class="sic">febuary [sic]</span> or march 1827</span>”. On the reverse, another
                    hand, probably <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs, wrote “<span class="date-1827-02-16">16 Feb<sup>y</sup> 1827</span>”. 
                    Immediately above this date, the same hand wrote an obscure notation, “No [<i>or possibly</i> Mo] 6817”.</div>

                    suggests uncertainty, whether about a date of composition prior to this fair copy or about the 
                    date of the fair copy itself. The latter possibility, as if <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> returned later to add the date to the manuscript, 
                    seems eliminated by the fact that he wrote this date in the same hand and medium as that used for the manuscript as a whole: he wrote this date in pencil, 
                    rather than with pen and ink, which he had learned to use by the time he fair‐copied the poem in the 
                    <a href="/apparatuses/msiii_poetry_anthology_2_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-anthology-">MS III Second Poetry Anthology</span></a> (see

                     <div class="p">As more evidence that the annotation “<span class="date-1827-02-1827-03"><span class="sic">febuary [sic]</span> or march 1827</span>” is contemporaneous with the 
                    <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span> version, someone appears to have <i>erased</i> material in this copy, probably in order to make it 
                    accord with a change that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> made in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> fair copy (see gloss to line 4 of the poem). 
                    While the changes to the two manuscripts could have occurred in either sequence, it seems likelier that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> made the change while 
                    fair‐copying the poem in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>, using the <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span> version as his copytext, 
                    but making the erasure in <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span> when he discovered an error in verb tense.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">If the <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span> version is the earlier one, therefore, why did <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> so carefully add 
                    the conjectural date? An attractive hypothesis is that he was imitating <span class="persName-MR">his mother</span>ʼs similarly tentative manner
                    of dating in her notation of <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>, 
                    “this book begun about <span class="date-1826-09-1826-10">Sep<sup>t</sup> or Oct 1826</span> / finished about <span class="date-1827-01">Jan<sup>y</sup> 1827</span>”. 
                    If the date “<span class="date-1827-02-16">16 Feb<sup>y</sup> 1827</span>” is correct, which was written, probably by <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>, 
                    on the reverse of the <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span> witness, the original text was composed only a few weeks after 
                    <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> made that annotation to <span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">If this hypothesis is correct, and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was imitating <span class="persName-MR">his mother</span>ʼs dating

                    may be roughly contemporaneous with the final items that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> inserted in <a href="/apparatuses/msi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>—that is, 
                    those items that may have chronologically followed <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs inscription. This convergence is especially notable respecting the drawing on the inside of the back endboard of

                    dated <span class="date-1827-03-21">21 March</span> (provided that date refers to <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, and not <span class="date-1826">1826</span>). 
                    The convergence may also apply to the poems that are physically situated following <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs dating notation amid the items making up

                    might also be included here as a later witness of the <span class="date-1827">1827</span> poem. Beyond the first three lines, however, the <span class="date-1828-1829">1828–29</span> poem differs so
                    substantially that it should be treated as a distinct work. In the later poem, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs intentions have shifted toward expressing a patriotism that is
                    wholly absent from the earlier work, and that considerably expands the length and rhetorical range of the poem. At the same time, some rhetorical features of
                    the earlier poem remain present in the later one, if not identically expressed, such as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs interest in relevant sizes and distances. The <span class="date-1827">1827</span> and
                    <span class="date-1828-1829">1828–29</span> pieces raise an interesting case for probing the distinction between <i>work</i> and <i>witness</i>, and it
                    is quite possible to see <span class="date-1828-1829">1828–29</span> as part of the unfolding intentions of one witness to another, in a very open‐ended conception of a single work called “The Ship”.</div>
