                            it seems likely that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had devoted the latter part of this period&#x2014;perhaps, 
                            <span class="date-1826-12-01-1827-01-01">December through January</span>&#x2014;to fair&#x2010;copying and/or composing the poetry anthology,

                            It is also possible that, as suggested by a change in narrative style midway in the text of <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</span>, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have drafted the opening portion at an earlier period (see <a href="#SOURCES">Discussion: Sources</a>).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">According to the narrative of Volume 1, while <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> 
                            are visiting the seaside resort of <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span>, <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span> 
                            identifies the fourth day of their visit as &#x201C;the longest day&#x201D;, a remark that <span class="persName-HGV">Helen Gill Viljoen</span> interpreted 
                            as referring to the summer solstice (which fell on <span class="date-1826-06-21">June 21 in 1826</span> and on <span class="date-1827-06-21">June 22 in 1827</span>). 
                            <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> infers that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s composition date for Volume 1 must therefore be extended well past 
                            the terminus a quo of <span class="date-1827-01">January 1827</span> established by <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s gloss on

                            (&#x201C;Dating MSS. of Boyhood&#x201D;, in <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#VILJOENPAPERS");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-archive-VILJOENPAPERS">Viljoen Papers</span></a>, boxes D.V, E.IX).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> discounted the possibility that <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span>&#x02BC;s remark 
                            refers to a holiday that, in real life, had already occurred, in <span class="date-1826-06">June 1826</span>, 
                            before <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> started work on <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a> 
                            according to <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s gloss. 
                            She rejected this interpretation presumably on the grounds that the family could not have holidayed at the seaside in <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> 
                            during <span class="date-1826-06">June 1826</span>, if they had already departed for 
                            <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/perth_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>, <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span></a>, 
                            shortly after <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s birthday on <span class="date-1826-05-10">May 10</span>. 
                            It is now known, however, that the family must have delayed a vacation that year, since <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> 
                            traveled for customer orders well past his birthday (see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/tours_of_1826-27_note.php");?>" target="_self">Tours of 1826&#x2013;27</a>). 
                            It is thus more plausible that, insofar as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drew on actual events that occurred at <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> 
                            to help form his tale, he referred to a trip of <span class="date-1826-06">June 1826</span>, a few months prior to when <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> notes that he began work on

                            occurring in &#x201C;the spring of 1826&#x201D;, but a visit to the seaside so early in the year is unlikely &#x005B;<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#WGCLIFEOFJR1893");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>, <span class="title-book-WGCLIFEOFJR1893"><i>The Life and Work of John Ruskin</i> &#x005B;1893&#x005D;</span></a>, 1:25;

                            While such a scenario can be dovetailed with <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s dating of <span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span> by imagining

                            merely saved that material for the second volume. It is also possible that, as proposed in <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/tours_of_1826-27_note.php");?>" target="_self">Tours of 1826&#x2013;27</a>,

                  <div class="p">No draft survives of volume 1 of <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</span>, but the text in <span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span> shows indications that it is a fair copy based on a lost draft.
                            Given <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s attention to the physical appearance of his text, it is not credible that he could have composed and fair&#x2010;copied the text simultaneously 
                            in this <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/red_book_note.php");?>" target="_self">Red Book</a>, <span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span>. 
                            His attention to the material forms of his models was minute. For his title page, he not only imitated the layout of the printed title page of 
                            <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/edgeworth_harry_and_lucy_concluded_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-ME">Maria Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span></a>; he also copied the letterforms of the serif typefaces used in printing that text as well as 
                            <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><i>Frank: A Sequel</i></span>, both of which were published by Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy. 
                            (For <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s copies of these published texts, see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/boyhood_books_note.php#DESCRIPTIONS");?>" target="_self">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Physical Descriptions</a>.) 
                            He extended his use of these letterforms to pattern decorative capitals used throughout his text (see also 
                            <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/hand_note.php#RUSKINSHANDEARLYPRINTPENCIL");?>" target="_self">The Ruskin Family Handwriting: <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s Early Print Lettering in Pencil</a>). 
                            Besides this exacting attention required for fair&#x2010;copying, further evidence of a probable lost draft is suggested by insertions in the fair&#x2010;copy text, 
                            which are most convincingly explained as correcting errors of transcription, rather than as second thoughts in original composition 
                            (for details, see the textual glosses appended to the <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_msi.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span> witness</a>).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Composition may have entailed two distinct stages of draft. While the four or five months comprised by <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s dating of <span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span> 
                            could account for fair&#x2010;copying and perhaps some simultaneous drafting of 
                            <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy Concluded . . . Vol 1&#x201D;</span> and

                            (see <a href="#DATEOFCOMPOSITIONVOL1">Date of Composition: Volume 1</a>), internal evidence suggests that chapter 1 of the prose narrative 
                            may be based on a distinctly earlier stage of composition. At the start of chapter 2, the narrative exhibits an abrupt shift 
                            from direct dialogue to third&#x2010;person narration. For the first time in the text, a narrator addresses the reader, and the dialogue carries such tags as 
                            &#x201C;said her <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMA">mother</span>&#x201D; and &#x201C;answered her <span class="persName-fictional-PAPA">father</span>&#x201D;. 
                            Moreover, the shift in narrative technique is accompanied by new characters appearing on the scene. In chapter 1, 
                            the dialogue is limited to <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMA">Mamma</span>, whereas <span class="persName-fictional-PAPA">Papa</span> is said to be away from home in the City. 
                            In chapter 2, <span class="persName-fictional-PAPA">Papa</span> comes home, has a brief exchange with <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span>, and then, as the narrator informs us, 
                            &#x201C;<span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> has gone to bed 
                            and we shall have time to attend to <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">harry</span> whose history we have hitherto forgot&#x201D;.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Two stages of composition also are suggested by the sources behind the text. Following the change in narrative technique in chapter 2, 
                                the exchanges between characters&#x2014;which tend to be three&#x2010;way between <span class="persName-fictional-PAPA">Papa</span>, <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span>, and <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span>, largely excluding <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMA">Mamma</span>&#x2014;appear to be 
                                modeled predominantly on <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><i>Frank: A Sequel</i></span> and <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span>. In chapter 1, the evidence of adaptation from these texts is less certain. 
                                A likelier inspiration for chapter 1 may be <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/barbauld_anna_laetitia_note.php");?>" target="_self">Anna Laetitia Barbauld</a>&#x02BC;s 
                                <span class="title-book-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span>. Like <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s conversations between <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMA">Mamma</span> in chapter 1, <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>&#x02BC;s dialogues consist largely of direct discourse 
                                without intervention by a narrator. <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>&#x02BC;s influence may also have contributed to the feminine gendering of the subjects in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s first chapter,
                                along with allocation of a preceptorial role to <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMA">Mamma</span>, whereas the more masculine emphasis in chapter 2 and afterward&#x2014;notable in the preceptorial 
                                role shifting to the father, and indeed in the near erasure of <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMA">Mamma</span>, though not of <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span>, from the dialogues&#x2014;reflect <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s emphasis 
                                on the mentorship of <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> by his father, and of <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-LUCYME">Lucy</span> by their father along with avuncular figures like <span class="persName-fictional-RUPERTDIGBYME">Sir Rupert Digby</span>.</div>

                            Judging by textual traces in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s dialogues that can be specifically identified, the most prominent of these sources for <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I&#x201D;</span> were the 
                            final volumes in the Edgeworths&#x02BC; series (authored fully by <span class="persName-ME">Maria</span>), <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><i>Frank: A Sequel to Frank in Early Lessons</i></span>, and <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded, Being the Last Part of Early Lessons</i></span>, 
                            along with <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><i>Scientific Dialogues</i></span>, which is frequently referenced likewise in <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s final volumes of &#x201C;Early Lessons&#x201D;. 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s adaptation was therefore up to date. When he began Volume 1 of his own <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy Concluded&#x201D;</span> 
                            in <span class="date-1826">1826</span>, <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s book of that title, the latest and last in the series of &#x201C;Early Lessons&#x201D;, 
                            had been published just the previous year, in <span class="date-1825">1825</span>, while <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><i>Frank: A Sequel</i></span>, was also recent, first published in <span class="date-1822">1822</span>. 
                            The Ruskins owned these books in first&#x2010;edition copies, which survive. The copy of <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><i>Frank: A Sequel</i></span> contains more marginalia from early boyhood than does the surviving copy 
                            of <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span>, which contains some possible markings from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s youth but mostly marginalia from his maturity

                            It would have been in keeping with these educators&#x02BC; plan for age&#x2010;specific reading for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> to have patterned his chapter 1 
                            on more elementary reading. Although none of the youthful marginalia and drawings in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s surviving boyhood books can be dated, 
                            the physical evidence suggests that he did at least read <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><i>Frank: A Sequel</i></span> prior to grappling with the advanced <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span>

                            The heavier use evident in his copy of <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><i>Frank: A Sequel</i></span> indicates that, at age seven, he was just inside the scope of ages seven to ten or eleven that <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span> intended for this book.

                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-AFYFE">Aileen Fyfe</span> has compared the dialogues in <span class="persName-JAIKIN">Aikin</span> and <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span> 
                                to those in <span class="persName-STRIMMER">Sarah Trimmer</span>&#x02BC;s ((<span class="date-1741-1810">1741&#x2013;1810</span>)) 
                                <span class="title-book-TRIMMEREASYINTRODUCTION"><i>An Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature, and Reading the Holy Scriptures, Adapted to the Capacities of Children</i></span> (<span class="date-1780">1780</span>) 
                                in order to highlight the differences in pedagogical approach to science, as adopted respectively by Unitarian and by Church of England children&#x02BC;s authors in the late eighteenth century. 
                                Seeking to understand particularly the effect of these approaches on readers, <span class="persName-AFYEE">Fyfe</span> suggests that <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span> and <span class="persName-JAIKIN">Aikin</span> inspired child readers to become active inquirers. 
                                In the dialogues in <span class="title-book-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings</i></span>, the fictional children take the initiative in prompting dialogue with their adult interlocutors, 
                                and they freely make observations, hazard connections, and draw conclusions. <span class="persName-STRIMMER">Trimmer</span>&#x02BC;s fictional children, in contrast, 
                                are passively guided by their mother, whose voice dominates the text. She directs the children&#x02BC;s attention to natural phenomena 
                                and tells the children what to think about them, using the terms of natural theology. The difference reflects a philosophical clash 
                                between a Rousseauist belief in enfranchising children to discover the world for themselves,
                                and a conservative Christian commitment to guard children against sinful influences, from both within the self and without. 
                                <span class="persName-JAIKIN">Aikin</span> and <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span> encourage discovery and curiosity regarding a wide variety of subjects, which includes science 
                                for both boys and girls, albeit to distinct ends. <span class="persName-STRIMMER">Trimmer</span> prioritizes religious teaching, embracing natural history only as a means 
                                to inspire awe in the revelation of God&#x02BC;s design for the world, while ruling out scientific learning 
                                that is unmediated by religion as dangerous and likely overly abstruse as well

                                but there is no evidence specifically of books of natural history that take <span class="persName-STRIMMER">Trimmer</span>&#x02BC;s approach (see

                                the tone suggests that he absorbed the stance of <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span> and <span class="persName-JAIKIN">Aikin</span>&#x02BC;s uninhibited inquirer. 
                                In volume 1, chapter 1, which, as proposed in <a href="#COMPOSITION">Composition</a>, 
                                probably reflects the most direct influence of <span class="title-book-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span>, <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> takes the initiative in directing the topic and development of discourse. 
                                She declares what she will do: outside the house, she will visit her rabbit; inside the house, she will draw a head. 
                                While <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMA">Mamma</span> imposes checks on willfulness (<span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> cannot go outside in the rain; inside, she should &#x201C;do one thing at once&#x201D; 
                                and finish her landscape before drawing the head), <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> easily diverts <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMA">Mamma</span> from captious control. 
                                <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMA">Mamma</span> does wrest the lead in conversation by inquiring about the condition of <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span>&#x02BC;s silkworms&#x2014;a topic that leads to 
                                an opening to quiz <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> on addition. But <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> turns the tables and stumps her mother with abstruse questions about silkworms&#x2014;the 
                                answers to which  <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMA">Mamma</span> might have known had she read <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span> as carefully as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> evidently has done. 
                                In short, this is a household of surprises, which can catch up both <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> and  <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMA">Mamma</span>: before <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> can draw anything, she must find her pencils,

                                <span class="persName-AFYFE">Fyfe</span> remarks that, whereas in the <span class="date-1790">1790s</span> the progressive Unitarian pedagogical methods in <span class="title-book-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span> raised alarms among Church of England book reviewers, including Mrs. <span class="persName-STRIMMER">Trimmer</span>,

                                By this time, readers&#x02BC; responses to <span class="title-book-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span> had shifted, as shown by testimony of Victorians who were born around  <span class="date-1820">1820</span>, and who, like <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, 
                                treasured their childhood memories of <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span> and <span class="persName-JAIKIN">Aikin</span>&#x02BC;s book. <span class="persName-AFYFE">Fyfe</span> takes this record of response as proof that the authors&#x02BC; policy of avoiding direct

                                Similarly, the <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworths</span> avoided potentially devisive religious topics in their educational dialogues,

                            and when <span class="persName-fictional-PAPA">Papa</span> comes home at the start of chapter 2, his presence significantly eclipses <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMA">Mamma</span>&#x02BC;s role as interlocutor in the text. 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> even neglects to make a place for <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMA">Mamma</span> in the seating arrangements of the traveling carriage that carries the family on the excursion to <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> (see contextual glosses for volume 1). 
                            At the beach, <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMA">Mamma</span> is represented as a voice calling <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span> to lessons, a voice he &#x201C;did not hear&#x201D; and &#x201C;staid away a whole hour later than he should&#x201D; (chap. 10). 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s desire for his real father during <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s lengthy business travels can therefore be taken as a powerful emotion animating his adaptation of the lesson in dialogue form, 
                            just as he makes that desire an explicit theme in the poems that fill the remaining space 
                            in his <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</span> Red Books (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/msii_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span></a>, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/msiii_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a>, and <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/msiiia_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIIIA">MS IIIA</span></a>; and see, e.g., <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/on_papas_leaving_home_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRONPAPASLEAVINGHOME">&#x201C;On Papa&#x02BC;s Leaving Home&#x201D;</span></a> and <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/monastery_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span></a>). 
                            At the same time, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s adaptation of the dialogue form to represent domestic life at <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> delivers at times convincing and lively exchanges between his female characters, 
                            <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMA">Mamma</span>.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">While <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s narrative can be read biographically for an emotional truth, his <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</span> is strikingly embedded in its textual origins, 
                            albeit creatively so. <span class="persName-AFYFE">Aileen Fyfe</span> comments that the appeal of eighteenth&#x2010; and nineteenth&#x2010;century books of science for children 
                            lay in the practical applications that readers could undertake in real life (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#FYFETRACTS");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-FYFETRACTS">&#x201C;Tracts, Classics and Brands&#x201D;</span></a>, 213). In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</span>, 
                            however, the dialogues often seem less a record of &#x201C;early lessons&#x201D; put in practice at <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> than a fantasized praxis at one remove&#x2014;<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span> 
                            enacting imaginatively what <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s, <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>&#x02BC;s, and <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>&#x02BC;s fictional children do. Certainly, some portions of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s narrative can be most convincingly explained in terms of direct experience 
                            (see <a href="#TRAVEL">&#x201C;Records of the Ruskin Family Travel&#x201D;</a>). But a number of the scientific experiments lifted from <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span> and <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span> 
                            were obviously too exotic or dangerous to have been been permitted to disturb the peace of <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> 
                            (e.g., <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> tending to silkworms, or <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span> setting off gunpowder); and specialized apparatus such as the air pump, though omnipresent in the world 
                            of <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-LUCYME">Lucy</span>, seems unlikely to have been household objects in <span class="placeName-CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</span>. <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s 
                            meticulous household accounts reveal largesse with books for the library but nothing for a laboratory.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Nonetheless, the bookish quality of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s appropriation of experiments may in itself shed light on a biographical connection.

                            She wrote the book for the edification of women, particularly as a preliminary foundation for fashionable women 
                            who attended the public lectures designed to introduce the British public to abstruse scientific topics 
                            but which too often only bewildered their audiences with terminology and concepts over their heads 
                            (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#MARCETCONVERSATIONSONCHEMISTRY");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-JMARCET">Marcet</span>, <span class="title-book-MARCETCONVERSATIONSONCHEMISTRY"><i>Conversations on Chemistry</i></span></a>, 1:v&#x2013;x). The complaint is dramatized in an episode by <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span> 
                            in which a pompous lecturer on astronomy puts an audience of children to sleep 
                            &#x201C;listening to a vast number of words . . . of which nearly half were nothing to the purpose&#x201D;. Even an eager boy like <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span>,

In his earlier days in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> often attended lectures; 
                            and it seems consistent with his habits of self&#x2010;culture that, as an aspiring wine merchant, he would have educated himself 
                            in a basic course of chemistry; and that he would have acquired <span class="persName-JMARCET">Marcet</span>&#x02BC;s popular text, regardless of its specified female audience, 
                            to privide a foundation of concepts and glossary of technical terms. What this opening on <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s scientific self&#x2010;culture may reveal 
                            is a scenario for father and son&#x02BC;s&#x2014;and mother&#x02BC;s&#x2014;home schooling with these scientific dialogues as shared texts. See

               <div class="p">How the Ruskins may have employed these educational texts as a family is lost to us, but <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s

                            to a fantastical episode in volume 1 of <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</span>,

                            may also have been based on a material object, a puppet show. While the construction described by <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span> 
                            suggests a homemade project, it may have been based on or incorporated a product commonly available in stationers&#x02BC; shops in the first half of the century.

                                was based, one suspects, on extending the charm of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s description of boyhood travels in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span> to the travel narratives from fifty years earlier. 
                                He ignored, or was not aware, that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s model, the original <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i> Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span> by <span class="persName-ME">Maria Edgeworth</span>, likewise contains 
                                a lengthy account of a domestic tour&#x2014;perhaps the first travel narrative that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> read as a youth, 
                                apart from adventure tales such as <span class="title-book-DEFOEROBINSONCRUSOE"><i>Robinson Crusoe</i></span>. <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s child characters accompany their parents 
                                for a lengthy sojourn at a seaside cottage, just as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</span> visit one of the seaside resorts that were attracting

                                <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s family travels from the northwest of <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span> to the southwest coast near <span class="placeName-BRISTOL">Bristol</span>, stopping along the way at 
                                sites showcasing <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>&#x02BC;s industrial achievements from the late eighteenth century.

                                taking in highlights of picturesque landscape. While differing in emphasis, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s travelogue derives structural elements 
                                from <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s book to frame the journey, and he also imports some entirely fictional details.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">As explained in the contextual glosses to <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">volume 1</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> borrowed from <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s narrative to describe his <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span>&#x02BC;s excited departure for the seacoast. 
                                An adaptation from <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span> is probably also responsible for an awkward segue where <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drops his travel narrative because his <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span> is &#x201C;determined to go on with science&#x201D;&#x2014;a

                                While <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span> of course does not plagiarize from <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>, the seacoast destination of her fictional family seems nearly incidental 
                                to the educational goal of the journey, which is to enhance the children&#x02BC;s &#x201C;practical education&#x201D; 
                                with on&#x2010;site demonstrations of industry and science that they would otherwise have to gather from books. 
                                Along the road south to <span class="placeName-BRISTOL">Bristol</span>, they tour mills and factories in the <span class="geogName-MIDLANDS">Midlands</span> to understand how the industries are powered and organized. 
                                When settled in their seaside cottage, the children are ascribed a single episode of sublime encounter with the sea; 
                                otherwise, their main attraction is access to the extensively equipped &#x201C;workroom&#x201D; and library at Digby Castle, 
                                the residence of their seaside landlord, <span class="persName-fictional-RUPERTDIGBYME">Sir Rupert Digby</span>. The castle offers fabulous opportunities for applied learning&#x2014;a 
                                sort of nineteenth&#x2010;century Epcot Center set inside a Disney castle featuring Gothic Revival exhibits such as a great hall and a hermitage. 
                                <span class="persName-fictional-RUPERTDIGBYME">Sir Rupert</span> is an idealized master of ceremonies, an avuncular character who oversees a largesse of books and scientific equipment. 
                                Thus, when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> determines that his <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span> must &#x201C;go on with science&#x201D;, he is not just filling space, but imitating the focus of <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s children 
                                on experiments in <span class="persName-fictional-RUPERTDIGBYME">Sir Rupert</span>&#x02BC;s wonderful workroom, where the &#x201C;favourite book&#x201D; of <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span>, <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><i>Scientific Dialogues</i></span>, 
                                &#x201C;assisted&#x201D; him in his investigations (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>, <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span></a>, 3:319).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Yet, while <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> relies on <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s tale for ways to frame his travelogue (and borrows directly from <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span> 
                                for an exciting episode involving an exploding wagon, which occurs along the road to <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span>), his account of <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span> at <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> 
                                fundamentally differs from his source in its relish for the seashore and the surrounding cliffs. 
                                Apart from the series of experiments copied from <span class="persName-">Joyce</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s account reflects little of <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s educational program. 
                                Instead, his narrative aligns convincingly with multiple travel guides to <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> from the period, 
                                without copying directly from them. As detailed in the contextual glosses, <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span>&#x02BC;s walks with his <span class="persName-fictional-PAPA">Papa</span> on the heights above the town 
                                follow the topography of the place; and his activities in a boat, on the shore, and in a hotel 
                                reflect the tourism industry in <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> of the <span class="date-1820">1820s</span>. Sowewhat less clearly recognizable, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s description of the road trip 
                                from <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> to the coast is at least reconcilable with the route through <span class="placeName-TUNBRIDGEWELLS">Tunbridge Wells</span> that the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> family probably followed. 
                                There survives no independent evidence to confirm the fact or the dates of this journey (see 
                                <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/tours_of_1826-27");?>" target="_self">Tours of <span class="date-1826-1827">1826&#x2013;27</span></a>). 
                                Nonetheless, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s account of the visit to <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> proper, as opposed to how he frames the beginning and end of the visit, is not carried out 
                                    in a laboratory but through activities associated with the picturesque&#x2014;viewing, walking, collecting, drawing. 
                                    While <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> too readily assumed that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s tale recorded experience &#x201C;to the life&#x201D; with just the names changed, 
                                his instinct was sound for the authenticity of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s engagement with the picturesque tour, which corresponds to the recommendations 
                                of <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> guidebooks of the period but is not copied from those sources, so far as presently discovered.</div>
