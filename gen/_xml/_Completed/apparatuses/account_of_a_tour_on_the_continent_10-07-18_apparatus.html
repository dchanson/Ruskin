                        <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> printed the title, 
                        <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</span>, without square brackets, his symbol for declaring editorial intervention. 
                        Nonetheless, the title apparently originated with him, as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> assigned no title to the 
                        sequence as a whole in any of the extant manuscripts 
                        (see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891");?>" target="_self"><i>Poems</i> &#x005B;4<sup>o</sup>, 1891&#x005D;</a>, 1:119, 281;

                        Accordingly, in <i>ERM</i>, when the main title is fully spelled out, it is given without quotation

                        In commentary about the work, however, for convenience in the course of discussion, a short title is used with quotation marks (i.e., the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>) 
                        in order to avoid confusion with surrounding text.</div>

                        According to an annotation in the hand of <span class="persName-AW">Alexander Wedderburn</span>, after the time when <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span>

                        There remains in the manuscript a blank page (11r) followed by a stub of a leaf where a title for the

                        referred to individual poems, each named for the place described in the poem. Later, when he expanded the work by adding prose essays

                        but this practice was not carried out consistently. Some of these editorial titles are very convincingly what <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had in mind, based on internal evidence; 
                        others were probably a guess. The editors appear not to have made studious use of the most authoritative source of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s titles for sections he left incomplete or undrafted&#x2014;his

                        take him at his word that the removed pages were completely blank.) Since <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> does not specify 
                        (and may not have known) specifically which &#x201C;blank pages&#x201D; were removed, evidence may have been destroyed of how many blank leaves 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have left in various places to allow for insertion of text and/or drawings in portions of the

                        Rearrangement of drawings seems especially likely in the case of the gallery of untitled drawings that presently follows the page on which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        abandoned his fair copy of the text. He may have assembled this gallery himself after he gave up expectation of completing the fair copy, but it seems at least equally probable

                        which contains two manuscripts associated with the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>&#x2014;those 
                        designated in <i>ERM</i> as

                        These manuscripts were not originally contained in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>, but were collected and bound along 
                        with other miscellaneous manuscripts by the editors of the <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/library_edition_note.php");?>" target="_self">Library Edition</a> (see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/msia_apparatus.php#PROVENANCE");?>" target="_self">MS IA: Provenance</a>). 
                        Prior to this arrangement, <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> was familiar with these two manuscripts when editing the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, 
                        as indicated by various textual details in his copytext of poems published 
                        in <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/poems_1891_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i></span> (1891)</a>. 
                        He did not, however, document where and in what state he originally found them, and any such context was lost 
                        when they were later bound with the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> miscellany.</div>
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> also largely neglected to identify the source of his copytext for particular poems. 
                        Apart from his general rule of adopting copytext from previously published versions, where available (a rule that applied to only three poems from 
                        the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>), he drew on what he vaguely designated as &#x201C;originals&#x201D;. 
                        His sources can be reconstructed easily enough; for example, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g2.php");?>" target="_self">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</a>, 
                        is the sole extant source of two poems, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/passing_the_alps_poem_msia_g2.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span></a>

                        both of which are included in <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s version of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>. 
                        In the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>, for all its dependency on the <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/poems_1891_note.php");?>" target="_self"><i>Poems</i> (1891)</a>, 
                        <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> were more attentive than <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>  
                        in documenting the manuscript sources used for copytext or to identify variants. For example, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> 
                        rewrites a line of the poem <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</span>, justifying the innovation by what he considers &#x201C;neither rhyme nor reason&#x201D; 
                        in an unidentified &#x201C;original&#x201D; (i.e., MS IA, <i>g</i>.1). The faulty line, he decides, is a mis&#x2010;transcription of a line from a &#x201C;rough copy, now lost&#x201D;, 
                        the existence of which is entirely suppositious, but which he declares to have been somehow &#x201C;insufficiently altered&#x201D;. 
                        The editors of the the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> 
                        reject <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s rewritten line, finding merit in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;father&#x02BC;s copy&#x201D; of <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</span> 
                        (i.e., MS IA, <i>g</i>.1, which is partly in the hand of <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, with interlinear revisions by <span class="persName-">John</span>), 
                        and they cross&#x2010;check the line with <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;fair copy&#x201D; (MS IX)

               <div class="p"><span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s editorial approach to the &#x201C;<span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account</span>&#x201D; and its manuscripts values editorial intervention over documentary text, 
                        even though he cherishes manuscripts. Throughout the <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/poems_1891_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><span class="date-1891">1891</span> <i>Poems</i></span></a>, 
                        he consistently awards priority and adheres faithfully to previously published versions of texts&#x2014;in the case of copytext for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, 
                        deferring to earlier editors&#x02BC; interventions that resulted in texts as published in <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/friendships_offering_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span></a>

                        He pays comparatively little deference to texts as found in manuscripts, allowing himself latitude that presumably was taken by his predecessors, 
                        and holding himself to an editorial principle that can at best be summarized as aesthetic preference. Creative writing is justified, 
                        if he can discern &#x201C;neither rhyme nor reason&#x201D; in a line, and the design of the <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891">1891 <i>Poems</i></span> rules over the reconstruction of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, 
                        which is presented as a work solely in verse, despite <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s intentions for a composite verse, prose, and graphic work, as reflected in his fair copy. 
                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> labored to construct an accurate manuscript chronology in the <span class="title-bibliography_text-">&#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS of the Poems&#x201D;</span>, 
                        resulting in a deservedly influential document in the history of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> editing and manuscript curation, but his concept of an &#x201C;original manuscript&#x201D; 
                        entailed no responsibility to apply that chronology meaningfully to the editing of a given work by reconstructing its compositional history.</div>
               
               <div class="p">Thus, in editing the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> drew the main copytexts of <span class="title-poem-JRANDERNACHT">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</span> and 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRSTGOAR">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</span> from their publication as <span class="title-poem-JRFRAGMENTS">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</span>, 
                        subordinating their manuscript texts to endnotes containing what he calls their &#x201C;first sketch&#x201D; or &#x201C;first draft&#x201D; (the terms are apparently interchangeable), 
                        conceding that &#x201C;it may be interesting to compare the two versions&#x201D; (manuscript and publication) in order to show, &#x201C;if for nothing else, . . . that the young poet could polish when he chose, 
                        and that he would have eliminated the slipshod grammar and faulty rhymes if he had prepared the rest of his juvenile verses for publication&#x201D;. 
                        It seems not to have struck <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> that the interest in comparing published and manuscript versions lay, not in copyediting corrections (<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s manuscript texts, draft or fair copy, contain remarkably few errors of this kind), 
                        but in differences of diction, economy, and the respective projects to which the versions belonged. The term <i>first sketch</i> or <i>first draft</i> 
                        belies the manuscript versions of <span class="title-poem-JRANDERNACHT">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</span> and 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRSTGOAR">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</span>, which are not &#x201C;slipshod&#x201D; sketches or drafts but exacting fair copies&#x2014;the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> versions 
                        transcribed in a &#x201C;copperplate&#x201D; hand directly or indirectly from the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG1">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span>, versions, 
                        a manuscript that itself appears to be a presentation copy (purpose unknown). Regardless, for <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>, the varieties of manuscript textual witness 
                        collapse into &#x201C;originals&#x201D; versus &#x201C;polished&#x201D; versions, the former disarmed of textual authority and open to seemingly limitless editorial intervention, 
                        and the latter given unquestioned authority though abstracted from the social history of editors, publishers, and printers that bestowed the authority in the first place 
                        (what <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> supposedly would have wrought for himself, had he &#x201C;chose&#x201D;)

               <div class="p">In place of this missing textual history, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s edition substitutes a documentary history of artifacts, a &#x201C;study of these ancient Codices,

                        imparts the illusion of a textual history, satisfying &#x201C;a peculiar interest in watching development, in witnessing growth&#x201D;

                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> passed over the obvious choice of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s handmade illustrations for the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy, drawn in the manner of steel&#x2010;engraved vignettes, 
                        in favor of pencil sketches taken during the <span class="date-1833">1833</span> tour. For <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>, the correlative of a &#x201C;first sketch&#x201D; manuscript poem 
                        was a picturesque sketch taken on the spot; and an &#x201C;original&#x201D;, in word or picture, meant an experience. Ultimately, the story of &#x201C;development&#x201D; 
                        that he wishes to tell is the persistent presence of that experience (see <a href="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</a>).</div>

                            (see <a href="COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</a>). This important stint&#x2014;which consists largely of first drafts of poems 
                            relating to the Alpine and Italian stages of the tour, along with draft of prose that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was simultaneously folding 
                            along with the earlier&#x2010;composed poems on the Belgian and German stages into the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy&#x2014;can therefore be dated approximately 
                            between his fifteenth birthday on <span class="date-1834-02-08">8 February</span> and his <span class="persName-JJR">father</span>&#x02BC;s forty&#x2010;ninth birthday on <span class="date-1834-05-10">10 May</span>.</div>

                            the fact that the fifteenth and seventeenth items in the sequence form draft of the prose essay, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/brussels_prose_msviii.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-JRBRUSSELSPROSE">&#x201C;Brussels&#x201D;</span></a>

                            the full composite sections of verse, prose, and drawings for <span class="title-composite-JRCALAISCOMP">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</span>, &#x201C;<span class="title-composite-JRCASSELCOMP">Cassel&#x201D;</span>,

                            in <span class="date-1833-04">April 1833</span>, but it is absurd to imagine that it prompted <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s suggestion

                  <div class="p">The more elusive date is when the Ruskins acquired the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> edition of

                            as argued in <a href="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</a>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s 
                            <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> underwent a development similar to that of

                            from an all&#x2010;verse to a composite&#x2010;genre work. In the autobiography, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> admits that he has &#x201C;told this story so often&#x201D; about the influence of 
                            <span class="persName-SR">Roger</span>&#x02BC;s book and its revelation of <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s art, 
                            &#x201C;that I begin to doubt its time&#x201D;. In <span class="title-book-"><i>Praeterita</i></span>&#x02BC;s 
                            typically dramatizing fashion, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> declares that &#x201C;the main tenor of my life&#x201D; was set on 
                            <span class="date-1832-02-08">8 February 1832</span> by the birthday gift from his father&#x02BC;s business partner,

                            &#x201C;It is curiously tiresome that Mr. <span class="persName-HT">Telford</span> did not himself write my name in the book, 
                            and my father, who writes in it, &#x2018;The gift of <span class="persName-HT">Henry Telford</span>, Esq.,&#x2019;  
                            still more curiously, for him, puts no date: if it was a year later &#x005B;i.e., <span class="date-1833-02-08">8 February 1833</span>&#x005D;, no matter&#x201D;

                  <div class="p">In fact, the date range for acquaintance with <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> is even wider. 
                            In a non&#x2010;illustrated edition, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s poem had been in the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> household 
                            since <span class="date-1828">1828</span> at the latest (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#RFL");?>" target="_self">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 188 n. 4).
                            This happens to be the year when <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> published &#x201C;Part the Second&#x201D; of the poem; 
                            and growing disgusted over the work&#x02BC;s tepid reception, he bought out remaining copies of both that volume and &#x201C;Part the First&#x201D;, and destroyed them 
                            (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#ROGERSITALY1828");?>" target="_self">Rogers, <i>Italy</i> &#x005B;1828&#x005D;</a>;

                            and see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/samuel_rogers_note.php");?>" target="_self">Samuel Rogers &#x005B;1763&#x2013;1855&#x005D;</a>). 
                            Thus, even before <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s poem achieved popularity in the illustrated edition, 
                            the Ruskins could count themselves among the select number of appreciative readers of the work in its original form; 
                            and it is possible that <span class="persName-HT">Telford</span>&#x02BC;s gift of the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> edition contributed to the family&#x02BC;s travel plans even earlier than <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> remembered. 
                            The first mention of &#x201C;our Switzerlandish outlandish tour to Italy&#x201D; occurs in the family letters for <span class="date-1831-03">March 1831</span>, 
                            a month after <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s twelfth birthday (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#RFL");?>" target="_self">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 253).</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">More significant than the year when <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s work first helped to shape expectations for the journey, however, 
                            is a confirmation of its special influence immediately following the family&#x02BC;s return from the Continent. 
                            According to <span class="persName-VAB">Van Akin Burd</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> purchased a copy of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> 
                            in <span class="date-1833-10">October 1833</span>, notably soon after the family&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1833-09">September</span> return home 
                            (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#RFL");?>" target="_self"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 286 n. 1).
                            Actually, the October entry in <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s personal accounts ledger records a purchase that was germane specifically 
                            to the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> rather than to the Continental tour generally. 
                            The entry reads &#x201C;Plates Italy 28/6&#x201D; (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#RFMS28");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, Account Book &#x005B;1827&#x2013;45&#x005D;</a>, 29v); 
                            and although the lack of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s name renders identification uncertain, 
                            the term <i>plates</i> and the cost&#x2014;higher than the 1 &#x00A3;/1 s. cost of a copy of the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY1830"><i>Italy</i></span> in paper boards&#x2014;strongly suggest a portfolio of its plates alone. 
                            As <span class="persName-JPSCHOLAR">Jan Piggott</span> explains, &#x201C;the publishers of almost all the books illustrated with <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> vignettes 
                            made the engravings better known and made more profit by selling portfolios of prints from the plates. These were available in ranks of quality and price: 
                            engraver&#x02BC;s proofs; on India paper; before and after lettering; and on varying sizes of paper&#x2014;even on the absurdly large Colombier folio&#x2014;to satisfy the competitiveness of connoissures&#x201D; 
                            (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#PIGGOTTTURNERSVIGNETTES");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-book-"><i>Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes</i></span></a>, 24). 
                            While <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s strictly poetic influence on the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> was certainly considerable 
                            (see <a href="#ROGERSINFLUENCEONEXTENSION">The Influence of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s Poetry on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s Planned Extension of the Composite&#x2010;Genre Travelogue to <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> and <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span></a>), 
                            it was the ekphrastic influence of book illustration by <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>, <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>, 
                            <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>, and others, and the materiality of the print culture conveying their artistry, that particularly inspired <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s project, 
                            especially its expansion into a composite&#x2010;genre, illustrated version&#x2014;an expansion that mimics <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s own reconception of his work.</div>

                            He neglected to account for the fact that the title pages of <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/annuals_note.php");?>" target="_self">annuals</a> 
                            always carried the year following the actual year of publication, since they were produced for gift&#x2010;giving during the holiday season of Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s. 
                            In addition, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> was befuddled by his assumption that the second poem by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>

                            that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> might have written about a place he had never seen. In fact,<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> based his poem, 
                            not on first&#x2010;hand experience, but, like many writers commissioned to supply letterpress for the annuals, on an acquaintance with a place that extended no farther 
                            than the engraved vedute that they were hired to complement with their writing, and on whatever information they could glean from published sources.

               <div class="p">Along the way, the reader is occasionally referred to textual and contextual glosses that hang from the transcripts of certain witnesses,

                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> left the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> incomplete, 
                        abandoning the fair copy in mid&#x2010;sentence, with much existing draft remaining to be incorporated, and much more proposed composition to be undertaken 
                        according to his grand scheme for extension of the work (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii_contents.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-bibliography_text-">List of Proposed Additional Contents for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span></a>). 
                        Arguably, however, the work should be viewed less as the &#x201C;unfinished folly&#x201D; that 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> retrospectively mocked in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span> 
                        and more as a project exhibiting his rapid development as a writer (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE");?>" target="_self">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 35:81). 
                        The manuscripts show a work undergoing transformations, with each stage of development displacing the former. The <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> 
                        served its purpose by repeatedly capping its goals until the project was rendered obsolete by publication of poems derived from it, which announced the emergence of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s 
                        first significant public persona, <span class="persName-pen_name-JR">&#x201C;J.R.&#x201D;</span>.</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">The hypothesis advanced here is that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> developed the work in fairly distinct stages, from a verse travelogue 
                        in the eighteenth&#x2010;century topographical manner&#x2014;as represented by <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG1">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span>, 
                        a collaboration with <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>&#x2014;to a composite&#x2010;genre, illustrated travelogue that reflected the material culture 
                        surrounding the ekphrastic and travel&#x2010;related publishing of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. 
                        Finally, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> found himself being brought forward as a published author, credited with two works in the fashionable 
                        <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/annuals_note.php");?>" target="_self">literary and artistic annual</a>,

                        To form one of these published works, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRFRAGMENTS">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                        he revised a pair of poems selected from <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>. The title suggests a reversion 
                        to the initial conception of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> as a verse sequence. To form the second work, 
                        the topographical and travel poem, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                        he did not adapt material directly from the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, but he deployed strategies learned from the ekphrastic and composite&#x2010;genre character 
                        of the work&#x02BC;s advanced stage of composition. Draft of <span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span> also reveals <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        venturing to define a persona behind the initials <span class="persName-pen_name-JR">J.R.</span> attached to the published poems.</div>

                            and on the fact that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s sequence of drafting the prose essays that correspond to the five poems, as witnessed in the 
                            <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft, necessarily situates the <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span> texts 
                            as existing prior to both the drafts and the fair copies of these essays (see <a href="#COMPOSITEILLUSTRATEDTRAVELOGUEDRAFT">Drafting the Composite&#x2010;Genre Travelogue &#x005B;MS VII, VIII, XI&#x005D;</a>).</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">I interpret this manuscript as witnessing an all&#x2010;verse version of the travelogue, composed with some degree of collaboration by father and son. 
                            As discussed in <a href="#DATEOFCOMPOSITION">Date of Composition</a>, the manuscript is undated, and it remains an open question whether it was composed during 
                            the <span class="date-1833-05-1833-09">May&#x2013;September 1833</span> journey itself, or following the family&#x02BC;s return home around <span class="date-1833-09-20">20 September</span>.</div>

                            and in the hand of <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>. On the verso, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> continued with the poem,

                            <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</span> only on the grounds of the two poems&#x02BC; separation in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> 
                            fair copy). At line 19 of <span class="title-poem-JRCASSEL">&#x005B;&#x201C;Cassel&#x201D;&#x005D;</span>, <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s hand takes over 
                            (not <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s, whose terminal letters are typically formed differently than what prevails here). 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> carries the poem onto sheet 2 of the manuscript (evidence, along with their physical similarity, that the two sheets 
                            form a single manuscript), filling recto and verso with the continuation of <span class="title-poem-JRCASSEL">&#x005B;&#x201C;Cassel&#x201D;&#x005D;</span>,

                     <div class="p">The physical manuscript bears the appearance of a self&#x2010;standing fair copy, which was later subjected to revision. No other extant manuscript belonging to the 
                            <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> project consists solely of verse, and the arrangement of lines on the page indicates 
                            more care than in a draft. On sheet 1, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s large, eighteenth&#x2010;century hand takes up the full width for each line, 
                            and <span class="persName-JR">John</span> sustained his father&#x02BC;s single column, but in narrower scope and a smaller hand; however, on the verso of sheet 2, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">John</span> stacked the lines in double columns, as if imitating printed verse (although he inserted the final poem in the sequence, 
                            <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMEUSE">&#x201C;The Meuse&#x201D;</span>, sideways in space remaining on the recto of sheet 2, 
                            rather than starting a third sheet). The few substitutions&#x2014;all apparently in <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s hand, 
                            although not certainly so, especially in the case of overwriting&#x2014;are mostly interlinear, made as strikethroughs with insertions above or below the line, 
                            with only a few instances as in&#x2010;line revisions, suggesting that these changes formed a distinct stage of this manuscript&#x02BC;s development, 
                            following its original purpose as a fair copy. Moreover, in the margins of both sheets, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> numbered the lines of the poems sequentially and continuously (1&#x2013;173); 
                            that is, he did not begin his line numbering anew with each poem, suggesting that he regarded the poems as forming a sequence.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">It is possible that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> originally authored <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</span>

                            thereafter took over the composition, revising some of his <span class="persName-JJR">father</span>&#x02BC;s lines in the process. This scenario cannot be absolutely proven,

                            whereas his revisions of lines written originally in <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s hand occur solely as interlinear or overwriting,

                            The contents, unlike those of <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG1">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span>, are non&#x2010;sequential relative to the actual tour, 
                            but they do appear selected to represent the major regions into which the tour&#x02BC;s itinerary was broadly divided. The contents also mix genres, 
                            introducing a prose essay, which is placed first in the group: <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/calais_prose_msia.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-essay-JRCALAISPROSE">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</span></a>.

                            in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG1">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span>), there follow four poems, which seem to form two geographically related pairs:

                            representing the southern and Alpine regions that occupied the second half of the tour; and 
                            <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/andernacht_poem_msia.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRANDERNACHT">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</span></a> and

                            representing the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> journey that occupied the first half. It is not clear why the manuscript positions the two pairs in a topographical order 
                            that is the reverse of the family&#x02BC;s encounter with these places, as they journeyed down the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> 
                            to the <span class="geogName-BLACKFOREST">Black Forest</span>, and then crossed the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> and descended to the Italian lakes 
                            and <span class="placeName-MILAN">Milan</span>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">This suggestion of an organizational feature is conjectural, as no title identifies the five pieces as an entity, and the purpose of the manuscript is unclear. 
                            I interpret the manuscript as a sample or abstract of the fully developed composite&#x2010;genre work, but the occasion that prompted its creation is unknown. 
                            The manuscript is undated, but it must have pre&#x2010;dated the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy, 
                            which incorporates its corrections and substitutions in the prose essay, <span class="title-essay-JRCALAISPROSE">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</span>, 
                            and in the poems <span class="title-poem-JRANDERNACHT">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</span> and <span class="title-poem-JRSTGOAR">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</span>. 
                            The manuscript is the sole surviving witness for the other two poems, <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span> and 
                            <span class="title-poem-JRMILANCATHEDRAL">&#x201C;Milan Cathedral&#x201D;</span>, the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy 
                            having been abandoned toward the end of sections describing the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> journey, before the sequence could arrive at the 
                            crossing of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>. The manuscript&#x02BC;s place in the evolution of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> 
                            appears to be a transitional one between the all&#x2010;verse and the fully developed composite&#x2010;genre versions, 
                            since it contains not only a mix of genres (but no graphic illustrations) but also a selection of works about destinations that seems strategic. 
                            The audience and occasion of the manuscript will, however, probably always remain obscure.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">The manuscript also holds keys to tracing the influence of <span class="persName-SR">Samuel Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s poetry in 
                            <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, beyond the material influences of the volume&#x02BC;s 
                            organization, typography, and illustration. Although <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would develop these poetic influences more substantially afterward, in the 
                            <a href="#PROPOSEDCONTENTS">List of Proposed Additional Contents for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;</a>, and in poems corresponding 
                            to that plan that he drafted in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> 
                            (see <a href="#ROGERSINFLUENCEONEXTENSION">The Influence of Rogers&#x02BC;s Poetry on Ruskin&#x02BC;s Planned Extension of the Composite&#x2010;Genre Travelogue to Italy and Switzerland</a>), 
                            the poem <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span> reveals that, at this earlier stage, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            made a study of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s poem, <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</span>. 
                            He borrowed and elaborated on <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s historical trope of <span class="persName-HANNIBAL">Hannibal</span> struggling 
                            against the &#x201C;barrier&#x201D; of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>, and he perceived how the trope could serve as a structural pivot 
                            in a work&#x02BC;s larger organization&#x2014;between north and south, mountain and plain, the sublime and the beautiful. It is also probably no accident 
                            that the manuscript reflects <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s classical principles of complementary contrast in the pairing of the gothic poem, 
                            <span class="title-poem-JRANDERNACHT">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</span>, with the domestic poem, <span class="title-poem-JRSTGOAR">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</span>. 
                            <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> may also contributed to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s idea of pairing poems with essays. 
                            While <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> contains only a few prose essays, and the work is not arranged in composite&#x2010;genre sections, 
                            <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s copious prose notes to the poems were as important to the author as his meticulous verse (see 
                            <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#ROGERSJOURNAL");?>" target="_self">Hale, introduction to <i>The Italian Journal of Samuel Rogers</i></a>, 49&#x2013;50). 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s voice in the prose avoids <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s pedantry and seriousness, however; 
                            and while <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> may have suggested strategies for multi&#x2010;genre complexity, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s models for the prose lay elsewhere in the livelier letterpress writers for the annuals and travel books.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">In the ongoing process of composition of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG2">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span> 
                            must have been a precursor not only to the fair copy in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> (in which the opening section incorporates the prose essay, 
                            <span class="title-essay-JRCALAISPROSE">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</span>), but also to the draft of other poems and essays found in

                            dramatizes how these works served as imaginative and compositional cruxes for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>. The pairing of the poems, 
                            <span class="title-poem-JRANDERNACHT">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</span> and <span class="title-poem-JRSTGOAR">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</span>, 
                            was formed around a contrast of gothic sublime and domestic beauty, respectively, that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> carried forward to the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> 
                            fair copy (in which he elaborated the pairing with a third, middle section, <span class="title-composite-JREHRENBREITSTEINCOMP">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D;</span>, 
                            designed to bridge the contrasting modes using a geographical analogy of a confluence of two rivers, the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> and the 
                            <span class="geogName-MOSELLE">Moselle</span>). Ultimately, he refined the pairing for publication under the title, <span class="title-poem-JRFRAGMENTS">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</span>. 
                            In the pairing of <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span> and <span class="title-poem-JRMILANCATHEDRAL">&#x201C;Milan Cathedral&#x201D;</span>,

                            that of crossing a divide between natural and supernatural phenomena. The figure of a crossing that is humanly transformative appears to have been suggested to him

                     <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s aim in the composite&#x2010;genre project clearly was to imitate the print culture of travel literature of his day. 
                            For the text, he used a cursive &#x201C;copperplate&#x201D; hand, justified left and right. For the page layout, he adopted the plan of the 
                            <span class="date-1830">1830</span> edition of <span class="persName-SR">Samuel Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY1830"><i>Italy</i></span>, 
                            with a vignette&#x2010;style illustration placed at the top of the first page of each section, followed by the place&#x2010;name header (imitating even <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s 
                            choice of typeface and font), which serves to identify the section&#x02BC;s verse, prose, and additional illustrations&#x2014;all lacking titles of their own. In several instances, he drew illustrations in the manner of steel&#x2010;engravings, 
                            a new technology featured in <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY1830"><i>Italy</i> (1830)</span> and 
                            <span class="title-book-ROGERSPOEMS1834"><i>Poems</i></span> (<span class="date-1834">1834</span>) as well as in the <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/annuals_note.php");?>" target="_self">literary annuals</a>. 
                            Specifically, he followed <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> in heading sections with vignettes of landscape subjects, adapted directly or drawn after the manner of <span class="persName-JMWT">J. M. W. Turner</span>, 
                            and in concluding sections with vignettes of figure subjects, drawn in the manner of <span class="persName-TSP">Thomas Stothard</span>. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            also copied illustrations directly from <span class="persName-SP">Samuel Prout</span>&#x02BC;s lithographs for the  
                            <span class="title-artwork-PROUTSKETCHES"><i>Facsimiles of Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany</i></span> (<span class="date-1833">1833</span>), 
                            and in at least one instance he attempted to capture the watery appearance of lithography in contrast to the stipled pen strokes he used to imitate engraving. In some headpiece vignettes, 
                            <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s influence competed with <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            choosing architectural subjects over landscapes, and drawing these with <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s crumbly lines in contrast to the atmospheric effects of the Turneresque vignettes. 
                            Overall, in its graphic and &#x201C;typographic&#x201D; effects, the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy is much more varied and playful in its response 
                            to print culture than has usually been acknowledged. As both a work and an artifact, the fair copy represents an advance over the earlier manuscript instantiations 
                            of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> by exploring ekphrasis and topographical description as principles both of expansion and interrelation.

                            can be persuasively read as announcing a major theme of the following <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> draft&#x2014;<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s

                            culminating in the invocation of spiritual beings in the poem, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/chamouni_poem_msvii.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRCHAMOUNI">&#x201C;Chamouni&#x201D;</span></a>,

                            Evidence internal to <span class="title-poem-JROHARETHERESPIRITS">&#x201C;Oh are there spirits&#x201D;</span> suggests intertextual connections with the invocation of mountain spirits

                            The draft dedicated to the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> then remains unusually homogeneous, 
                            by the previous standard of this notebook, the draft becoming mixed with other works only after <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> has composed 
                            approximately twenty&#x2010;five items for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>. At that point, the draft 
                            becomes intermingled with poems related to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s upcoming <span class="date-1834-05-10">10 May 1834</span> birthday

                            While the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> sequence does represent the most extensive development of the composite&#x2010;genre version to survive in draft, 
                            <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> neglected to analyze how this manuscript must have been preceded by <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG1">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span> 
                            and <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG2">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span> in the genetic development of the work, even though he was familiar with these other manuscripts. 
                            In <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not, however, simply pick up where he had left off 
                            in composing verse and prose for the composite&#x2010;genre version, which he had conceptualized in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG2">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span> 
                            and begun compiling in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy. By starting the draft with the <span class="title-essay-JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</span>, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was casting forward to a projected conclusion of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>&#x2014;a 
                            complement to beginning <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span> with a prose essay,

                            The <span class="title-essay-JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</span> essay describes an episode that occurred 
                            at the end of the Ruskins&#x02BC; journey, their excursion to <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</span>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">In fact, the title, <span class="title-composite-JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</span>, may apply not only to the prose essay 
                            but also to the following untitled poem, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/i_woke_to_hear_the_lullaby_poem_msviii.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY">&#x201C;I woke to hear the lullaby&#x201D;</span> &#x005B;&#x201C;The Arve at Chamouni&#x201D;&#x005D;</a>, 
                            which, as <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s invented title correctly indicates, describes the <span class="geogName-ARVE">Arve River</span> 
                            flowing through the valley of <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</span>. In other words, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> probably intended his title as a section heading. 
                            This increased complexity in composition is significant, not only as additional proof that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> took up 
                            <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> at a stage when he had already conceived of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> 
                            as a composite&#x2010;genre work, but also as an indication of the thematic coherence he imagined for the work, although he never completed the fair copy.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">The hike to the glacier source of the <span class="geogName-ARVERON">Arveron River</span> was a popular activity for tourists in <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</span>. 
                            In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s telling, the excursion suggests a quest for poetic origins: led by local children acting as guides, 
                            the walk to the &#x201C;source&#x201D; reveals a <span class="name--HIPPOCRENE">Hippocrene</span>&#x2010;like, spiritual place of inspiration. 
                            In this notion of a spiritual poetic source, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drew together multiple ideas, including the trope of crossing mountains 
                            into a sacred bourne, a theme that he had already broached in <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span>, 
                            based on Alpine sections of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> by

                            Moreover, as explained in <a href="#SOURCES">Discussion: Sources and Influences</a> and <a href="#MENTORS">Mentors</a>, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s recent correspondence with the writer <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/hogg_james_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-JH">James Hogg</span> (ca. 1770&#x2013;1835)</a>,

                            as an act of poetic mentoring, prompted in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> a pastoral &#x201C;reverie&#x201D; about poetry and place. 
                            It is owing to this spiritualization of the journey at the start of the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft that a case can be made 
                            for counting <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/oh_are_there_spirits_can_there_be_poem_msviii.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JROARETHERESPIRITS">&#x201C;Oh are there spirits, can there be&#x201D;</span></a>,

                            may have been the first in the entire sequence of composing the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> to reflect 
                            <span class="persName-SR">Samuel Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s influence as a poet, as distinct from the influence of the print culture associated with the

                            in <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> as a summary reflection on the experience of crossing the mountains

                            that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intended <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span> to serve 
                            as a fulcrum between a cluster of pieces about the approach to the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> from <span class="placeName-SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</span>, 
                            and a cluster about the crossing at <span class="geogName-SPLUGEN">SplÃ¼gen</span>. The latter cluster was to consist of pieces or composite sections entitled

                            all of which are represented by poems in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft (see <a href="APPARATUSTABLE1">Table 1</a>). 
                            <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> situates <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</span> as a retrospective reflection 
                            on the experience of crossing, rather than a prospective one as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> planned, but it is clear that the younger poet modeled his sequence 
                            on <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s approach to the mountains. (In <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, 
                            the approach plays out topographically coming from the west, in the poems <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEGREATSTBERNARD">&#x201C;The Great St. Bernard&#x201D;</span> and 
                            <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEDESCENT">&#x201C;The Descent&#x201D;</span>, rather than coming from the north as the Ruskins did.) 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poems lack the pedantic historical references with which <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> 
                            labors his verse; instead, the youth (who was in any case inadequately learned to make such allusions) allowed the verse to unfold by tracing the landscape itself, 
                            coupling the description, if with anything, with a reverential topic, such as the sabbath setting of 
                            <span class="title-poem-JRALPSFROMSCHAFFHAUSEN">&#x201C;There is a charmed peace, that aye&#x201D; &#x005B;&#x201C;The Alps from Schaffhausen&#x201D;&#x005D;</span>.</div>

                            accords well with a trajectory of this writing toward a terminus ad quem among draft of poetry preparing for his father&#x02BC;s

                            proceeds from poems about mountain crossings to poems about <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>, the ongoing intermixing of draft relating to points 
                            in northern Europe suggests that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s drafting was gradually converging with his fair&#x2010;copying in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>.

                            <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, three&#x2010;quarters of the way down the page, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            started the prose essay, <span class="title-essay-JRBRUSSELSPROSE">&#x201C;Brussels&#x201D;</span>, entitling it

                            where it stops in mid&#x2010;sentence, with the word &#x201C;circumnavigating&#x201D; substituted for <span class="del-strikethrough">traversing</span>. At this point, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> stopped to compose a poem, <span class="title-poem-JRJROHSOFTLYBLEW">&#x201C;Oh softly blew the mounting breeze&#x201D; &#x005B;&#x201C;Chiavenna&#x201D;&#x005D;</span>; 
                            and then, at the top of the next recto, 63r, he completed the prose essay, <span class="title-essay-JRBRUSSELSPROSE2_MSVIII">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; &#x005B;part 2&#x005D;</span>, 
                            which he took up in mid&#x2010;sentence, with the phrase &#x201C;perambulating . . . tread on it softly&#x201D;. In the fair copy of this prose passage, 
                            a line of text ends with the break&#x2010;point in the draft of <span class="title-essay-JRBRUSSELSPROSE1_MSVIII">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; &#x005B;part 1&#x005D;</span>, 
                            &#x201C;circumnavigating for&#x201D;&#x2014;with the &#x201C;for&#x201D; jammed against the justified right margin. The next line resumes as in 
                            <span class="title-essay-JRBRUSSELSPROSE2_MSVIII">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; &#x005B;part 2&#x005D;</span>: &#x201C;perambulating.&#x2014;Oh woe to the weather&#x201D;. 
                            One might infer, then, that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> fair&#x2010;copied <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/part_of_brussels_prose1_msviii.php");?>" target="_self">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; &#x005B;part 1&#x005D;</a> in

                            crossed out the last word in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft on 62v (&#x201C;<span class="del-strikethrough">traversing</span>&#x201D;), 
                            since he could not fit that word on the line in the fair copy (hence, the tightly fitted, almost run&#x2010;together &#x201C;circumnavigating, for&#x201D;); 
                            then perhaps stopped fair&#x2010;copying the prose in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>, in order to compose the poem that falls next 
                            in draft; and finally resumed drafting prose with <span class="title-essay-JRBRUSSELSPROSE2_MSVIII">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; &#x005B;part 2&#x005D;</span>, 
                            only changing his mind about the next word (making it &#x201C;perambulating&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;traversing&#x201D;).</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Perhaps close to the time when composing and fair&#x2010;copying converged, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> broke off to plan a continuation

                            made long after <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drafted the original texts, and after he had abandoned the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> 
                            as a project, since the copies are included in a group of texts&#x2014;all transcribed in the same unidentified hand, which worked from the opposite end of the original use of

                            In none of these manuscripts does the numbering give the appearance of having been added at a time later than composition. Overall, the numbering system appears mechanical, reinforcing the suggestion 
                            of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s regular, uncrowded pace of composition in the manuscripts, despite the sometimes helter&#x2010;skelter 
                            of leaping around the map in the topographical sequence of subjects in draft for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Overall, a chronological order of composition is indicated by the sequential line numbering from manuscript to manuscript, despite unexplained gaps 
                            in the numbering, which supports the textual history proposed here for the evolution of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> project. 
                            The numbering advances sequentially from 1&#x2013;173 in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG1">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span>, 
                            to 360&#x2013;429 in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG2">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span>, to 506&#x2013;1484 in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>. 
                            In the two sheets comprising <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG1">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span>, the lines of the five poems are numbered 
                            continuously, 1&#x2013;173, without breaks between the separate poems. In <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG2">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span>, 
                            the line numbering begins following the prose essay, <span class="title-essay-JRCALAISPROSE">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</span>, 
                            starting with the first line of <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span> as line 360, 
                            and running continuously from poem to poem, to line 429. Since the poems in this manuscript, unlike those in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG1">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span>, 
                            could never have been conceived as sequentially ordered in a topographical sense for fair copy, this instance shows that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            did not employ the system in the course of composition to keep track of a topographical ordering of sections. Nonetheless, the numbering may have been useful to him 
                            when transferring draft to fair copy in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">In the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft sequence, the line numbering takes up with line 506, applied to

                            and the numbering carries relentlessly and mechanically forward through the verse draft in <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/ms_viii_apparatus.php#CONTENTS");?>" target="_self">MS VIII: Contents, Section <i>b</i></a>, 
                            albeit with occasional gaps or overlapping numbering. 
                            Where poetry encounters prose on the page, the line numbering halts, and then resumes sequentially following the interruption. 
                            As in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG2">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span>, the line numbering in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> 
                            bears no relation to the topographical sequence, which is jumbled, with poems drafted in no particular geographical order (except for the occasional topographical cluster), 
                            and with some poems such as <span class="title-poem-JRHEIDELBERG">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</span> and <span class="title-poem-JRGENOA">&#x201C;Genoa&#x201D;</span> 
                            divided into parts separated by several pages with no effect on the numbering sequence. Thus, in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> as well, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s numbering the lines of poetry seems mechanical. Doubtless, he needed a line count in order to estimate 
                            the space needed to fair&#x2010;copy lines; however, the system would not have helped him estimate space for prose, and the presence of the numbering in 
                            <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG1">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</span> suggests that he initiated the numbering scheme before he even conceived 
                            the composite&#x2010;genre version represented by the fair copy.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Nonetheless, the line numbering can be used to corroborate other evidence in drawing conclusions about the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>. 
                            For example, the onset of the numbering in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> with line 506 seems strong evidence for treating the poem 
                            <span class="title-poem-JROHARETHERESPIRITS">&#x201C;Oh are there spirits, can there be&#x201D;</span> as a part of the work, especially 
                            since this evidence supports the thematic relevance of the poem. At the opposite end of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> 
                            draft in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, the continuous line numbering ends at line 1484, the final line of the poem 
                            <span class="title-poem-JRVILLAPLINIANA">&#x201C;Villa Pliniana&#x201D;</span>; and on the following recto, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            started line numbering anew with line 1 for the start of <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span></a>. 
                            The latter poem, as argued in <a href="PUBLICATION1834">Publication: <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> (November 1834)</a>, marks his departure from the 
                            <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> per se, to prepare for publication in <span class="title-anthology-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">The line numbering does not, however, supply foolproof evidence that poems comprised within the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>

                            suggesting either that the poem bears a tangential relation to the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, 
                            or that the line numbering system served an additional purpose to counting lines for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, 
                            or that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> sometimes numbered the ruled lines on the page ahead of composing and was merely careless

                     <div class="p">There also seems no way to tell whether the places listed refer to projected individual poems or prose essays or to elaborated composite&#x2010;genre and illustrated sections. 
                            At the time <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> compiled the list, some of the places listed likely were already represented by individual poems 
                            in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> and <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span> draft&#x2014;most 
                            notably numbers 14&#x2013;17, which correspond to the poems, <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span>, 
                            <span class="title-composite-JRVIAMALACOMP">&#x201C;The Via Mala&#x201D;</span>, <span class="title-composite-JRSPLUGENCOMP">&#x201C;Splugen&#x201D;</span>,

                            (see <a href="COMPOSITEILLUSTRATEDTRAVELOGUEDRAFT">Drafting the Composite&#x2010;Genre Travelogue &#x005B;MS VII, VIII, XI&#x005D;</a>). The ticks in the margin 
                            next to these five items in the list doubtless bear some significance; and while we cannot ascertain who was responsible for these marks or precisely what they signified, 
                            we can conjecture that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> made the marks with the intention to highlight the boundaries of a section, 
                            with perhaps <span class="title-composite-JRPASSINGTHEALPSCOMP">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span> serving as the section head. 
                            While this meager authority might justify collecting these five poems as a conjectural corpus, we would be left with the problem that the fair copy 
                            supplies no precedent for an all&#x2010;verse section (although it does include an all&#x2010;prose section, <span class="title-composite-JRAIXLACHAPELLECOMP">&#x201C;Aix la Chapelle&#x201D;</span>); 
                            and we would need to imagine <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composing some prose for the section, not to mention illustrating it with &#x201C;engravings,&#x201D; had he carried on with the project.</div>

                  <div class="p">The evolution of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> project culminated in edited publications of

                            In none of these did the editors make clear the authority for their texts. Overall, however, the successive published versions may be said steadily 
                            to have approached realization of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s intentions for his final version, had he completed such a version himself.

                            not accurately represented, and arguably was misrepresented, by the <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, <span class="date-1850">1850</span>, and <span class="date-1891">1891</span> 
                            published texs. Only the <span class="date-1902">1903</span> edition conveyed an idea of the composite&#x2010;genre version 
                            as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> conceived it, but the edition is incompletely realized, and for many of its choices it relies uncritically on the <span class="date-1891">1891</span> edition.</div>

                            the boy&#x02BC;s precocious abilities that he has &#x201C;sketched in verse or prose, or picture,&#x201D; &#x201C;every scene&#x201D; of the family&#x02BC;s tour

                            <span class="persName-JJR">the proud father</span> at least pretends to misgivings about exposing their prodigy to the public. In the timing of this appeal, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> 
                            was renewing contact with <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> following a lengthy hiatus in the family&#x02BC;s slight acquaintance with the famed Scottish writer, 
                            so the abrupt resumption indicates that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> were weighing the merits 
                            of publication with greater seriousness than they evidently regarded their son&#x02BC;s actual first appearance in print as a poet, with

                            preceded the composition of <span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span>, for, although it may seem logical 
                            that revision of existing text would have predated invention of new, one can imagine as an equally likely scenario that <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>

                            on the strength of his clever imitation of illustrated travel literature in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>. That the two commissions came 
                            close together is suggested, moreover, by the probable timing of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s fair&#x2010;copying of the

                            Since the fair&#x2010;copy texts of the poems for these sections remain largely unchanged from their first instantiation in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG2">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span>,

                            Perhaps he would have excerpted selections in an introduction, following his manner of confining the earliest juvenile verse to the &#x201C;Editor&#x02BC;s Introduction&#x201D;

                            as consistent with the mature author&#x02BC;s mission to elevate &#x201C;the public taste in poetry as well as art&#x201D;; and it was in &#x201C;these poems&#x201D;,

                            but it is evident that the &#x201C;purpose&#x201D; meant, for <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>, attentiveness to scenic experiences of touring, 
                            and not <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s interest in the technology of printed images. That is, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>

                            regularized punctuation and spelling, and he did not scruple to mend lines as he saw fit. (Details are given in the textual glosses attached to transcriptions.)

                            In <span class="date-1882">1882</span>, before he even started writing the autobiography, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s stake 
                            in editing the poems had been prompted by the American publisher, John Wiley &#x0026; Sons, stealing a march on reprinting 
                            the poems first published in the annuals, causing him to raise the alarm to <span class="persName-AW">Alexander Wedderburn</span> (7 February 1882 or 1883,

                            It is interesting to speculate how that perceived theft might have helped to sponsor the idea of writing an autobiography, but once he had told his story in that book

                            of our usual annual tour&#x201D;

                            This work, which was indeed published that spring with <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> among the printed list of subscribers, 
                            is credited by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, doubtless apocryphally, with having prompted the family&#x02BC;s tour spontaneously, 
                            whereas the journey must in fact have long been in planning: 
                            &#x201C;as my mother watched my father&#x02BC;s pleasure and mine in looking at the wonderful places, she said, why should we not go and see some of them in reality? 
                            My father hesitated a little, then with glittering eyes said&#x2014;why not? And there were two or three weeks of entirely rapturous and amazed preparation&#x201D;

                            lithographs cannot solely have prompted the tour as such, the book probably did help imaginatively to orient the family to the north of Europe, 
                            just as <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>

                     <div class="p">The influence of these two publications is exaggerated in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, 
                            but the two books can be viewed as representative not only of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s conceptualization of his family&#x02BC;s 
                            northern and southern destinations, but also of how those destinations were materially embodied in the illustrated travel writing and publication of 
                            the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-artwork-PROUTSKETCHES"><i>Facsimiles</i></span> 
                            provides a pictorial tour through <span class="placeName-BELGIUM">Belgium</span> and <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span> in fifty lithographic prints, 
                            featuring picturesque medieval and Renaissance architectural sites. The book contains no letterpress; the locales depicted are identified only by place names 
                            lettered directly onto the lithographic stone, as part of the image. The lithographs, then a new medium in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>, 
                            would have struck the Ruskins by their dramatically large size (22 by 15 inches) and watercolor&#x2010;like texture. In contrast, 
                            <span class="persName-SP">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> leads the reader on the more traditional 
                            Grand Tour through the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> into the south. The linked series of topographical and narrative poems forms a more conventional work, 
                            less picturesque than historical and classically learned. <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s verse and taste were late&#x2010;eighteenth&#x2010;century in manner, 
                            and his <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> could not compete in popularity with 
                            <span class="persName-GGB">Lord Byron</span>&#x02BC;s fourth part of <span class="title-poem-BYRONPILGRIMAGE"><i>Childe Harold&#x02BC;s Pilgrimage</i></span>, 
                            which is set in <span class="placeName-VENICE">Venice</span>. While not entirely ignored, the work gained popular acclaim only when 
                            <span class="persName-SP">Rogers</span> invested in the graphic enhancements that enabled him to repackage the poem as the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> illustrated edition, 
                            exploiting the up&#x2010;to&#x2010;date technologies of steel engraving and mass production that had sponsored the boom in

                            The edition was innovative also in combining an intaglio process&#x2014;its finely etched, steel&#x2010;engraved vignettes (2&#x2013;3 inches by 3&#x2013;4 inches) that illustrate 
                            <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s poems&#x2014;with the relief printing of the poems on the same page. The exquisite vignettes 
                            (a more typical size for the engraved area of steel&#x2010;engraved book illustration was larger, 7 by 5 inches &#x005B;<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED");?>" target="_self">Hunnisett, <i>Steel&#x2010;Engraved Book Illustration in England</i></a>, 35&#x005D;) 
                            conveyed <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s atmospheric effects on a scale that harmonized with <span class="persName-SP">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s

                            a benignly colorful of peasant culture. For the Ruskins, both the contrasts and complements with <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s imposing lithographic plates detailing busy town squares 
                            surrounding picturesque architectural monuments must have seemed dramatic.</div>

                            underwent a development parallel to that of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s work, originating as a travelogue written solely in verse 
                            and in an eighteenth&#x2010;century manner of topographical poetry, and then being elaborated as an illustrated composite&#x2010;genre travel narrative 
                            typical of the steel&#x2010;engraved landscape <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/annuals_note.php");?>" target="_self">annuals</a> 
                            of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span> (see <a href="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</a>). The Ruskin family 
                            was familiar with <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> in one of its earlier, non&#x2010;illustrated versions, which they owned, 
                            as well as with the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> illustrated version (although, as remarked in <a href="#DATEOFCOMPOSITION">Date of Composition</a>, there is some ambiguity concerning when the family 
                            acquired the illustrated version). Regardless of when this book entered the household, its influence is palpable from the start of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s

While critics have focused too exclusively on <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> 
                            as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s model, at the cost of recognizing his imitations of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-PROUTSKETCHES"><i>Facsimiles</i></span>

                            <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s book frames the foundational layout and conception of the composite&#x2010;genre <span class="title-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>.

                            notable innovation of combining the intaglio effects of the vignette on the same page with the relief type. <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> 
                            probably based his layout on the admired designs by <span class="persName-WBPUBLISHER">William Bulmer</span> (<span class="date-1757-1830">1757&#x2013;1830</span>) 
                            for editions of English poets, published in the <span class="date-1790-1799">1790s</span> by his Shakspeare Press

                            The editions were decorated with wood&#x2010;engraved vignettes by <span class="persName-">Thomas Bewick</span> (<span class="date-1753-1828">1753&#x2013;1828</span>), 
                            set at the heads of title pages of the poems, and producing an elegant page layout, which was made possible by the conformity of the relief wood engraving with the relief type. 
                            That conformity was not possible in the new mass&#x2010;produced <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/annuals_note.php");?>" target="_self">annuals</a>,

                            which was widely remarked in reviews of the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY1830"><i>Italy</i></span>,

                                as compared with the fairy world of brilliant light and haunted shadow suggested by the exquisite intaglio of <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s vignettes.

                            But <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> subtitled his work <i>A Poem</i>, and he dispersed the few prose pieces irregularly, 
                            with at most a pattern of loose association with their immediately surrounding poems, whereas <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> constructed 
                            each of his topographical sections (with one exception) using both verse and prose. Unlike <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not independently title his prose pieces, but subordinated them to the topographical unit, 
                            typically separating prose from poem with a drawing, which serves as a hinge between the two kinds of writing and binds the parts into an associative, 
                            but still coherent unit. At the same time, while complementing the poems, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s prose pieces also contrast 
                            with his rather generalized, picturesque poetic views, by bringing the tone down to earth with first&#x2010;person, anecdotal and comedic commentary 
                            about specific locales.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Thus, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> amplified <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s uniform pattern of text and illustration, which 
                            in the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> <i>Italy</i> consists of a landscape vignette after a drawing by <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> 
                            serving as a header, placed above a poem&#x02BC;s title; and following the poem, a figure vignette after a drawing by <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>, 
                            serving as a tailpiece. (The prose pieces are not illustrated.) While in its present condition, the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy 
                            is missing many drawings (see <a href="#COMPOSITEILLUSTRATEDTRAVELOGUE">The Composite&#x2010;Genre Illustrated Travelogue</a>), 
                            the examples remaining in place indicate that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intended, at the least, to complement each poem with a prose piece, 
                            and to supply each poem and each prose piece with its own headpiece and tailpiece&#x2014;four vignettes in total for each topographical unit. 
                            And while <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> typically honors <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s pattern of using a landscape or cityscape as a headpiece, 
                            and a figure drawing as tailpiece, he varies the pattern somewhat (as does <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>) by occasionally heading a section 
                            with a more anecdotal, narrative vignette.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> carries his principle of amplification in the sister arts to an extreme in the sections on

The earlier composed of the two poems, <span class="title-poem-JRALPSFROMSCHAFFHAUSEN">&#x201C;There is a charmed peace, that aye&#x201D; &#x005B;&#x201C;The Alps from Schaffhausen&#x201D;&#x005D;</span>, 
                                builds up to its cry of discovery, &#x201C;The <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>,&#x2014;Full far away / The long successive ranges lay&#x201D;, 
                                by imaginatively coursing the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>, whereas a later&#x2010;composed fragment, <span class="title-poem-JRSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">&#x201C;Schaffhausen&#x201D;</span>, 
                                can be read as an alternate introduction to the scene, by tracing a stroll to the &#x201C;summit of the hill&#x201D; from whence presumably 
                                the mountains would be sighted, had <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span> continued with the poem. Biographically, the climb up that hill occurred on the same Sabbath evening 
                                with which <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span> opens his description of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> in <span class="title-poem-JRALPSFROMSSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">&#x003E;&#x201C;There is a charmed peace that aye&#x003E;&#x201D; &#x005B;&#x003E;&#x201C;The Alps from Schaffhausen&#x003E;&#x201D;&#x005D;</span>, 
                                but the fragment, <span class="title-poem-JRSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">&#x201C;Schaffhausen&#x201D;</span>, seems the start of a domestic complement 
                                to the sublimity of the earlier&#x2010;composed, longer piece, with its description of the river driving toward the <span class="geogName-">Rhine Falls</span>, 
                                rendered in emphatically pounded dactylic lines, which stand out from the normal, amiable flow of iambic octosyllabic verse.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">As a contrast with these large, amplified units of verse, prose, and picture, comprising contrasting genres, the section <span class="title-composite-JRAIXLACHAPELLECOMP">&#x201C;Aix la Chapelle&#x201D;</span> 
                            in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> consists only of a prose text and a single illustration. The headpiece is an imposing rendering of the city&#x02BC;s cathedral, 
                            drawn in <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s manner. Taking up nearly a full page like <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s other ambitious copy after <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>, 
                            the lithograph&#x2010;like drawing of <span class="title-artwork-JRTHEMEUSELIEGEMSIX">LiÃ¨ge</span>, the large rectangular image of the cathedral is not a vignette, 
                            and was probably meant to imitate the comparatively large dimensions of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s portfolio. Beneath the drawing, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            allowed just enough space for the section heading and a few lines of text, just as place names are lettered directly onto <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s plates. 
                            Even here, however, where <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> pivots away from his grand multi&#x2010;genre and multi&#x2010;media amplifications of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s design, 
                            to exhibit a large&#x2010;scale but unitary plate in the manner of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>, he cannot resist varying the single prose essay by combining in it 
                            both comic and picturesque modes (the latter typically represented by verse in the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>). 
                            First, the narrator riffs on the <span class="date-1748-04-24">Peace of Aix la Chapelle</span> to mock the somnolent &#x201C;peace treaties&#x201D; governing the local postillions, 
                            but then the speaker is rhapsodically taken by the sublimity of the cathedral&#x02BC;s interior in moonlight, described in the manner of <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>. 
                            Finally, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s narrator parodies a guidebook writer&#x02BC;s tour of antiquities inside the cathedral. As in the section, 
                            <span class="title-composite-JREHRENBREITSTEINCOMP">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D;</span>, the condensation of multiple genres is thematically reflected in a geographical 
                            situation that bespeaks confluence. <span class="placeName-AIXLACHAPELLE">Aix la Chapelle</span> lay at the juncture of the <span class="placeName-NETHERLANDS">Netherlands</span>, 
                            <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span>, and the newly founded <span class="placeName-BELGIUM">Belgium</span>, and the city was historically distinctive for its imperial status.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s liveliness of response to the material world of art production and reproduction that guided early Victorian picturesque travel, his achievement 
                            in the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> is overlooked by interpretations that insist on the neurotic constraints of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s early self&#x2010;instruction 
                            in drawing. For example, <span class="persName-PHW">Paul H. Walton</span> sees <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s adoption of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s

                            as one example of the youth&#x02BC;s tendency &#x201C;to revert to pen and ink in more factual studies of picturesque buildings and views&#x201D;, 
                            owing to a misguided direction of &#x201C;his earliest art activity . . . along lines strictly defined by adult standards and ideas of what 
                            was educationally desirable, so that he was not encouraged, nor did he have the time, to draw in a playful way the kinds of figure subjects in which a child 
                            imaginatively expresses and defines a conception of himself within a framework of human relationships&#x201D;. As a contrast with this alleged &#x201C;crippl&#x005B;ing&#x005D;&#x201D; of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s 
                            imagination, which &#x201C;had much to do with the tragedy of his personal life&#x201D;, <span class="persName-PHW">Walton</span> points to &#x201C;the happy, normal family life of a boy&#x201D; 
                            like <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s later sexual nemesis, <span class="persName-JEM">John Everett Millais</span>, whose youthful drawings included the kind of &#x201C;subjects usually preferred by boy artists: 
                            soldiers, animals, machines, caricatures of family and friends&#x201D;. As a consequence, even when a prospect of freedom opened up in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s youthful art teaching, 
                            such as when his first drawing master, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/runciman_charles_note.php");?>" target="_self">Charles Runciman (1798&#x2013;1864)</a> challenged the boy &#x201C;to imitate the free,

                     <div class="p">It is not true, however, that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s writing and drawings neglect subjects appropriate to &#x201C;boy artists&#x201D;; 
                            more importantly, <span class="persName-PHW">Walton</span>&#x02BC;s division of the normative from the creative ignores how spontaneity and invention can be prompted 
                            in surprising ways, and one of these is the young <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s playfulness in manipulating the material culture surrounding a youth of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>.

                            he also amuses himself by manipulating that culture&#x2014;for example, reconceptualizing <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s full&#x2010;page engraving, 
                            <span class="title-artwork-JMWTEHRENBREITSTEINIMAGE"><i>Ehrenbreitstein</i></span>, as a vignette, or shrinking one of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s

                            opening up in northern Europe alongside the well&#x2010;worn path of the Grand Tour to <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>. 
                            Apart from the attraction of <span class="placeName-WATERLOO">Waterloo Field</span>, travel in the <span class="placeName-PASDECALAIS">Pas&#x2010;de&#x2010;Calais</span> and <span class="placeName-FLANDERS">Flanders</span> remained

                            journey, the artist&#x02BC;s early importance to British perceptions of northern Europe is corroborated by the novelty of his representations of towns

                                    the editors of those volumes appear to have paid scant attention to the <span class="title-bibliography_text-JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan</span>

                                    The <span class="title-bibliography_text-JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan</span> is significant, not only as an authority for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s intentions 
                                    for completing the work, but also as a key to revealing the influence of <span class="persName-SR">Samuel Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s poetry on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s design, 
                                    an influence that is strongest&#x2014;at least on the evidence of surviving draft&#x2014;in the representation of Alpine crossings, 
                                    from <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span> into <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>, and from <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> into <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span>.</div>

                                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s later story about his supposed contretemps, when he was introduced as a boy wonder to the famous man of taste, of
                                    &#x201C;congratulating . . . &#x005B;<span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x005D; with enthusiasm on the beauty of the engravings by which his poems were illustrated,&#x201D; 
                                    thus implying that the youth knew &#x201C;more of the vignettes &#x005B;in <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY1830"><i>Italy</i></span>&#x005D; 
                                    than the verses&#x201D; (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE");?>" target="_self">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 34:96). 
                                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did respond insightfully and creatively to the poems, however, as becomes evident by comparing his draft writing for the Italian and
                                    Swiss sections of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> to the positions these pieces would have occupied 
                                    in the <span class="title-bibliography_text-JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan</span>, and then comparing <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s own sequence of poems in 
                                    <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>. These comparisons show that, surprisingly, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> took from <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> 
                                    mainly ideas for representing the experience of mountain crossing, rather than what was surely <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s own primary focus&#x2014;the

                                    meant these titles to refer to composite sections, or to individual pieces, some of which he had already composed, but we can only assume

                                    the extant individual draft pieces that, in their content, most likely correspond to the proposed composite sections include the poem,

                                    a more compelling interpretation emerges by reading the <span class="title-bibliography_text-JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan</span>, 
                                    along with the surviving draft corresponding to it, as a literary design derived from <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>. 
                                    (One consequence, then, is to perceive the long reach of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s influence, via the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, 
                                    on the narrative in the autobiography, rather than spuriously treating the poems as documentary evidence for what <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would write a half&#x2010;century later.)</div>

                                    with borrowings from <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</span>. In <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s poem,

                                    by &#x201C;look&#x005B;ing&#x005D; once on the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> . . . / And think&#x005B;ing&#x005D; on the moment thenceforward for ever&#x201D;&#x2014;the speaker 
                                    goes on to meditate on the <span class="geogName-">Alps</span> as a &#x201C;barrier&#x201D; determining the fate of nations rather than the self, whether of nations struggling to conquer that barrier or seeking its protection. 
                                    For the English during the Napoleonic era and afterward, this theme was resonant with recent threats of invasion. But writing in <span class="date-1818">1818</span> (and looking back to his tour taken 
                                    during the temporary peace of <span class="date-1814">1814</span>), <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> is able to contrast the danger and difficulty of nations struggling in the past against the barrier of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>, 
                                    using historical examples such as <span class="persName-HANNIBAL">Hannibal</span>&#x02BC;s invasion of <span class="placeName-">Rome</span>, with the pleasure of the modern tourist&#x02BC;s ease and security of mountain travel. 
                                    That ease was afforded, ironically, by wartime engineering to overcome the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alpine</span> barrier, bringing conquest. (<span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> entered <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> 
                                    from western <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span>, using the broad carriage road through the <span class="geogName-SIMPLON">Simplon Pass</span>, 
                                    which had been laid by <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span>&#x02BC;s engineers.) In <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span>, 
                                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> elaborates <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s brief historical example of <span class="persName-HANNIBAL">Hannibal</span>&#x02BC;s crossing into a poem&#x2010;length spectacle, 
                                    his imagination likely fired not only by <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s lines but also by <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s vignette for that poem in the 
                                    <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY1830">1830 edition of <i>Italy</i></span>, which depicts <span class="persName-HANNIBAL">Hannibal</span>&#x02BC;s army 
                                    filing with their elephants through the mountains. In his poem, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> makes a corresponding effort at writing the sublime, 
                                    adumbrating the catastrophe for <span class="placeName-ROMEANCIENT">Rome</span> in the menacing turmoil of the surrounding landscape and atmosphere. The poem is to some degree an ekphrasis, 
                                    based on <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s vignette 
                                    (see the contextual glosses for <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span>).</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">In context of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-bibliography_text-JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan</span>, <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span> 
                                    can be viewed structurally either as a pivot between the two clusters&#x2014;that on the first distant sighting of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>, 
                                    and the cluster on crossing the mountains into <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>&#x2014;or the poem can be regarded as the first piece 
                                    in the series relating the physical crossing. It should be borne in mind that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composed the poem earlier than and separately from the other poems 
                                    about mountain crossing. In its original context, <span class="title-manuscript-MSIAG2">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</span>, 
                                    <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span> was situated between the prose essay, 
                                    <span class="title-essay-JRCALAISPROSE">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</span>, and the poem, <span class="title-poem-JRMILANCATHEDRAL">&#x201C;Milan Cathedral&#x201D;</span> 
                                    (see <a href="#COMPOSITETRAVELOGUE">The Composite&#x2010;Genre Travelogue &#x005B;MS IA, <i>g</i>.2&#x005D;</a>). 
                                    Here, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was perhaps imitating <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s structural function of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</span> as a pivotal poem, 
                                    preparing the reader for passing through the &#x201C;barrier&#x201D; of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> between north and south, <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span> and <span class="placeName-MILAN">Milan</span>, by reflecting on history and spectacle&#x2014;<span class="persName-HANNIBAL">Hannibal</span>&#x02BC;s crossing&#x2014;just 
                                    as <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> causes the reader to trace and re&#x2013;trace ground between west and east, by reflecting on both ancient and modern history.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">By selecting only the one historical example of <span class="persName-HANNIBAL">Hannibal</span>&#x02BC;s crossing for elaboration, however, from the several with which <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> crowds <span class="title-poem-">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</span>, 
                                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> demonstrates a tendency to expand and attenuate what <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> presents as layers of memory and history. 
                                    On the one hand, by positioning his <span class="persName-HANNIBAL">Hannibal</span> poem, <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span>, 
                                    as a fulcrum between sections about approaching the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> and sections about crossing the mountains, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> acknowledges <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s procedure of concentrating and multiplying perspectives. 
                                    In <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</span>, the speaker describes multiple viewpoints, 
                                    first recalling his approach to the mountains from below, in western <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span> (<span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> begins <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> in <span class="placeName-LAKEGENEVA">Lake Geneva</span> and environs) 
                                    and then gazing over a wide prospect from above&#x2014;retracing the winding road that he has climbed, and anticipating the path that he will follow to descend 
                                    into <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>. In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s sequence, these stages are drawn out as a succession of real&#x2010;time descriptions, 
                                    with each stage of the passage represented by a separate poem: the sublime terror of the <span class="geogName-VIAMALA">Via Mala</span>; a respite in the pastoral village of <span class="placeName-SPLUGENVILLAGE">SplÃ¼gen</span>; 
                                    the turning point achieved amid the bleak landscape of the summit, with its dire remembrances of fallen travelers; and the breathtaking descent, winding among the precipitous cliffs, viewed first from above and then from below.
                                    In <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> places <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</span>, 
                                    which describes (without naming) the <span class="geogName-SIMPLON">Simplon</span>, following the poem, <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEGREATSTBERNARD">&#x201C;The Great St. Bernard&#x201D;</span> 
                                    (which he did not visit); and between these two poems falls another, <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEDESCENT">&#x201C;The Descent&#x201D;</span>, 
                                    which illogically leads the traveler downward from the <span class="geogName-SIMPLON">Simplon</span> (again without explicitly identifying it) before the traveler arrives at the pass in <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</span>. 
                                    But <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> was less concerned than <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> with tracing the journey linearly; 
                                    rather, he framed multiple and overlapping opportunites to contextualize the journey in both ancient and recent history. Anticipating the catalog of historical struggles 
                                    against the Alpine barrier in <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</span>, the speaker in <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEDESCENT">&#x201C;The Descent&#x201D;</span> 
                                    relays his guide&#x02BC;s tale of personally encountering <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span> himself, marching his army to <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> and victory at <span class="placeName-MARENGO">Marengo</span>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Yet, while <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> makes his sequences linear where <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s are complex, he does learn from <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s ability to discipline his proclivity 
                                    for digression and complexity by imposing neoclassical balance. In <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, 
                                    <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> digresses between <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEDESCENT">&#x201C;The Descent&#x201D;</span> and <span class="title-poem-ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</span> 
                                    to relate two verse narratives, but the stories are balanced topographically and thematically. <span class="title-poem-ROGERSJORASSE">&#x201C;Jorasse&#x201D;</span>, a highland tale about an intrepid <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alpine</span> hunter who delves into a cave, 
                                    is complemented by <span class="title-poem-ROGERSMARGUERITEDETOURS">&#x201C;Marguerite de Tours&#x201D;</span>, a lowland tale about a girl who crosses from <span class="placeName-">Martigny</span>, 
                                    on the Swiss side of the <span class="geogName-STBERNARD">St. Bernard</span>, to the opposite <span class="placeName-VALDAOSTA">vale of Aosta</span> 
                                    in order to attend to her dying father. Symmetrical and complementary arrangement when showcasing variety was characteristic of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s mix of Neoclassicism and Romanticism, 
                                    a principle reflected in the arrangement not only of his verse but also of his art collection in his famed <span class="placeName-STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</span> bachelor&#x02BC;s residence. 
                                    As one of visitors, the art historian <span class="persName-GFW">Gustav Friedrich Waagen</span>, commented in <span class="date-1835">1835</span>, 
                                    &#x201C;one knows not whether more to admire the diversity or the purity of his taste&#x201D; in exhibiting his treasures; &#x201C;&#x005B;p&#x005D;ictures of the most different schools, 
                                    ancient and modern sculptures, Greek vases, alternately attract the eye, and are so arranged, with a judicious regard to their size, in proportion to the place assigned them, 
                                    that every room is richly and picturesquely ornamented, without having the appearance of a magazine, from being over&#x2013;filled, as we often find&#x201D; 
                                    (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#WAAGENWORKSOFART");?>" target="_self">Waagen,<i>Works of Art and Artists in England</i></a>, 2:132&#x2013;33;

                                    Just so, in both the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> and the first publication derived from it, 
                                    <span class="title-poem-JRFRAGMENTS">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> observes <span class="persName-JR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s 
                                    complementary balancing of variety by pairing, for example, the contrasting modes of gothic sublimity in 
                                    <span class="title-poem-JRANDERNACHT">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</span> with domestic beauty in <span class="title-poem-JRSTGOAR">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</span>; 
                                    and in the original version, he completed the design by bridging the two poems with a middle section, <span class="title-composite-JREHRENBREITSTEINCOMP">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D;</span>, 
                                    which develops a trope of confluence (in the joining of two rivers, the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> and the <span class="geogName-MOSELLE">Moselle</span>). 
                                    In another example of arranging variety around a midpoint, he planned for <span class="title-poem-JRTHESUMMIT">&#x201C;The Summit&#x201D;</span> to serve as 
                                    the centerpiece of the cluster about crossing the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>. At the same time, in <span class="title-poem-JRTHESUMMIT">&#x201C;The Summit&#x201D;</span> 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> tries out <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s own way of allowing for variety within a symmetrical frame, 
                                    by digressing into a narrative. If <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> balances his two narrative poems, <span class="title-poem-ROGERSJORASSE">&#x201C;Jorasse&#x201D;</span> 
                                    and <span class="title-poem-ROGERSMARGUERITEDETOURS">&#x201C;Marguerite de Tours&#x201D;</span>, as a complementary pair, highland tale and lowland tale, 
                                    he also digresses and elaborates: both <span class="name--MARGUERITEDETOURS">Marguerite</span> and <span class="name--JORASSE">Jorasse</span> 
                                    cross mountains to maintain fidelity. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> is prompted by the wayside crosses on the summit of <span class="placeName-SPLUGEN">SplÃ¼gen Pass</span> 
                                    to compare Alpine with <span class="geogName-LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</span> tales of fidelity in tragedy. He narrates the story of <span class="persName-CG">Charles Gough</span>,

                                    While <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> adopted the story from <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>&#x02BC;s and <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span>&#x02BC;s poems 
                                    about <span class="persName-CG">Gough</span>&#x02BC;s fate (see the contextual glosses to this poem), 
                                    it was the influence of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> that prompted him to digress into such a story at the midpoint of the poems about mountain crossing.

                                in search of subjects both for exhibition in watercolor or oil and for wider distribution in engraving and lithography. He is practicing the complementary, 
                                ekphrastic role of the letterpress writer, who provides on&#x2010;demand descriptive and historical verse or prose, in a voice that is variously authoritative or facetious, 
                                and that does not necessarily depend for its authority on a personal acquaintance with the place being described. He is exploring style not only as a resource for artistic self&#x2010;expression 
                                but also as a means of differentiation in the artistic market: he notices how stylistic differences accompany the roles

                                and while his invariable model for verse remains the octosyllabic couplets of <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>&#x02BC;s narrative poems, 
                                he at least tries out strategies for ekphrastic and topographical description borrowed from <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> (whose voice for learning and anecdote he cannot match).</div>

                                Respecting <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>, the Ruskins thought of him in his role as the <span class="persName-pen_name-JH">Ettrick Shepherd</span>, who was romantically imagined as having received his call to poetry

                                The Ruskins would have played down <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s colorful and risqu&#x00E9; character in the <span class="title-essay-NOCTESAMBROSIANAE">&#x201C;Noctes Ambrosianae&#x201D;</span>

                                but <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s parents would hardly have considered such a persona as an appropriate model

                     <div class="p"><span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>, in sharp contrast with <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>, was the urbane &#x201C;man of taste,&#x201D; whose townhouse in <span class="placeName-STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</span> 
                                was a showplace of exquisitely curated Regency neoclassicism, and the scene of his famous breakfasts at which <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> acted the part of social arbiter 
                                of the current <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> artistic and literary scene. In his most positive light, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> might have appeared to the Ruskins as a splendid embodiment 
                                of <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s tastes and aspirations. A former associate of <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>, and a habitu&#x00E9; of at least the byways of fame, 
                                <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> had earned a sound reputation for his poem, <span class="title-poem-ROGERSPLEASURES"><i>The Pleasures of Memory</i></span> (<span class="date-1792">1792</span>), 
                                and, more recently, <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>. The latter may have paled in the popular glare of 
                                <span class="title-poem-BYRONPILGRIMAGE"><i>Childe Harold&#x02BC;s Pilgrimage</i></span>, but the poem was respectably and approachably 
                                neoclassical, regular in its versification, and grounded in the tradition of the Grand Tour to <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>. 
                                <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> was also, like <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, a successful businessman, having made his fortune in banking; 
                                and even though he lavished extravagant sums on artists, engravers, and printers in order to satisfy his perfectionism in crafting editions of his poetry, 
                                <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> recouped his huge investment in his illustrated edition of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY1830"><i>Italy</i></span> 
                                and profited handsomely by its unprecedented sales. The unattractive side of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> to the Ruskins would have been his notoriously acid wit and his worldliness at a time when middle&#x2010;class Evangelical earnestness 
                                was turning the tide on Regency profligacy.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">The two writers also differed profoundly in taste. <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> was so committed to his neoclassicism that <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>

                                Yet, while <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> fits the anecdote into what he now regarded as his fatuous beginnings as a poet, his misplaced complements to the illustrator

                                the poetry commissions for <span class="title-anthology-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>&#x2014;were these geological observations. Later in life, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would find it convenient 
                                to stress his keenness of factual observation at the expense of his poetic effusion. Again, however, from the perspective of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>, one can perceive commonalities in these mentorships. 
                                <span class="persName-JCL">Loudon</span>, like <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> and <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>, was a Scot&#x2014;a member of the extended &#x201C;family&#x201D;

                            as compared with the few "fragments" published in 1834 and 1850. To summarize, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> limited his edition to verse,

                            the work as composite in genre, albeit curtailing reproduction of the drawings. Both editions, however, sought to complete the work beyond the version in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>, 
                            which Ruskin abandoned in the middle of fair-copying the section on "Heidelberg". Cook and Wedderburn's reconstruction relied heavily on Collingwood's for the conjectural ordering 
                            of the poems and essays that Ruskin left in draft, although the 1903 edition not only rejoined the poems that Collingwood had edited with their complementary prose essays, 
                            but also rescued poems and essays about places along the tour that Collingwood had neglected altogether.</div>

                            to some degree of integrity in order to justify publishing the fragmentary work at all, given the conditions placed on his edition (probably by Ruskin himself, but Collingwood does not identify the source) 
                            of omitting "poems and passages as were either without general interest, or incomplete and inadequately representative of the author's attainments and style 
                            at the time" of composition. In <span class="title-book-"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, the author had rejected 
                            the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> as an &#x201C;unfinished folly&#x201D;, 
                            which "none but friends" should ever see. Collingwood interpreted this embargo as referring, "not to the literary quality of the verse"--the first condition 
                            for inclusion in an edition of the poetry--"but to the miscalculation and miscarriage of an ambitious project", thus stigmatizing the work on the grounds 
                            of the second condition. In defense, Collingwood pleaded for reconstructing the work from the &#x201C;rough copies&#x201D; of poems, 
                            which he was &#x201C;pretty certain . . . &#x005B;<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x005D; was not aware of&#x201D; lying &#x201C;at the back of his book&#x2010;shelves&#x201D;

                            story into an account of a Continental tour. On the same principle of treating the "Account" as a diary rather than as a literary construction, 
                            he misplaced <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span>, relegating it to the end of the sequence--between 
                            the poems about Italy and those about the finale of the tour, Chamounix in Switzerland--rather 
                            than where Ruskin's <span class="title-bibliography_text-JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan for Continuation of the Account</span> explicitly 
                            situates the poem, as a preface to the series about crossing the Alps at Splugen. Collingwood's logic is clear enough: <span class="persName-HANNIBAL">Hannibal</span> 
                            descended on Italy through the western Alpine approach, the <span class="geogName-SIMPLON">Simplon</span>, not the northern; however, such geographical and historical literalism misses the point of Ruskin's engagement 
                            with writers and artists in the "Account." Arguably, in situating <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</span> as an introduction 
                            to Chamounix, Collingwood fulfilled Ruskin's idea, apparent in the Plan, to complement the series about crossing the Alps from the north with a reverse poetic series 
                            describing the crossing from the east in Italy:</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">Given Collingwood's indifference to the Plan, however, he evidence suggests that his approximation of Ruskins' intention was a happy accident.</div>
