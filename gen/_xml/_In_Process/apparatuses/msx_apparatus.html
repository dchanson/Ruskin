                        According to <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs original description, <span class="title-manuscript-MSX">MS X</span> was a  cover  containing a number of miscellaneous items, from which, by the time the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> was undertaken, <span class="title-manuscript-RFT48">the diary of <span class="date-1830">1830</span></span>as well as  other papers, not in verse  had been separated (see MSS XA and XB). The remaining contents of the original  cover,  along with a few additions, were  bound up in a volume,  which retained the designation <span class="title-manuscript-MS">MS X</span>. This was item III of lot 27 in <span class="title-catalogue-SOTHEBYCAT1931">Sotheby Cat. <span class="date-1931">1931</span></span> (p. 6), described as <span class="title-poem-JRPOETICALTOUR1835">The Poetical Tour of 1835</span>, Letter to his Father in verse, <span class="date-1836-03-31">31 March, 1836</span>, and much later in date <span class="title-poem-JRPEACESONG">The Peace Song</span> and the <span class="title-poem-JRZODIACSONG">The Zodiac Song</span>, and other pieces.  <span class="title-manuscript-MSX">MS X</span> then came into <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>ʼs possession and is described in his <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCAT">Cat</span>. as  one volume, red cloth,  no doubt the red buckram used for other <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscript bindings of this period. Like <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>, however, by the time <span class="title-manuscript-MSX">MS X</span> was turned over to Yale, it had been unbound and its contents separated—whether before <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>ʼs fire, or after (and owing to) the damage. The separate items are now cataloged at Yale under their individual titles, many of them enclosed in folders inside the box <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin, John</span>, <span class="date-1819-1900">1819–1900</span> / Miscellaneous Manuscripts (see also <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>,  Description ).

                    Content
                    a)  <span class="title-poem-JRPOESIE">To Poesie</span>  (no. 109) is listed first in <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCAT"><span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, Cat</span>. (item 83.A), and presumably appeared first in the original binding, although according to <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span> (2:534) this item either was added later to <span class="title-manuscript-MSX">MS X</span> as described by <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> or was omitted from that earlier description. Its place in front of the contents may account for its severe fire damage, much of the upper right corner being lost of the 10.3 × 18.8‐cm sheet. (Similarly, the upper right corners of b, below, which probably lay immediately beneath a, were sacrificed.) For preservation, the sheet is encased in rice paper, and enclosed in a separte folder in  Miscellaneous Manuscripts. 
                        Both <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCAT">Cat</span>. and <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span> are tentative in identifying the hand of this copy, but the hand is unquestionably <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs. In a penciled note at the end of the poem, she apologizes  I am sorry this is no better writte[n b]ut my pen was bad & I coul[d] not make it better. 
                        b) <span class="title-poem-JRTOURFRANCE1835">Journal of a Tour through <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span> to <span class="placeName-CHAMONIX">Chamouni</span></span> (no. 203), according to <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span> (2:534), was contained in  two paper books,  one of 26 pages for <span class="title-poem-JRTOURFRANCE1835">Canto I</span>, and the second of 10 pages  as far as carried  for <span class="title-poem-JRTOURFRANCE1835">Canto II</span>. <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCAT">Cat</span>. (item 83.B) summarizes  36 pp., 4to.  Despite the severe charring, the manuscript is preserved complete, although the  books  are cut into individual leaves, which are encased in rice paper.  <span class="title-poem-JRTOURFRANCE1835">Canto 1st</span>  (the poem is untitled) is written on thirteen 15.5 × 19‐cm sheets; the presumptive second <span class="title-poem-JRTOURFRANCE1835">canto</span> (no such designation is supplied, only the stanzas are numbered) is written on five 22.5 × 18‐cm sheets.
                        In both  books,  the stanzas run continuously recto to verso, leaf by leaf. In <span class="title-poem-JRTOURFRANCE1835">canto two</span>, two successive stanzas are numbered  24,  the editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> silently correcting the second to  25  and adjusting the successive numbering accordingly. The fragmentary twenty‐ninth and final stanza (thirtieth, in the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>) is not incomplete owing to missing manuscript, since it stops in the middle of a verso.
                        With its very few corrections, the manuscript appears to be fair or semifinal copy (although one must never underestimate <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs facile ability to produce uncorrected draft). If fair copy, the manuscript, by comparison with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs other travelogues, is no  copperplate  fair copy like the  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span>, much less an elaborately illustrated production like the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</span> in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>. Perhaps <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was becoming less interested in bookmaking as an aspect of his poetry.
                        c) Both descriptions (<span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCAT"><span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, Cat</span>., item 83.C, and <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:534) list a versified letter from abroad to <span class="persName-RFALL">Richard Fall</span>, <span class="date-1835-06-14-1835-09-02">14 June—2 September 1835</span> (no. 204), which is now kept inside a folder in a box at Yale,  <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin, John</span>, <span class="date-1819-1900">1819–1900</span> / Letters: F‐H. 
                        The description in <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span> specifies double columns on  5 large pages,  but <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCAT"><span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, Cat</span>. cites  10 pp.  On the folder containing the manuscript (resembling the other folders for items of the <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> donation), as in <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>,  5 p.  is notated. <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCAT">Cat</span>. gives the erroneous description, since the manuscript presently consists of three sheets, 20.5 × 25 cm, two of them written in double columns on both sides, and the third written in double columns on one side. Nothing is missing, since these sheets constitute the entirety of the poem as published in <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:429–38—including the  ms.  postscript, dropped into a note on p. 438.
                        The charred sheets are encased in rice paper. The hand appears to be <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs.
                        d) Both <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCAT"><span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, Cat</span>. (item 83.D) and <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span> (2:534) list  Conversation supposed to be held between Mr R. Mrs R. Miss R. & Master R. on <span class="date-1836-01-01">New‐years morning 1836</span>  (no. 215). Both descriptions count six pages— 6 pp., 4to,  according to <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>—which correspond to the three extant 25 × 20‐cm sheets, encased in plastic and enclosed in a separate folder in the box  Miscellaneous Manuscripts.  Fire damage was severe to the right edges, which show a curious vertical streak, as if the sheets had been folded along that crease; however, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs writing carries across the crease.
                        e) Both <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCAT"><span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, Cat</span>. (item 83.E) and <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span> (2:534) list a <a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1836-03-31_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">rhymed letter</span></a> to <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, <span class="date-1836-03-31">31 March 1836</span> (no. 230), which is now kept inside a folder in a box at Yale,  <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin, John</span>, <span class="date-1819-1900">1819–1900</span> / Letters: N‐Z.  The 20.5 × 25‐cm folded sheet, written in verse on three sides, with the address and a prose paragraph on the fourth side, corresponds to <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>ʼs  3 pp., 4to, and address.  Charred and encased in rice paper. The most thorough transcription of the letter is in <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 358–64, which also provides a full description of the letter.
                        This is the only item from <span class="title-manuscript-MSX">MS X</span> that is specifically identified among <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>ʼs donations in YULG (17, no. 3 [<span class="date-1943-01">January 1943</span>]: 59). The remainder may have been included among the  31 sheets of poems  also listed in that acknowledgment, or they may have been comprised in the  other Ruskiniana  acknowledged later in YULG (19, no. 2 [<span class="date-1944-10">October 1944</span>]: 35). See <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>,  Description. 
                        f) Both descriptions (<span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCAT"><span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, Cat</span>., item 83.F, and <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:534) identify a partial copy (lines 1–185 only) of  <span class="title-poem-JREXILESTHELENA">The Exile of St. Helena</span>  (no. 256) in an unidentified hand— in the hand of a secretary,  the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> adds, in its list of <span class="title-poem-JREXILESTHELENA">Exile</span>  manuscripts, of which Yaleʼs is  b  (<span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:45 n. 2). The hand, I believe, is <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs.
                        The manuscript is untitled, except for the epigraph drawn from II Samuel (the second epigraph of the printed version, from <span class="persName-AEG">Aeschylus</span>, is not present; see <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:45). The manuscript consists of three 18 × 23‐cm sheets, written on both sides, plus one shorter 18 × 15‐cm sheet, written on one side, and torn just below line 185; hence, the torn page represents the state of the manuscript since it was first described as totaling 185 lines, and nothing was lost to fire damage except for the right edges, which are severely charred. The leaves are encased in plastic and enclosed in a folder in the box  Miscellaneous Manuscripts.  
                    g) Both descriptions (<span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCAT">Cat.</span>, item 83.G, and <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:534) include the <span class="title-poem-JRPEACESONG">Peace Song</span>,  and the <span class="title-poem-JRZODIACSONG">Zodiac Song</span>,  the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> explaining that these poems, like a above, were added to <span class="title-manuscript-MSX">MS X</span> when first bound and were not enclosed in the  cover  described by <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>.
                        The charred manuscripts of the two poems are encased in rice paper and kept in separate folders in the box  Miscellaneous Manuscripts.  <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span> (2:245 n.) describes a  loose sheet  for each, and <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCAT"><span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, Cat</span>.  2 pp., 4to  for both. Specifically, <span class="title-poem-JRPEACESONG">The Peace Song</span>  is 20 × 25 cm and watermarked <span class="date-1863">1863</span>, and  <span class="title-poem-JRZODIACSONG">The Zodiac Song</span>  is  18 × 25 cm (no watermark). Perhaps the two manuscripts were intended as a pair, since the one is entitled and numbered  1. <span class="title-poem-JRPEACESONG">The Peace Song</span>,  and the other  2. <span class="title-poem-JRZODIACSONG">The Zodiac Song</span>. 
                    The first printing of <span class="title-poem-JRZODIACSONG">The Zodiac Song</span>  (<span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span> 2:247) follows this manuscript exactly and is evidently taken from it, while the printing of <span class="title-poem-JRPEACESONG">The Peace Song</span> in the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> (there entitled  <span class="title-poem-JRAWAKE">Awake, Awake</span> ) is taken from another source and lists this manuscript as a variant. See also <span class="persName-VAB">Van Akin Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-WINNINGTONLETTERS">The Winnington Letters</span> (<span class="placeName-CAMBRIDGE">Cambridge</span>, <span class="placeName-MASSACHUSETTS">Mass</span>.: Harvard University Press, Belknap Press, <span class="date-1969">1969</span>), 251, 253 n. 4.
