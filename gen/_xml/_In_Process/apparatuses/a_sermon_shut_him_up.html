                        After the first reference on <span class="date-1829-01-19">January 19</span>, which may or may not correspond to  <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> next reports on Saturday, <span class="date-1829-02-21">21 February 1829</span>, 
                        that he was “only at the 1st head of last Sundays sermon”. On the next day, “<span class="persName-EA">Doctor Andrews</span> preached such a delightful sermon . . . 
                        <span class="persName-MBR">Mary</span> and I thought that we remembered a great deal but when we came to write it down we found that we did not remember so much as we thought”. 
                        On <span class="date-1829-03-04">4 March 1829</span>, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> refers to Ruskin writing “a novel & a Sermon both as far as they have gone very tolerable I assure you”

                  <div class="p">In apparently the first reference to noting down sermons he heard in chapel, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrote on <span class="date-1829-01-19">19 January 1829</span> to his father about “a beautiful Sermon” by <span class="persName-EA">Dr. Andrews</span>, 
                        which he and his cousin, <span class="persName-MBR">Mary Richardson</span>, “are putting . . . down as well as we can for you to look at when you come home” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, Ed. Ruskin Family Letters</a>, 173). 
                        That the sermon abstract that they put down refers to one of fragments in <span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span> is supported by the draft of a letter to <span class="persName-MONROMRS">Mrs. Monro</span>, 
                        also copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span>, which mentions that “of late I began to attend to [<span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>’s] sermons and write them in a book at home”. 
                        The “book” may refer to this handmade pamphlet.
                        (this letter and the <span class="date-1829-01-19">January 19</span> letter to his father also correspond in mentioning an identical incident of the children meeting <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> in the street).
