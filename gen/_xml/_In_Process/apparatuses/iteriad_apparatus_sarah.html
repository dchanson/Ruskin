                        quite copied in, fairly dismissed,” as he reports in a <a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1832-01-14_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-jr_to_jjr_1832-01-14">letter of <span class="date-1832-01-14">14 January 1832</span></span></a>, whereupon he “was cutting capers all the remainder of the evening” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 259). 
                        The celebration, along with the exacting record of the dates of composition, likely reflect <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>’s self‐consciousness about the scale of the work.</div>

                  <div class="p">The surviving physical evidence accords with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>’s inscription in <span class="title-manuscript-MSCVII">MS VII</span> that he started composition on <span class="date-1830-11-28">28 November 1830</span>. As <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span> remarks in his edition of the poem 
                        (, 23), <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> began composition with what became book 3, 
                        the 410‐line “Ascent of <span class="geogName-SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</span>,” which he fair‐copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> and there dated <span class="date-1830-12-26">26 December 1830</span>. 
                        Another early dateable reference to “The Ascent of <span class="geogName-SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</span>” occurs in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span> about late <span class="date-1830-12">December 1830</span>. 
                        The mention is found in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>’s handmade index to <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span> and presumably refers to the poemʼs draft in that notebook, 
                        but the draft text is lost since the first half of the notebook was torn away (see <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>: Description; and for dating of index entries, Contents and Discusssion).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drafted most of the poem in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>, a notebook devoted exclusively to rough draft and no fair copy, 
                        with a small part of book 4 composed in the other major rough‐draft notebook, <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>. 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>’s index to <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span> gives the identical page number for both the entry “<span class="geogName-SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</span>” and the entry “<span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>,” 
                        suggesting that he may have conceived of “<span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>” only after completing “<span class="geogName-SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</span>” and as an expansion of the shorter poem. 
                        His index also reveals that this draft followed a piece called “Revolution,” now lost.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">The composition can be traced with precision as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> gleefully reports to his father on the number of lines he has composed, 
                        toting up the farthings he will earn as payment, as <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> had agreed: 
                        “as fast as I load you with mountain after mountain heaped gigantic I shall lighten you of your money  Hurra  Forty lines per day regularly as the sun goes down”

                        By <span class="date-1831-02-28">28 February 1831</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>’s mother says “he has already composed six hundred and thirty two lines not including the ascent of <span class="geogName-SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</span> which he has finished

Since the draft of book 1 in <span class="title-manuscript-">MS VI</span> contains 518 lines, the same as the fair copy, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>’s count indicates that, by <span class="date-1831-02-28">28 February</span>, <span class="persName-JR">John</span> must have reached 
                        line 114 of book 2. (<span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> remarks a discrepancy between <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>’s count of the “Ascent” and book 3 of “<span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>,” 
                        which he says contains 410 lines in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span> [<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 226 n. 5].

                  <div class="p">By <span class="date-1831-03-06">6 March</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> says he is “in the fourth hundred of the second book cantering away to <span class="placeName-BARROWDALE">Barrowdale</span> [i.e., <span class="placeName-BORROWDALE">Borrowdale</span>] and <span class="geogName-BOWDERSTONE">Bowder stone</span> and <span class="geogName-BUTTERMERE">Buttermere</span>” (<a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1831-03-06_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter of <span class="date-1831-03-06"> 6 March 1831</span></span></a> [<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 233]). 
                        If he had in fact reached line 114 by the end of <span class="date-1831-02-28">28 February</span>, 400 lines of book 2 by <span class="date-1831-03-06">6 March</span> would put him about 40–50 lines ahead of his scheduled 40 lines per day 
                        (or, if when writing on <span class="date-1831-02-28">28 February</span>, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> had not counted that day’s production, he is precisely on schedule). 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>’s line‐count of <span class="date-1831-03-06">6 March</span> corresponds to draft that starts the extant portion of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>—namely, pp. 58–74, <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>, which begins with line 176, book 1, 
                        and carries straight through to precisely line 400 of book 2 (see also no. 109 <a href="/apparatuses/poesie_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRPOESIE">“To Poesie”</span></a>, and part 1, <a href="/apparatuses/msvi_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span></a>). In this draft, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> supplied marginal line numbers 
                        with every fifth line, and these lines correspond exactly to the numbered lines in <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span>’s edition 
                        (based on <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>’s transcript of the fair copies <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MSS V</span>, <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">VII</span>). 
                        Thus, with effortless facility, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drafted his couplets in the form and order they would appear in fair copy, 
                        with little appreciable revision, except for occasional changes in wording.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">After <span class="date-1831-03-06">6 March</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>’s “cantering” through draft is slowed to a halting walk. The draft in <span class="title-manuscript-">MS VI</span> (pp. 58–74) carried through line 400, book 2, 
                        by about <span class="date-1831-03-06">6 March</span>, is followed immediately (pp. 75–76) by <a href="/apparatuses/poesie_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRPOESIE">“To Poesie”</span></a> and <a href="/apparatuses/to_the_wind_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTOTHEWIND">“To the Wind”</span></a>, known to have been composed <span class="date-1831-03-11-1831-03-12">11–12 March 1831</span>. 
                        These poems are succeeded (p. 76) by lines 401–26, book 2, entitled by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> “Continuation of second book of the <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>.” 
                        This passage, therefore, was composed after <span class="date-1831-03-12">12 March</span>. The upper limiting date of the passage is <span class="date-1831-03-21">21 March</span>, since it is followed (pp. 77–78) by <a href="/apparatuses/want_of_a_subject_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRWANTOFASUBJECT">“On the Want of a Subject”</span></a>, 
                        to which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> refers in a <a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1831-03-21_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-jr_to_jjr_1831-03-21">letter of that date</span></a>, and by <a href="/apparatuses/the_feminine_gender_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHEFEMININEGENDER">“Oh dear, the Feminine Gender”</span></a>, which is dated “<span class="date-1831-03-21">21st March 1831</span>” in the manuscript (pp. 78, 81).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Book 2 is resumed (and headed <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">“Iteriad”</span>) with lines 427–538 on pp. 82–84 of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>; three‐quarters of the way through this passage, following line 504 (p. 83),

                        Thus, the month since the previous installment (lines 401–26, composed between <span class="date-1831-03-12-1831-03-21">12 and 21 March</span>) had been devoted only to lines 427–504,

                        were probably finished before the end of the month, since these lines precede draft (pp. 84–85) of <a href="/apparatuses/day_of_joy_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRDAYOFJOY">“Day of Joy”</span></a>, a birthday ode for <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>,

                        Since at least one of these missing folios, as can be inferred from the index to <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>, probably contained draft of <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">“Iteriad”</span> 
                        (see <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>, “Description”), at least some of those lines may have belonged to the subsequent portion of book 2 as fair‐copied—lines 539–658, 
                        which are nowhere else extant in draft. (Not all of this passage is likely to have fit on one missing folio, however, 
                        since only about 45 lines per page is typical for “<span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>” in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>. Of course, this draft passage could have been expanded in some other draft manuscript, now lost, 
                        prior to fair‐copying.) These missing draft lines would have been composed, therefore, either just before <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs <span class="date-1831-05-10">10 May</span> birthday 
                        or sometime after that celebration. If composed after <span class="date-1831-05-10">May 10</span>, the family may by that time have been embarked on their <span class="date-1831-05-01-1831-06-30">May–June journey of 1831</span> 
                        to the south and west of <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span> and <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span>. The lines could even have been delayed until the Ruskins returned from the holiday.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">The concluding lines of book 2, 659–94 occur earlier in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>, raising the possibility that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrote them out of sequence; 
                        they are not numbered by <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span>, possibly because he had not yet composed the lines leading up to them. 
                        However, judging by their appearance in draft, I suspect the concluding lines were in fact composed in sequence 
                        but squeezed into available blank spaces remaining in the earlier section of the manuscript. The first such group of concluding lines (lines 659–67) 
                        is entitled by <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span> “Conclusion of Book 2 <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>” and fills a brief space between <a href="/apparatuses/the_doctors_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHEDOCTORS">“The Doctors”</span></a> and <a href="/apparatuses/shakespeares_grave_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRSHAKESPEARESGRAVE">“Shakespeareʼs Grave”</span></a> on p. 79; 
                        it is written in an ink darker than the surrounding poems. The next passage, lines 668–83, falls at the end of p. 80, following the first five‐line fragment of <a href="/apparatuses/life_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRLIFE">“Life”</span></a>. 
                        The final lines, 684–94, are written (again in the darker ink) along the very bottoms of pp. 81, 82, and 83, 
                        beneath a heavy rule drawn across the lower margins of those pages. Were these concluding passages to be dated strictly by their sequential position, 
                        they would have been composed about <span class="date-1831-03-21-1831-04-30">21 March into April</span>; more likely, they were composed after <span class="date-1831-05">mid‐May</span>, at the earliest.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Book 3 having already been composed, <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span> moved from book 2 to book 4. The two missing folios (pp. 86–89), which probably held draft of 2:539–658 
                        or a portion of those lines, may also have held 4:1–26, or some portion of that opening. It is just as likely, however, that book 4 was begun on some other manuscript, 
                        now lost. The first extant draft of book 4, labeled by <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span> “<span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span> Book 4th,” begins in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span> with line 27 and goes through 68, 
                        according to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>’s own line numbering. This passage begins on p. 88 (according to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>’s revised numbering system for <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>; see <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>, “Description”). 
                        Interrupted by the revision of <a href="/apparatuses/death_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRDEATH">“Death”</span></a>, another segment (labeled “<span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span> Book 4th”) takes up lines 69–94 (p. 89). According to <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span> (ed., <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>, p. 23), 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would have started on book 4 in <span class="date-1831-07">July</span>, following the <span class="date-1831-05-01-1831-06-30">May–June</span> Welsh tour. It cannot be ascertained definitely whether this draft was begun during or following the tour; 
                        however, <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span> is probably correct, since the first extant lines of book 4 (lines 27–68) follow <a href="/apparatuses/melancholy_wont_away_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRMELANCHOLYWONTAWAY">“Melancholy wont away”</span></a> and <a href="/apparatuses/creation_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRCREATION">“Creation”</span></a>, 
                        which can be assigned tentatively to <span class="date-1831-08-01-1831-08-14">early August</span>.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Following 4:94 at the bottom of p. 89, another folio has been removed; but a remaining torn stub shows <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>’s marginal line number 95, 
                        revealing that the draft continued onto that missing page (which also held the lost <span class="title-poem-JRDEARTEPOETICA">“De Arte Poetica”</span>). Hereafter, the composition of book 4 
                        in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span> becomes complex. Having torn away the folio with line 95, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> numbered the next extant folio in proper sequence, i.e., p. 90. 
                        The missing folio may have contained only five lines of book 4, lines 95–100, since lines 101–261 appear continuously on pp. 92–96 
                        (or the missing folio may have contained the five lines plus some discarded version of lines 101ff.). The segment 101–261 is interrupted on p. 96 by <a href="/apparatuses/bed_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRBED">“Bed”</span></a>, 
                        and followed by the single line 262 at the top of the next page (p. 97). After another interruption by <a href="/apparatuses/eternal_hills_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRETERNALHILLS">“The Eternal Hills”</span></a> and <a href="/apparatuses/fun_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRFUN">“Fun”</span></a> (p. 97), lines 263ff. start at the top of p. 98 
                        (headed “<span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>”). For the first time, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>’s line numbering becomes faulty, since what should be (and eventually did become) line 263 is called in draft line 248; 
                        and this continues until what would become line 296 (here, 281). A simple explanation to this discrepancy can be found by looking back two pages to the bottom of p. 95, 
                        which ends with line 246—lines 247–61 being continued at the top of the next page, p. 96, before the draft of <a href="/apparatuses/bed_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRBED">“Bed”</span></a> (no. 133). 
                        When numbering the lines, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> must have overlooked the lines 247–61 at the top of p. 96, and counted from line 246 at the bottom of p. 95, to the single line at the top of p. 97, 
                        and thus to the miscounted line “248” at the top of p. 98. (Another possibility is that lines 247–61 were inserted later, but the single line at the top of p. 97 could not have been composed 
                        without those lines first being in existence, since it rhymes with line 261.) Later, when he reaches line 585 of the book 4 draft (p. 103, line 592 as presently numbered), 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> abruptly corrects this number to 600, very likely accounting for the dropped fifteen lines 247–61. He may have discovered the error while fair‐copying; 
                        if so, the correction tells us that fair‐copying had begun, and was keeping good pace with the composition—lagging only about 300 lines behind.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Note that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>’s corrected numbering still does not correspond with the present, fair‐copy numbering; 
                        the difference is probably to be accounted for by an extra eight lines in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>—falling at points roughly between lines 320 and 350 of book 4 in the fair‐copy numbering—that 
                        are deleted in pencil. When these lines were omitted in fair‐copying, the draft numbering would have come back into sync with the fair copy numbering. 
                        Since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>’s numbering in draft was not further corrected by the end of the poem—which ends at line 704, instead of 696 as presently numbered—his fair‐copying, 
                        if indeed started by now, must have lapsed during the composition of the second half of book 4.)</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">In the misnumbered passage on p. 98, several lines (i.e., those called here 262–69 and 272–81; and, in fair copy, 277–84 and 287–96) are cited only by their first words, 
                        no doubt a shorthand for the for the full lines, elsewhere. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> must now be drafting “<span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>” in another manuscript, as well as in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>. 
                        Indeed, after line 281 (i.e., line 296 in fair copy), <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> directs himself to pick up “From line 281 to line 305 in new Manuscript.” 
                        These lines in the “new Manuscript” would have been 4:297–320, according to fair‐copy numbering, and these lines are in fact to be found early in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, p. 3. 
                        <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, then, according to the approximate pace of “<span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>,” was first put to use in about <span class="date-1831-09">September</span>, and this estimate accords with other evidence dating that manuscript 
                        (see <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>). Finally, rounding out p. 98 in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>, what would become 4:321–26 in fair copy (called lines 306–13 here) is drafted at the bottom of the page, 
                        following the directive to the “new Manuscript.”</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">The next two pages in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span> (99–100r) continue the draft of 4:327–82 (here called 314–75) up to a note in the middle of 100r, “FROM LINE 375 TO LINE 401 AT PAGE NINETY SIX”; 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> is referring to a passage entitled “Coming down upon Ambleside,” which would become 4:383–408 in fair copy, and which is drafted earlier in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>, 
                        following <a href="/apparatuses/with_those_it_does_not_signify_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRWITHTHOSEITDOESNOTSIGNIFY">“With those it does not signify”</span></a> (pp. 90–91). “Coming down upon Ambleside” may in fact have been drafted earlier, out of sequence: 
                        the passage has no marginal line numbers; and there appears no reason why, otherwise, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would have stopped midway on a page (100r), drafted a piece on pp. 90–91, and then returned to p. 100r. 
                        As an earlier fragment, “Coming down upon Ambleside” might have been composed soon after 4:95–100 and <span class="title-poem-JRDEARTEPOETICA">“De Arte Poetica”</span>, which once appeared on a preceding folio, now missing. 
                        Note also that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> is still using his page numbering prior to the mutilation of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span> (i.e., “PAGE NINETY SIX” is now his p. 90).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Returning to 100r, what we now know as 4:409ff. (402ff. here) resumes, and book 4 is composed to the end (lines 409–696; here numbered as lines 402–704; pp. 100r–105). 
                        But <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrote an additional passage entitled “Conclusion of <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>,” which he did not fair‐copy. This is on p. 90, between <a href="/apparatuses/with_those_it_does_not_signify_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRWITHTHOSEITDOESNOTSIGNIFY">“With those it does not signify”</span></a> and “Coming down upon Ambleside.” 
                        It cannot be ascertained whether this “Conclusion” was penned earlier, at the same time as the “Ambleside” passage, or whether it was squeezed into this space after book 4 was completed. 
                        This conclusion reads as follows (edited version first published in <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:315 n. 3):
                        Farewell to each mountain and torrent and river
                        Farewell but it is not a farewell for ever
                        Oh no I will see the [sic] again oh <span class="geogName-SCAFELL">Scawfell</span>
                        Though now I may bid thee a mournful farewell
                        Yes <span class="geogName-WINDERMERE">Windermere</span> Yes I must travel from thee
                        From thy bosom thy beautiful bosom I flee
                        But yet thou hast graven thyself on my mind
                        And hast left the impression so deeply behind
                        That time has no power to destroy or erase
                        Nor one line of that picture atall [sic] to efface</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">The authorʼs “Notes” are drafted on pp. 107–8 of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>. They must have been started after the poem was finished, 
                        since they commence on the first recto to follow the end of book 4, and it seems unlikely that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> could have predicted that his draft would end just here. 
                        The notes refer only to book 1, and they are scored through. Since no notes at all are fair‐copied in <span class="title-manuscript-">MS VII</span>, 
                        this embellishment of the project was obviously abandoned. Indeed, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>’s <span class="title-letter-jr_to_jjr_1832_01-14"><span class="date-1832-01-14">14 January 1832</span> letter</span>, 
                        in which he is “cutting capers” for having finished fair‐copying the poem, 
                        mentions that “I have yet the notes to write” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 259). This identifies the notes as having been composed sometime after <span class="date-1832-01-14">January 14, 1832</span>, 
                        but a considerable time must have elapsed between the drafting of the poem’s final lines and the composition of the notes. 
                        If <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was at about line 320 in <span class="date-1831-09">September 1831</span> (i.e., the passage in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>), surely he did not spend nearly four months composing the remaining 370 lines of book 4. 
                        The intervening time would have been devoted to fair‐copying, although, as suggested earlier, fair‐copying may have been keeping fair pace with composition, 
                        lagging only three or four hundred lines behind.</div>
