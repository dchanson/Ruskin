                     (nos. 47, 28, 48–51, 38, 52–55, 39). 
                        Throughout the group, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> distributed “<span class="date-1829-03-09">March 9th 1829</span>,” “<span class="date-1829-03-09">March 1829</span>,” or just “<span class="date-1829-03-09">9th 1829</span>.”
                        This flurry of fair‐copying must have been instigated by <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs complaint to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> on <span class="date-1829-03-04">March 4</span>:
                        “If you think of writing <span class="persName-JR">John</span> would you impress on him the propriety of not beginning too eagerly and becoming careless towards the end of his works as he calls them  I think in a letter from you it would have great weight”. On <span class="date-1829-03-10">March 10</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> complied with the remark to <span class="persName-JR">John</span>, “You have been at your Works with great Spirit & they commence so well that the end rather disappoints that is if they get to an end” (<a href="/apparatuses/mr_to_jjr_1829-03-04_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, <span class="date-1829-03-04">4 March 1829</span></span></a>; <a href="/apparatuses/jjr_to_jr_1829-03-10_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter to John Ruskin, <span class="date-1829-03-10">10 March 1829</span></span></a> [<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 187, 192]). <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> appears to have outmaneuvered his mother and forestalled criticism, however, by already completing <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> on <span class="date-1829-03-09">March 9</span>; or, at least, he created the fiction of having done so, by gathering together poems written at widely different times, composing some new ones, and peppering the little anthology with the <span class="date-1829-03-09">March 9</span> date. He then tried to turn the issue into a joke in a <a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1829-03-10_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter of <span class="date-1829-03-10">March 10</span></span></a>: “I believe my discourse has a conclusion, and a beginning too,” though his manner may not be analyzable in “the learned terms of Rhetoric” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 193).
                        The copying date of <span class="date-1829-03-09">March 9</span> is to some extent a fiction designed to forestall, on paper if not in actuality, his fatherʼs censure of <span class="date-1829-03-10">March 10</span>. The later poems in this group, at least, could have been composed and copied no earlier than <span class="date-1829-03-13">March 13</span> (see no. 53  <a href="/apparatuses/far_towards_chelsea_apparatus" target="_self">“Another” (<span class="title-poem-JRFARTOWARDSCHELSEA">“Far towards Chelsea”</span>)</a>). Still, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was able to compose and copy very rapidly. As he remarks in his fatherʼs <a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1829-05-10_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-"><span class="date-1829-05-10">1829 birthday</span> letter</span></a>, “the last year of my life was the happiest . . . because I have had more to do than I could do without all possible cramming and ramming and wishing days were longer and sheets of paper broader” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 200). Archly, he rounded out the section with a series of “fragments”, <a href="/apparatuses/the_summit_of_skiddaw_apparatus" target="_self">“A Fragment” (<span class="title-poem-JRTHESUMMITOFSKIDDAW">“The summit of <span class="geogName-SKIDDAW">skiddaw</span> was gilt by the sun”</span>)</a>, <a href="/apparatuses/the_world_apparatus" target="_self">“A Fragment” (<span class="title-poem-JRTHEWORLDTHATINITSORBITFLIES">“The world that in its orbit flies”</span>)</a>, 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/far_towards_chelsea_apparatus" target="_self">“Another” (<span class="title-poem-JRFARTOWARDSCHELSEA">“Far towards Chelsea”</span>)</a>, 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/on_the_noble_ben_lomond_apparatus" target="_self">“Another” (<span class="title-poem-JRONTHENOBLEBENLOMOND">“On the noble Ben Lomond arose the bright sun”</span>)</a>, 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/thy_winding_rivers_apparatus" target="_self">“Another” (<span class="title-poem-JRTHYWINDINGRIVERS">“Thy winding rivers <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> and thy rocks”</span>)</a>(nos. 51–55), some new and some abstracted from older poems. When the <span class="date-1829-03-09">March 9</span> group of smaller poems were entered, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> followed with the resumption of <span class="title-poem-JRMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span> (see no. 46  <a href="/apparatuses/monastery_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">“The Monastery”</span></a>).
                        For some of these poems, earlier composition dates can be established. The remainder are arranged here, under <span class="date-1829-03-09">9 March 1829</span>, for want of a better evidence. <span class="title-poem-JROFROCKSFIRST">“Of rocks first and of carverns now I sing”</span>, the first in the group, presents a special problem. Its subject is “<span class="placeName-MATLOCK">Matlock</span>ʼs rocks . . . white as snow,” but <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs opportunity to explore the mines and caverns around <span class="placeName-MATLOCK">Matlock</span> appears not to have come until <span class="date-1830-06-21-1830-09-22">summer 1830</span> (<a href="/notes/bibliography#TOURLAKES" target="_self"><span class="title-book-TOURLAKES"><i>A Tour to the Lakes in Cumberland</i></span></a>, 32–33, 51–56). If he did visit <span class="placeName-DERBYSHIRE">Derbyshire</span> before the <span class="date-1830-06-21-1830-09-22">1830 tour</span>, this poem is the sole manuscript evidence. In <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> associates <span class="placeName-MATLOCK">Matlock</span> with <span class="date-1829">1829</span>; but the autobiographyʼs dates are not reliable (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#TOURLAKES" target="_self"><span class="title-book-TOURLAKES"><i>A Tour to the Lakes in Cumberland</i></span></a>, 67 n. 33), and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> might well have derived that date from <span class="title-poem-JROFROCKSFIRST">“Of rocks first and of caverns now I sing”</span>.
                        More likely, <span class="title-poem-JROFROCKSFIRST">“Of rocks first and of caverns now I sing”</span> reflects <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs preparation for his <span class="date-1830">1830</span> geological pursuits with research in some guidebook, illustration, or description. As <span class="persName-MBVS">Michael Brooks</span> mentions, although not in connection with no. <span class="title-poem-JROFROCKSFIRST">“Of rocks first and of caverns now I sing”</span>, <span class="persName-ME">Maria Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED">Harry and Lucy</span> pay a geological visit to <span class="placeName-MATLOCK">Matlock</span>, which might have absorbed <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> (“Love and Possession in a Victorian Household: The Example of the Ruskins,” in <i>The Victorian Family: Structure and Stress</i>, ed. Anthony S. Wohl [New York: St. Martinʼs, 1978], pp. 91–92). Likewise, in <span class="title-lesson-JRMINERALOGICALNOTES">“Mineralogical Notes”</span> <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drew on a literary source for geology, and possibly at about the same time he composed <span class="title-poem-JROFROCKSFIRST">“Of rocks first and of caverns now I sing”</span> (<a href="/apparatuses/mineralogical_notes_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-lesson-JRMINERALOGICALNOTES">“Mineralogical Notes”</span></a> unfortunately presents dating enigmas of its own).
                        The alternative is to date <span class="title-poem-JROFROCKSFIRST">“Of rocks first and of caverns now I sing”</span> as <span class="date-1830-06-21-1830-09-22">summer 1830</span> or after, when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> is known to have visited <span class="placeName-MATLOCK">Matlock</span>. Physical evidence shows this to be possible, since the lines are positioned at the beginning of the <span class="date-1829-03-09">9 March 1829</span> group, following a blank page, and therefore could have been inserted later. (The lines also wrap around a drawing of a mountain landscape and castle, but that only tells us that the drawing probably predates the poem.) Still, the notation “<span class="date-1829-03-09">9th 1829</span>” is clearly applied to <span class="title-poem-JROFROCKSFIRST">“Of rocks first and of caverns now I sing”</span>, and by <span class="date-1830">1830</span> <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would no longer have any reason to falsify the date his little anthology.
