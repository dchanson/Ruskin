                    Forward from front of book:
                    a)  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>,  no. 91 (pp. 1r-58r; or, in other terms, 1r-v [title page and argument] + pp. 1-57 [as numbered by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, with inaccuracies already mentioned] + 30v-58r).
                    b)  Athens,  no. 135 (59r-61v), with the poem itself (six stanzas only) appearing on 60r-61v; incomplete fair copy (see no. 135).
                    c) Blank leaves, 62r-113r.
                    Forward from end of book (see "Account" apparatus, draft of composite):
                    d) Blank inside flyleaf and 162v-r.
                    e) Poem,  <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus#JRTHERHINE" target="_self"><span class="title-composite-JRTHERHINE"><span class="placeName-RHINE">The Rhine</span></span></a> 
                        (161v, dated <span class="date-1833">1833</span>; Works, 2:368-69), and poem,  
                        <a href="/apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus#JRCHAMOUNI" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRCHAMOUNI"><span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</span></span></a>  (161r-59v, dated <span class="date-1833">1833</span>; Works, 2:382-84), both of them sections of no. 180. Copied by another hand, probably Margaret’s. Items e-h have the appearance of having all been fair-copied at around the same time, as if these pieces were being anthologized for some reason.
                    f) No. 244, untitled, copied in the same hand (probably Margaret’s), and dated  October 1st <span class="date-1836">1836</span>  (159v-55r).
                    g) No. B, Undatable, partial copy in the same hand, probably Margaret’s (154v-r).
                    h) No. 204, copied in the same hand, probably Margaret’s (153v-50v).
                    i) As noted above ( Description ) and in the Library Edition (Works 2:27 n. 1, 45 n. 2a; not mentioned, however, in the description of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span>, Works, 2:532), a copybook was dismembered and tipped in to the back, starting between leaves 149 and 147 and continuing until between leaves 115 and 113. This booklet contains no. 251 (a copy probably by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, with annotations attributed to <span class="persName-WHH">W. H. Harrison</span>), and no. 256 (also a copy probably by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>). There are a total of 18 leaves. It can no longer be positively confirmed that these leaves once formed a single  thin copybook  (see  Description  above)--as opposed, say, to two separate booklets, one for each poem. There is no reason to doubt the claim, however, since all leaves measure the same size, 19 x 22.8 cm.
                    Title page:  The Gipsies / a Poem / by / <span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span> Aetat 18 / <span class="date-1837">1837</span>  (1r, verso blank); 9 leaves, following the title-page leaf, which are numbered pp. 1-17 in the copyist’s hand, and written on both sides (except for the final page).
                    Title page:  The Exile of St. Helena / by <span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span> / Aetat 19 / <span class="date-1838">1838</span>  (11r, and 11v blank, if one counts these leaves continuously from  The Gipsies ); 7 leaves, following the title-page leaf, written on both sides (except for the final page). These leaves were not numbered by the copyist, but the lines of poetry were numbered and, on that basis, nothing appears to be missing.</div>

                        Title page (1r):  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">ITERIAD</span> / or / THREE WEEKS / AMONG / the / LAKES / <span class="date-1831">1831</span>. The title page, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> displayed in fancy lettering drawn from Butterworth’s Young Arithmetician’s Instructor: Containing Specimens of Writing with Directions (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a> 259, 261 n. 17) is reproduced in <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>, or Three Weeks among the Lakes, ed. <span class="persName-JSD">James S. Dearden</span>(Newcastle upon Tyne: Frank Graham, <span class="date-1969">1969</span>), among the illustrations between pp. 32 and 33. Similar lettering occurs in some of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin's</span> letters to his father in <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span>.
                    On the verso of the title page, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drew another fancily lettered  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>,  followed by  Book First / The argument  and a prose summary of the first book’s contents. Each of the three remaining books begins much the same way, without  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  repeated, but with a fancy ornament separating the text of the argument from the poem.
                    Title page (59r):  ATHE[NS / OR THE]  and on the verso (59v)  [Canto First],  with the bracketed letters representing what <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> only sketched in pencil from his orthography primer, without finishing the letters in ink. At the top of the following page, halfway down on which begins the poem, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> penciled  [THE ARGUMENT]  and left a space for a prose summary, like those that begin the books of <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>. 
                    Tipped in between the front marbled flyleaves, <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn(?)</span> added a page on which is pasted a description of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span> clipped from PJR, as was done for other manuscripts that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> had already described. On this sheet, <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn(?)</span> provides information about material tipped in at the back of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span>:  His father’s copy of ‘The Gipsies’ & ‘The Exile of St Helena,’ formerly in one thin copybook have now been inserted in this book.</div>
