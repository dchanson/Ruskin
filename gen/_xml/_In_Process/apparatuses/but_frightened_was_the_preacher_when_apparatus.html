                        Monastery</i></span> (no. 46), referring the reader to chapter 35. No such episode
                        occurs in that chapter, and, in any case, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs versification never
                        extended beyond the opening chapters of the novel. Still more mysteriously,
                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> quotes a “note in his fatherʼs handwriting:—‘See <span class="title-series-SCOTTCANONGATE">Chronicles of
                        the Canongate</span>; the Flute & Drum & Bagpipe; the latter having no
                        beauty.’” No such note by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> has been found with the manuscript, and
                        <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs reference is equally illusive, <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> having failed to locate it
                        in any of the <span class="title-series-SCOTTCANONGATE">Chronicles of the Canongate</span> novels (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="title-book-RFL">RFL</span></a>, 171 n. 2).</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">The poemʼs echoing martial music seems to dovetail with the end of no. 33,
                        adapted from <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>ʼs <span class="title-book-SCOTTWAVERLEY"><i>Waverley</i></span>. No “frightened preacher” hears the “music of
                        the clans” in that novel, but <span class="persName-fictional-EDWARDWAVERLEY">Edward</span> listens to the bagpipes of the
                        retreating <span class="geogName-SCOTTISHHIGHLANDS">Highland</span> forces, from which he has been cut off. Perhaps <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>
                        was thinking of <span class="persName-fictional-EDWARDWAVERLEY">Edward</span>ʼs disguise as a divinity student in the next chapter.
                        If so, and this poem forms part of the versification of <span class="title-book-SCOTTWAVERLEY"><i>Waverley</i></span> in no. 33,
                        it may have originally been intended as text for a puppet performance of the
                        battle (see no. 35).</div>
