                  <div class="p">These handmade books, the so-called  Sermon Books,  bear no title by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> except for the titles he gave to the individual sermons (a paper cover to book A reading  Sermons Written by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> as a Child  is in an unknown hand, perhaps Ladd-Thomas’s). All books roughly 15.5 × 9.5 cm, except for slightly larger blank covers on some books; all except <span class="title-manuscript-MSIIE">IIE</span> constructed of sheets folded in half and hand-sewn and written in black ink. <span class="title-manuscript-MSIIE">MS IIE</span>, once sewn, now consists of loose sheets containing both ink fair-copy holograph and rough draft in pencil. Beginning with 3v of <span class="title-manuscript-MSIIA">IIA</span> and continuing throughout all the booklets, the ink script is  justified --that is, a line is ruled in pencil down the right and left margins, about 1 cm from the edge, and the script is kept carefully within the lines to mimic printed text. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> left no top or bottom margins.
                    IIA. Fifteen unnumbered leaves, with the sixteenth leaf cut away; text begins 1r, ends 15v; no cover. Despite the missing leaf, sermon 5, which is divided between <span class="title-manuscript-MSIIA">MS IIA</span> and <span class="title-manuscript-MSIIB">MS IIB</span>, reads uninterruptedly.
                    IIB. Twelve unnumbered leaves; text begins 1r, ends 12v; paper cover, identical to folios only slightly larger. On several leaves and the outside back cover, a penciled draft is visible, usually erased and lightly visible beneath the ink script but sometimes remaining intact and upside-down to the finished text.
                    IIC. Ten unnumbered leaves; text begins 1r, ends 10v; stiff blue cover, once sewn to text leaves but now loose, and larger than text leaves by 1 cm each way.
                    IID. Sixteen unnumbered leaves; text begins 1r, ends 16v; stiff brown cover, larger than text leaves by 1 cm each way.
                    IIE. Consists of loose leaves and folios, a few of which show evidence on left margins of having once been sewn, containing both fair and rough copy, as follows: 
                    (a) Fair copy of sermons <span class="title-manuscript-MSXVII">XVII</span> (conclusion continued from <span class="title-manuscript-MSIID">MS IID</span>), <span class="title-manuscript-MSXVIII">XVIII</span>, <span class="title-manuscript-MSXIX">XIX</span>, and <span class="title-manuscript-MSXX">XX</span> (beginning only), consisting of cover with four leaves. Cover.--Front or back only, other half having been cut away; identical to text leaves; on recto, rough pencil geometry diagram; verso blank. Text.--Ink fair-copy holograph; text begins 1r, ends 4r with 4v blank.
                    (b) Pencil draft, labelled by <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span>  Sermon [<span class="title-manuscript-MSXX">XX</span> and] <span class="title-manuscript-MSXII">XXI</span> in rough draft,  but <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself provided no headings and no direct indication of the proper order of these pieces. Their physical characteristics are as follows (n.b.--these may need reordering eventually): (b.1) One leaf, recto beginning  1. draws out the duties,  verso blank. (b.2) One folio, watermark <span class="date-1832">1832</span>; 1r beginning  Deuterony [sic] 30.19 ; 1v blank except a little watercolor of an amalgam of cubes, perhaps a crystal; 2r beginning  We are like the seed ; 2v, likely continuous from 2r, beginning  would obey him.  (b.3) One leaf, recto beginning  Deut. 28-1,  verso blank. (b.4) One folio, 1r beginning  Now what is life ; 1v, rough geometrical diagram; 2r beginning  Provision for intercourse ; 2v blank. (b.5) One leaf, 1r beginning  The only difference,  1v blank except for meaningless doodles.</div>
