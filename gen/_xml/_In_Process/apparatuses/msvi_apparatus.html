                        In the time since <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> described the manuscript, its  reddish marbled paper covers  have disappeared, replaced by a dark red leather 
                        or roan binding, 32.5 × 11.5 cm, with  Ruskin MS.--Poems  impressed in gilt on the spine and cover. Arrangements for this binding would have 
                        been made by <span class="persName-AW">Alexander Wedderburn</span>, since the  limp roan  described in <span class="title-catalogue-SOTHEBYCAT1930">Sotheby Cat.</span> <span class="date-1931">1931</span>
                        and the  red leather  mentioned in <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Goodspeed, Cat.</span>, must refer to the same binding.
                        The original notebook was purchased, not handmade, with marbled edges and pre-ruled paper, watermarked  J Wh[at(?)]man 1829.

                        Collation
                        Because <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span> is a rough-draft notebook, the sequence of its contents reveals their rough order of composition. 
                        This evidence is obscured in places by 
                        folios having been torn out, destroying many drafts both of poems known from copies elsewhere and of pieces that apparently existed only here. Fortunately, 
                        there remains in the back of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span> <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin's</span> own index, giving us the sequence 
                        and at least the titles of the lost entries. The mutilation had already occurred 
                        when <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> first described the manuscript for PJR, and evidence suggests that <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span> 
                        himself tore out the pages--or at least that the destruction, if not
                        by him, occurred during the notebook’s use. Interpretation of the index involves some speculation, since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> renumbered some
                        pages after some folios were torn 
                        out, and, later, someone else also took a hand to numbering pages; however, the use of the notebook can be broadly reconstructed as follows. The first 57 pages 
                        are missing (as <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> also remarks, although he errs in listing only one other  page  as missing elsewhere in the book: 
                        there are, in fact, three other missing
                        folios, as discussed below). The next pages 58-85 were accurately numbered by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, though with even numbers unconventionally
                        assigned to rectos. The versos were
                        likely odd-numbered from the beginning, since page 57 is the last missing--i.e., the folio, pp. 56-57. Following p. 85 (a verso), two folios (pp. 86-87 and 88-89) 
                        were completely torn out, leaving stubs to attest to their former existence. With their removal, two works were irrevocably lost--according to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin's</span> index,  <span class="title-poem-JRRUSTICINLONDON">Rustic in London</span>
                        [p.] 87  (no. 120), and  <span class="title-poem-JRHEAT">Heat</span> [p.] 88  (no. 121). Possibly the draft of some portion of  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span> [p.] 88  was lost, as well (see below). Clearly, these two 
                        folios were removed during the notebook’s use, since the index lists the extant poem  <span class="title-poem-JRCREATION">Creation</span>  (no. 129) on page 91 (a verso), a number at which one can arrive only 
                        by counting the two missing folios that fell just before the folio with  <span class="title-poem-JRCREATION">Creation</span>. The index entry for  <span class="title-poem-JRCREATION">Creation</span>  reads in full as  <span class="title-poem-JRCREATION">Creation</span> 91 86,  with  86  lined 
                        up with a column consistent with other entries. This mystery may be solved two ways: As one possibility,  <span class="title-poem-JRCREATION">Creation</span>  or a related poem may originally have been drafted
                        on the first of the two missing folios (the former pp. 86-87), and that earlier draft or related poem has simply been lost. This possibility is supported by the extant
                        poem opening with  "The second day past oer and gloomy night,"  as if an earlier poem had described
                        the first day. As a second possibility, both of the index numbers 
                        referred to the same poem, but <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> corrected  91  to  86  after tearing out the two folios. Two problems arise from this explanation.
                        First, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had to err, since
                        the poem occurs, according to revised numbering, on the verso, page 87, not on the recto, page 86. Second,  86  appears to be the earlier index entry, not one added as
                        a correction. Thus, the former possibility is easier to accept, but <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> has befuddled explanation by tearing away approximately a 
                        quarter-page from the top of the 
                        folio with the extant  <span class="title-poem-JRCREATION">Creation</span>,  thus losing any page numbers he might have written. What is certain is that, prior to the notebook’s mutilation, the extant poem  
                        <span class="title-poem-JRCREATION">Creation</span>  had been indexed for p. 91; and, following the notebook’s mutilation, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin's</span> new (visible) numbering starts on the page after 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRCREATION">Creation</span> --i.e., the new page 88,
                        formerly (presumably) page 92. By tearing away the top of the folio holding the extant  <span class="title-poem-JRCREATION">Creation</span>,  <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>
                        also destroyed most of the first stanza of the intriguing no. 122 
                        from its recto and, from its verso, something that preceded the fragment no. 128 ( tis not the proper measure ). On the next recto following this mutilated folio, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin's</span>
                        revised page numbering is visible, pp. 88-89. The index gives as its last two page numbers for  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  (though more was to be written, if not indexed, in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>)  88  and 
                        92.  These entries present a puzzle similar to that for  <span class="title-poem-JRCREATION">Creation</span>.  The newly numbered pp. 88 and 92 do hold  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span> --the former even entitled  <span class="title-book-JRITERIAD_BK$">Iteriad Book 4th</span>  and 
                        starting with line 27. That p. 88, however, according to the old numbering, would have been p. 92, and the old p. 88, now removed, might well have contained  <span class="title-poem-JRITERAID">Iteriad</span>  
                        draft--in fact, there are very good reasons to believe it did (see note, no. 91).Thus, while definite conclusions cannot be drawn, probabilities suggest that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> stopped
                        his indexing not long after he mutilated the notebook, and that all his index numbers refer, therefore, to his earlier numbering. That is, an earlier version of  <span class="title-poem-JRCREATION">Creation</span> 
                        (probably describing the  first day ) once existed on the missing p. 86; some  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  draft was lost with the removed p. 88; not long before removing pp. 86-89, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had
                        indexed his latest  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  draft as  92  and, after the removal of 86-89, he renumbered that same p. 92 on the
                        page itself as p. 88. The extant folio, pp. 88-89 (new numbering),
                        following the torn folio holding  <span class="title-poem-JRCREATION">Creation</span>,  would formerly have been p. 92; but it is numbered  88  with no sign
                        of a prior erasure. It appears, then, that when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> reached 
                        about this point--the composition of  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>,  4:27-68--he for some reason tore out the two missing folios, started
                        his new page numbering, and halted his indexing for  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>.
                        (Alternatively, the mutilation and renumbering could conceivably have occurred somewhat later, when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> reached about three hundred 
                        lines into book 4. This possibility will be 
                        discussed below.) This means that poems indexed as falling on pages after this watershed had already been drafted; otherwise, their index entries would refer to the new page
                        numbering, and this theory seems borne out by the disposition of the remaining pages. Following the newly numbered pp. 88-89, yet another folio has been removed, what would have 
                        been pp. 90-91, according to the new numbering. A remaining stub attests to the folio’s existence and shows that it once held  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  draft on the recto--at least, line 95 of book 4,
                        a line continuous with 4:69-94 at the bottom of p. 89. The next existing folio was numbered 90-91. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin's</span> index mentions  <span class="title-poem-JRDEARTEPOETICA">De arte poetica</span> [p.] 94  (no. 130), a title that is nowhere 
                        extant in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>. If one counts pages, including all three missing folios, prior to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin's</span> renumbering (i.e., when the second-day  <span class="title-poem-JRCREATION">Creation</span>  poem was correctly indexed as p. 91), one 
                        will arrive at pp. 94-95 for the third missing folio. Thus,  <span class="title-poem-JRDEARTEPOETICA">De arte poetica</span>  was lost with this folio, and it likely existed prior to the new page numbering--i.e., prior to the 
                        composition of  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  4:27ff., which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> reached about <span class="date-1831-06-21-1831-09-22">summer 1831</span>  (see note to no. 91), or perhaps somewhat later when he had reached 300 lines into book 4 (see below). A 
                        fragment of  <span class="title-poem-JRDEARTEPOETICA">De arte poetica</span>  may, nonetheless, have been retained. At the top of the recto following the third missing folio--i.e., on what would formerly have been p. 95, now numbered
                        p. 90--a fragment appears to have been carried over from the previous page (two stanzas extant, the first of which is incomplete). The subject of this fragment, no. 131, is consistent 
                        with  <span class="title-poem-JRDEARTEPOETICA">De arte poetica</span>,  no. 130, and the two may be the same poem. A few other index entries point to the old numbering, <span class="date-1831-05-1831-07-22">before midsummer</span>:  <span class="title-poem-JRBED">Bed</span> [p.] 102,   <span class="title-poem-JRETERNALHILLS">Eternal hills</span> [p.] 103,
                        and  <span class="title-poem-JRFUN">Fun</span> [p.] 103.  These poems--the former two untitled in draft (nos. 133-34), and the latter entitled  different style  in draft but with a refrain  
                        Fun fun &c  (no. 136)--now fall on pp. 96-97, a folio that would have been numbered pp. 102-3 prior to removal of all three missing folios. Thus, these three poems, too, 
                        likely preexisted the composition of  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  4:27ff. or 4:300ff., when the missing folios were removed. This means that these poems should not regarded as composed sequentially 
                        with the draft of  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  presently surrounding them but that they were composed earlier and the  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  draft wrapped around them. This arrangement may be confirmed by the appearance
                        of the manuscript: on p. 96 (i.e., formerly, p. 102)  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  4:247-61 extends from the top of the page down to the beginning of  <span class="title-poem-JRBED">Bed</span>,  which runs to the bottom of the page. At the top 
                        of p. 97 (i.e., formerly, p. 103), <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> squeezed in just one line of  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>,  4:262, before  <span class="title-poem-JRETERNALHILLS">Eternal Hills</span>  and  <span class="title-poem-JRFUN">Fun</span>  take up the remainder of the page; then  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  recommences 
                        with 4:263ff. on the next page. Another index entry,  <span class="title-poem-JRWHEREISJOY">Joy, where is</span> [p.] 97  (no. 132), can be made to correspond with the poem itself only by counting all three missing folios. 
                        It presently falls on p. 91; thus, it probably predates the  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  draft surrounding it--4:101ff. that follows it, and  <span class="title-poem-JRCOMINGDOWNUPONAMBLESIDE">Coming down upon Ambleside</span>  (4:383-402) that precedes it (see below).
                        The passage  <span class="title-poem-JRCOMINGDOWNUPONAMBLESIDE">Coming down upon Ambleside</span>  is responsible for the suggestion, already mentioned, that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin's</span> mutilation and renumbering of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span> may have occurred somewhat later than the 
                        composition of  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  4:27-68. The  <span class="title-poem-JRCOMINGDOWNUPONAMBLESIDE">Ambleside</span>  passage, which is placed (and perhaps written) out of sequence in the notebook, is cross-referenced by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin's</span> own note later on,  
                        FROM LINE 375 TO LINE 401 AT PAGE NINETY SIX ; since  page ninety six  refers to the old numbering, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may not have yet removed the missing folios before composing book 4 into the 300s.
                        Unfortunately, the pages holding these shorter poems composed earlier than their surrounding  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  draft do not show erasure of a former page numbering. The page with  <span class="title-poem-JRWHEREISJOY">Where Is Joy</span>  (no. 132)
                        is unnumbered; only the recto of that folio is numbered (the new p. 90). The same is true of  <span class="title-poem-JRETERNALHILLS">Eternal Hills</span>  and  <span class="title-poem-JRFUN">Fun</span>,  whose page (a verso) is unnumbered, with its recto numbered (the new p. 96).
                        The latter page is the location of  <span class="title-poem-JRBED">Bed</span>,  but there is no sign of an erasure of the former p. 102 (as  <span class="title-poem-JRBED">Bed</span>  is indexed) beneath the new p. 96. One can only assume that, with the earlier 
                        numbering system, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> either indexed these poems by counting his pages, without marking the pages themselves, or wrote the numbers on the pages themselves in erasable pencil.
                        The composition of book 4 of  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  (new p. 88 and following) is complex; full discussion will be found in the note to no. 91. It may be generally remarked here that this part 
                        of the manuscript is given over to partly drafting, partly schematizing line arrangements of draft from elsewhere. Thus, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> is by now, perhaps, starting to fair-copy  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span> 
                        in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span>. This task may partly account for the removal of the three missing folios from <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>. If so, one wonders why <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not mutilate <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span> after having completely finished 
                        the draft of book 4, rather than toward the onset of its composition.
                        Starting with the first page of his new system (p. 88, holding  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  4:27-67), and not counting removed folios, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> numbered rectos only with even numbers through page 100 
                        (only failing to indicate the new p. 94, which is unnumbered). On the last of these pages,  100  is written over top of an erroneous  99,  and another hand has also numbered this
                        latter page as 100 in pencil. This new hand numbers the next recto in pencil as 101 and continues, 101-35. Since p. 135 falls on an endpaper that does not appear part of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin's</span>
                        original notebook, this hand must be later--probably <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn's</span>, after the manuscript acquired its present binding.

                    Content	
                    <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span> falls into fairly distinct sections. In their sequence of appearance, the contents are as follows:
                    a) The sequence of the titles in the missing part of the manuscript can be reconstructed as nos. 70 (p. 6), 71 (p. 8), 
                    73 (p. 10), 74 (p. 12), 75 (p. 13), 76 (p. 21), 77(?) (p. 25, see no. 77), 
                    92 (p. 28), 93 (p. 29), 94 (p. 30), 95 (p. 31), 91 (p. 32; this is bk. 3, indexed under both  <span class="title-poem-JRSKIDDAW1891">Skiddaw</span>  and  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span> ), 
                    96 (p. 37), 77(?) (p. 39, see no. 77), 97 (p. 40), 100 (p. 46), 101 (p. 47), 102 (p. 48), 91 (p. 48, some portion,
                    presumably of book 3 or beginning of book 1), 103 (p. 49), 104 (p. 51), 105 (p. 51), 106 (no p. no., but see no. 106),
                    107 (p. 52), 91 (p. 54, some portion presumably of bk. 1).
                    b) In the extant portion of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>, from p. 58, the roughly continuous record of poetry composition continues. Extant 
                    are drafts of books 1, 2, and 4 of  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>,  no. 91, which are listed as follows, broken down into their parts and 
                    interspersed with shorter poems, to show their sequence: no. 91 (pp. 58-74; bk. 1:176-518, and bk. 2: 1-400; probably 
                    listed as  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span> 54  in index), 109 (p. 75, confirmed by index,  <span class="title-poem-JRPOESIE">Poesie</span> 75 ),

                        draft, i.e., five lines not identical but closely related to later occurence of poem), 91 (p. 80; bk. 2:668-83; not listed in index, almost certainly owing to later 
                        insertion), 113 (p. 81; remaining 4 lines of stanza 3), 116 (p. 81; full draft; listed as  <span class="title-poem-JRLIFE">Life</span> 81  in index), 91 (p. 81, beneath rule at bottom of page; bk. 2:684-88;

                        i.e., old pp. 86-89], 122 (unnumbered partially torn folio, i.e., old p. 90; no identifiable listing in index), 123 (unnumbered partially torn folio, i.e., old p. 90;

                        91 (new pp. 90-91; bk. 4:383-408; entitled here  <span class="title-poem-JRCOMINGDOWNUPONAMBLESIDE">Coming down upon Ambleside</span>  and lines unnumbered; not indexed), 132 (new pp. 91-92; listed as  <span class="title-poem-JRWHEREISJOY">Joy, where is</span> 97  in 
                        index, i.e., old p. 97), 91 (new pp. 92-96; bk. 4:101-261; not indexed), 133 (new p. 96; listed in index as  <span class="title-poem-JRBED">Bed</span> 102,  i.e., old p. 102), 91 (new p. 97; bk. 4:262;

                        98; bk. 4:264-326 [these lines numbered differently in the draft--i.e., 248-313--than in their final fair copy, whose numbering is cited here, for the sake of clarity;
                        some of these lines indicated in this draft only by their opening words or by a note referring to where they will be found in some other manuscript]), 91 (new pp. 99-100r,
                        100v, and pp. 101-5 by later hand; 4:327-696 [numbered differently in this draft--i.e., 314-704--than their final numbering in fair copy; at line 382 (i.e., <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin's</span> line 
                        376), there is a note to pick up lines 383-408 from earlier in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>:  from line 375 to line 401 at page ninety six --i.e., old p. 96, now new p. 90 with the section 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRCOMINGDOWNUPONAMBLESIDE">Coming down upon Ambleside</span> ), 91 (pp. 107-8 in new hand;  Notes  to  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>,  book 1, scored through in draft).
                    c) Pp. 130-32: index to <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>. The index was constructed by listing letters of the alphabet equally spaced down the page; then the titles were entered in the spaces under 
                    the headings. This was done in ink, while in pencil on these pages and the following folio, 133-34, are some multiplication and addition exercises. These exercises accord
                    with the lessons starting in <span class="date-1831">1831</span> that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> is known to taken from <span class="persName-JROWBOTHAM">Mr. Rowbotham</span> ( sums are advancing in very good style,  <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> announced in <span class="date-1832-01">January 1832</span>,  addition
                        subtraction multiplication and division,  but he thought Rowbotham’s instruction made up of  disagreeable et ceteras  and to be  a dry, and entertainmentless thing  [<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a> 
                    258, 268, and see 261 n. 11].) Also on p. 134 is a fragment of verse,  "The [gem(?)] Oh [gemini(?) how monstrous pretty tale / Ah what a deal of trouble authors ye / Ye 
                    ladies Wayward fancie for to hit--." 
                    d) Probably after the index was started on page 130, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> used the preceding p. 129, working upside down and in the opposite direction to the rest of the book, for
                    nos. 87, 88, and 90 (no. 90 dated <span class="date-1830-09-10">10 September 1830</span>). No. 90 continues from p. 129 backwards to page 126.
                    e) Various items are scattered throughout pages remaining in the space between c-d at the back of the manuscript and a-b coming from the front. Reading from the back,
                    and upside down to text coming from front of book: On p. 124, a four-stanza poem,  <span class="title-poem-ANDREWSELIZABRAVEHUSSAR">The Brave Hussar</span>.  This is copied, not in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin's</span> hand, but possibly <span class="persName-JJR">John James's</span>; 
                    in any case, the poem is signed by, or attributed to,  <span class="persName-EAO">Eliza Andrews</span> --probably the daughter of <span class="persName-EA">Edward Andrews</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin's</span> tutor, who had a child by this name.
                    On p. 123, a four-line fragment ( "I think that the elements are contramacious / Such a huge disposition they showed for to splash us / For if we did but wish on some 
                    day to go out / That day they were sure to kick up such a rout" ). This is headed   <span class="title-book-JRITERIAD_BK3">3rd book</span>,  no doubt referring to  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>.  The passage is scored through, and apparently 
                    it was not ultimately used.
                        On pp. 110-11, rough pen-and-ink sketches for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour of the Continent</span>, <span class="date-1833">1833</span>, no. 180. The first shows a Swiss cottage and bridge, and the drawing is 
                        captioned  No. 1. Head [i.e., at the head of a poem or prose selection of no. 180, as fair-copied and illustrated in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>]. The Swiss Cottages.  Alongside this drawing
                        is one of a gothic fountain, captioned  No 2. Tail. Swiss Cottages.  Following these is a rocky, narrow path alongside a cliff, with a horse and rider proceeding toward 
                        a distant town; captioned,  No. 1. Splugen. Head.  Enclosed in rules, between the first two and the third drawings, is a note (but no sketches) for  No 3 head, William 
                        tell from boys own book  and  No 4. tail. Tells tower at Altorf.  On the opposite page (p. 111), <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drew a precipitous waterfall from high crags, captioned  Perhaps.
                        No. 2. Tail. The descent.  Alongside this, another sketch (including stone arches) is not captioned and too fragmentary for identification.
                        f) Much later in <span class="date-1838">1838</span>(?), <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> used remaining blank spaces to compose no. 270. This essay begins on p. 112 and goes forward to p. 125 (working around the <span class="persName-EAO">Eliza Andrews</span>
                        poem and  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  fragment in e); then, obstructed by no. 90 in d, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> continued the essay on available blank pages 106, 108-9, 111. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> numbered these pages in 
                        sequence, 1-18.</div>

                    Contrary to earlier assumptions (see Dearden, ed., Iteriad, 22), this manuscript probably was not used during the <span class="date-1830-06-21-1830-09-22">summer tour of 1830</span>, since poems associated

                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> on the <span class="date-1831-06-21-1831-09-22">summer tour of 1831</span> (see no. 91). </div>

                    As <span class="persName-">Collingwood</span> remarks, <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span> is a rough-copy book for  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  and for shorter poems, many of them copied into <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>. Unlike <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>, in which poems were fair-copied
                    in an order regardless of their dates of composition, <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span> reveals a compositional sequence of poems--some lost with the removal of folios. The sequence starts with
                    <span class="title-poem-JRVESUVIUS">Vesuvius</span>,  which is the earliest item listed in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin's</span> index. Since  <span class="title-poem-JRVESUVIUS">Vesuvius</span>  can be independently dated as <span class="date-1830-02-01-1830-02-28">February 1830</span>, and some other titles in the index can 
                    also be dated from other sources, conjectural dates can be assigned to pieces based on their relative positions in the manuscript.
                    Dates can be provisionally given even to titles of lost pieces, since their former positions are recorded in the index. Of course, we cannot be certain that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                    drafted the lost poems seriatim in the notebook, any more than we can assume that the extant poems form an undeviating sequence--and, as explained in  Description 
                    above and in no. 91, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did at times skip backwards and fill unused spaces. In broad outline, however, the titles of lost poems indicate interests that absorbed
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> from <span class="date-1830-01-01-1831-02-28">early 1830 to late February</span> or <span class="date-1830-01-01-1831-03-15">early March 1831</span>, the period covered in the lost portion of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>.
                    Throughout the notebook, shorter poems were interspersed with draft of  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>,  no. 91. The index tells us that  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  itself started life as a shorter poem,
                    <span class="title-book-JRITERIAD_BK1">The Ascent of Skiddaw</span>,  which would later become book 3 (see no. 91). The index cites p. 32 both for  <span class="title-book-JRITERIAD_BK1">Skiddaw</span>  and for the first of a series of pages for  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>.
                    <span class="title-book-JRITERIAD_BK1">Skiddaw</span>  was drafted, judging by its indexed position, starting in <span class="date-1830-12-15-1830-12-31">late December 1830</span> or <span class="date-1831-01-01-1831-01-15">early January 1831</span>, just following the lost piece  <span class="title-poem-JRREVOLUTION">Revolution</span>.  In <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span> 
                     <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> says he started  <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">Iteriad</span>  on <span class="date-1830-11-28">November 28, 1830</span>, either referring to <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span> and offsetting these calculations by just a month or referring to draft in another 
                    manuscript, now lost. </div>
