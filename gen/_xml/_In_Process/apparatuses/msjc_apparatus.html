                  <div class="p">In the bibliography of the Library Edition, section III (“Catalogue of Ruskin MSS.”), subsection B (“Diaries and Note‐books”), 
                        the editors list under “Note‐books” a group of manuscripts that they entitle “Juvenilia” 
                        (<a href="/" target="_self">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 38:206). 
                        They intend the categorical title “Juvenilia” to apply to all the “MSS., containing Poems, Geological Notes, etc., etc.,” 
                        comprised by their expanded version of <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwoodʼs</span> descriptive bibliography, “Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems” 
                        in volume 2 of the Library Edition 
                        (<a href="/" target="_self">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 2:529–34).
                        The title “Juvenilia” came to be applied in particular, however, to “three small books” that, in the main bibiography in volume 38, 
                        the editors note as an addendum to “those [MSS.] there described” in <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwoodʼs</span> “Preliminary Note” reprinted and expanded in volume 2 
                        (<a href="/" target="_self">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 38:206), 
                        these three notebooks being nowhere described. (<span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> omitted these three manuscripts from his original
                        “Preliminary Note” presumably because they contained no poetry by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>.)</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">As a result, the title “Juvenilia” stuck for these three notebooks in particular, as attested 
                        by the embossing of this title on the spine of the blue morocco slipcase containing the three notebooks, a slipcase that was constructed at perhaps the same time that the bibliography volume 
                        of the Library Edition was being compiled 
                        (see below, Location, Provenance). Consequently, the three notebooks came to be listed for sale under the title “Juvenilia” in 
                        <a href="/" target="_self">Sotheby & Co., <i>Catalogue of the Manuscripts and Remaining Library of John Ruskin</i></a>,

                  <div class="p">I have conventionalized the title “MS Juvenilia C” as referring to the third of the three notebooks, identified by the editors as (<i>c</i>) in their list of “Juvenilia”

                     <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> evidently planned this <a href="/" target="_self">Red Book</a> initially to serve as a travel diary for the famiy journey of <span class="date-1828">1828</span>. Beginning on 1v, he and <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> laid out the 
                            <a href="/" target="_self">Tour of 1828: Prospective Itinerary</a>, with the boy listing the sights for each stage of the journey, 
                            and the father following up and elaborating the list. The planned itinerary takes up 15 2‐page spreads (1v–16r), at the end of which the project runs up against <span class="persName-JR">Ruskinʼs</span> transcript of 
                            <a href="/" target="_self">“The Sound of the Sea”</a>, a poem by <span class="persName-FDH">Mrs. Hemans</span>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Once the family embarked on the actual journey, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> turned the <a href="/" target="_self">Red Book</a> upside down and, starting from the opposite end, 
                            entered the <a href="/" target="_self">Tour of 1828: Actual Itinerary</a>. 
                            This work took up only a single leaf (42v–42r), since the journey was unexpectedly cut short.</div>

                            positioned in the sequence coming from that end of the <a href="/" target="_self">Red Book</a>, and not upside down coming from the opposite end—the transcript likely belongs to the planning stage of the journey. 
                            It is also possible, however, that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> placed the poem at the end of the prospective itinerary after the actual journey was abandoned. It could even have predated the prospective itinerary.</div>

                            <a href="/" target="_self">“The Sound of the Sea”</a> is a sequence that follows the poem transcript and 18r, and that is made up of 
                            <a href="/" target="_self">“Wanting” [MSJC uncertain 4]</a> (18v), 
                            <a href="/" target="_self">Sketches of Machinery [MSJC uncertain 5]</a> (18v–19r, 20v–21r, 22r), and 
                            <a href="/" target="_self">Mineral List [MSJC uncertain 6]</a> (20r). The hand and color of ink used for much of this sequence appear to associate it 
                            with the <a href="/" target="_self">Notes on Mineralogy</a>, which runs sequentially from the opposite end of the <a href="/" target="_self">Red Book</a> (see below); however, the latter 
                            is written over top of one of the pencil sketches on 20v, so the order of composition and drawing here in the middle of the <a href="/" target="_self">Red Book</a> is unclear.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">At the opposite end of the <a href="/" target="_self">Red Book</a>, following <a href="/" target="_self">Tour of 1828: Actual Itinerary</a>—and, 
                            judging by the hand, not long after returning home from the familyʼs aborted journey—<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> recorded his geological interests. First, as if serving 
                            as a transition between the initial use of the <a href="/" target="_self">Red Book</a> as a travel diary and its recycled use as a mineralogy and geology notebook,
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> entered the brief <a href="/" target="_self">Description of Bowder Stone</a> in <span class="placeName-Borrowdale">Borrowdale</span>, which the family had failed to reach.
                            Then, immmediately following, he entered <a href="/" target="_self">“Minerals”</a>, a catalog of 105 minerals (41v–39r).</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">Later, probably in <span class="date-1831">1831</span> and/or <span class="date-1832">1832</span>, and in a cursive hand, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> used the recto immediately following “Minerals” to start 
                            <a href="/" target="_self">Notes on Mineralogy</a>. 
                            The Notes continue in the same direction as <a href="/" target="_self">Tour of 1828: Actual Itinerary</a> and 
                            <a href="/" target="_self">“Minerals”</a>, but <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> started numbering the pages from the first page (38v) of the 
                            <a href="/" target="_self">Notes on Mineralogy</a> (38v–22v, 21v–20v, 18r, 16v–11v, 10v–7r, 6r–5v, 4v–3v, 1v). The pagination extends 1–37 (38v–20v), but the Notes skip 22r, 
                            despite the page number (p.34) <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> entered there, apparently because at this point the Notes ran up against the final page of 
                            <a href="/" target="_self">Sketches of Machinery [MSJC uncertain 5]</a>, suggesting that these sketches predated at least this portion of the Notes. 
                            On 21v (p. 35), the Notes resume, taking up this page that contained no sketches. The Notes continue on 21r–20v (pp. 36–37), which do contain sketches, and the Notes overwrite a pencil sketch here, 
                            indicating again that the sketches predated them.</div> 
                     
                     <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> continued the pagination on 20r–19v with pp. 38–39, but he wrote p. 38 upside down to the <a href="/" target="_self">Mineral List [MSJC uncertain 6]</a> 
                            on this page, possibly indicating the latterʼs preexistence; and he entered p. 39 on an otherwise blank page. He did not write page numbers on the following 2‐page spread (19r–18v), 
                            which contains both <a href="/" target="_self">“Wanting” [MSJC uncertain 4]</a> and the first two pages of 
                            <a href="/" target="_self">Sketches of Machinery [MSJC uncertain 5]</a>—again suggesting the preexistence of these items, which, like 
                            <a href="/" target="_self">Mineral List [MSJC uncertain 6]</a> run upside down to the Notes. Although not showing pp. 40–41 on these pages, he resumes 
                            numbering in correct order (pp. 42–43) on 18r–17v, resuming the Notes on p. 42, formerly a blank page, and entering p. 43 reverso and upside down to the 1828 material coming from the opposite end 
                            of the <a href="/" target="_self">Red Book</a>—17v (p. 43) being the second page of <a href="/" target="_self">“The Sound of the Sea”</a>.</div>
                     
                     <div class="p">While <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> largely spared his neat transcript of Mrs. Hemansʼs poem, writing only page numbers (pp. 43–44) upside down and reverso to the poem, he resumed the Notes reverso to the 
                            <a href="/" target="_self">Tour of 1828: Prospective Itinerary</a>, inserting the Notes into spaces of the itinerary formerly left blank 
                            by him and his father. The Notes take up a page, 16v (p. 45), formerly left blank prior to the recto containing the poem; and then the Notes run reverso and upside down to the itinerary, 
                        16r–1v, numbered as pp. [46], 47, [48], 49, 50, [51], 52, 53, 54, [55], 56, [57], 58, [59–62], 63, [64], 65, [66], 67, [68], 69, 70, 70, [71], 72, [73], 74, with the bracketed numbers indicating that 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> entered no numbers on those page but nonetheless counted them in the pagination correctly, and with the repeated p. 70 indicating an incorrect doubling on successive pages. The Notes intrude 
                        on most pages of the itinerary, skipping over only 11r (p. 56), 6v (p. 65), 5r (p. [68]), and 3r–2r (pp.[71]–73). The entry on 1r (p. 74) is unique in being oriented in the same vertical direction as the 
                        surrounding itinerary.</div>

                            the size of lettering, but which appears generally to improve over the course of the work. 
                            The ink hand for <a href="/" target="_self">“The Sound of the Sea”</a> is remarkably small and neat, suggesting that control over his pen was part
                            of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskinʼs</span> purpose in making this transcription. He commanded a similar neat, ink lettering for <a href="/" target="_self">Description of Bowder Stone</a> 
                            and <a href="/" target="_self">“Minerals”</a>. For <a href="/" target="_self">Tour of 1828: Actual Itinerary</a>, however, 
                            he used cursive in ink. Among his earliest attempts at cursive using a pen, this hand must have helped him make efficient use of time during stops in the journey.</div>
