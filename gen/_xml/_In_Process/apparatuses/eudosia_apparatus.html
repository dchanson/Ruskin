                  <div class="p">On the first page of text (<span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span>, p. 2), an abbreviated title is given with a
                        date: <span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">“EUDOSIA / September 28th / 1828 / FIRST BOOK.”</span> Since the date is
                        neatly arranged in this space without crowding, it must not have been added
                        to commemorate the end of fair‐copying—an end that was never reached, in
                        any case, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> having numbered pages in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span> for the reception of poetry
                        that was never composed. <span class="date-1828-09-28">September 28</span> must therefore refer to the onset,
                        whether of the fair copy or of the draft.</div>

                        the draft in <span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span> falls before the birthday poem, no. 41, which he
                        attributed to <span class="date-1828-05">May 1828</span>, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> concluded that “<span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">‘Eudosia’</span> must therefore
                        have been commenced in <span class="date-1828-05">March</span> or <span class="date-1828-04">April 1828</span>” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JRPOEMS8D1891" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS8D1891"><i>PJR</i> [<span class="date-1891">1891</span>, 8<sup>o</sup>]</span></a>, 1:272).
                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>, however, misdated the birthday ode, which in fact belongs to
                        <span class="date-1829">1829</span> (see no. 41). The <span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">“Eudosia”</span> material preceding the ode may therefore be

                        September, with the fair copy following very soon thereafter, since draft
                        for book I, lines 121–60, appears in the late <span class="date-1828">1828</span> portion of <span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span>,

                        falls between no. 59 (probably <span class="date-1829-05">May</span>) and no. 60 (probably <span class="date-1829-05-1829-08">late May to early

                        decipher his draft after any lapse of time, since the words are jammed
                        pell‐mell on the page. For example, the fair‐copy lines “Of them are formed

                  <div class="p">Sources.—When commenting on <span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">“Eudosia”</span> in <span class="title-book-"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> could no longer
                        remember “where I got hold of this name, or what I understood by it”
                        (35:59). Undoubtedly, he got the title from <span class="title-poem-"><i>Eudosia, or a Poem on the
                        Universe</i></span> by <span class="persName-CL">Capell Lofft</span> (<span class="date-1781">1781</span>), which he would have found frequently quoted
                        in <span class="persName-JJ">Jeremiah Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="title-book-JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><i>Scientific Dialogues</i></span> (see no. 3). It is less clear
                        whether he got anything more than the titleʼs euphony; its meaning,
                        unexplained in <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>, is.... Aside from the quotations in <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>, <span class="persName-CL">Lofft</span>ʼs
                        poem seems a surprising choice for the Ruskinsʼ library. So far as I have
                        discovered, <span class="persName-CL">Lofft</span> had no connection with the Edgeworthsʼ system of
                        education, an association that frequently accounts for the selection of
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs early reading. <span class="persName-CL">Lofft</span>ʼs reputation, based partly on his scientific
                        achievements but mainly on his firebrand Whig politics, would surely have
                        appealed more to <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span> than to the Ruskins (<span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span> himself having been
                        arrested on suspicion of treason during the war with <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span>).</div>
