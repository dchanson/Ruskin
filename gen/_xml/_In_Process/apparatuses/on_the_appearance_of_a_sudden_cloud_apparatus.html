                  <div class="p">While complaints about <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>'s excessive smoke from industrial and domestic fires became common starting in the seventeenth century, 
                        <span class="persName-CLCORTON">Christine Corton</span> finds that the "true <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> fog as it came into being in the Victorian era" was marked by 
                        “yellow as a characteristic colour of [the] polluted air” and took “on a new character, thick, widespread, and prolonged.” 
                        Typically caused by temperature inversion, the fogs began “increasing in frequency” in the early nineteenth century, 
                        and “became even more frequent during the 1820s, when occurrences were reported in <span class="date-1820">1820</span>, <span class="date-1821">1821</span>, <span class="date-1822">1822</span>, <span class="date-1826">1826</span>, <span class="date-1828">1828</span>, and <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, 
                        though none of them seems to have lasted more than a couple of days”--a duration that seems reflected in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>'s description 
                        of the sudden appearance of the yellow cloud, and its dispersal after a storm. As documentation of the <span class="date-1828">1828</span> event that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>
                        presumably was responding to, <span class="persName-CLCORTON">Corton cites</span> a report of a fog in the Times for <span class="date-1828-11-13">13 November</span>, 
                        as well as the observations of the meteorologist and chemist <span class="persName-">Luke Howard</span> (<span class="date-1772-1864">1772-1864</span>), who recorded an "extreme dense fog all day" on that date

                        <div class="p">The fog of Wednesday has seldom been exceeded in opacity in the metropolis and its neighbourhood. 
                                    It began to thicken very much about half past twelve o’clock, from which time, till near two, 
                                    the effect was most distressing, making the eyes smart, and almost suffocating those who were in the street, 
                                    particularly asthmatic persons. In the city all the bankers, and offices of different descriptions, 
                                    as well as the principal shops, were obliged to have lights. To see with any distinctness further than across the street was impossible; 
                                    all the narrow lanes, beyond the perspective of a few yards, were absolutely in a state of darkness, 
                                    and in the great thoroughfares, the hallooing of coachmen and drivers to avoid each other, 
                                    seemingly issuing from the opaque mass in which they were enveloped, was calculated to awaken all the caution of riders, 
                                    as well as of pedestrians who had to cross the streets. On the <span class="geogName-THAMES">Thames</span>, as on land, the tendency which fog has to enlarge distant objects, 
                                    was strikingly illustrated; the smallest vessels on their approach seemed magnified to thrice their usual dimensions. 
                                    <span class="placeName-building-STPAULCATHEDRAL">St. Paul</span>'s had a prodigious effect through the mist, though neither that nor the monument were visible above the height of the houses. . . . 
                                    [The fog] cleared off a little about a quarter past two, but returned with all its density in the evening</div>

                  <div class="p">Did <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself experience the fog in the city, or even at home in Camberwell? How far did the affected “neighbourhood” of the metropolis extend? 
                        It is possible that the suburbs were enveloped, as <span class="persName-LH">Howard</span> quotes an 1816 report describing how, on the morning of <span class="date-1816-11-27">27 November</span>, 
                        the “neighbourhood of Walworth and Camberwell” grew “so completely dark” with “fog, combined with smoke”, 
                        that “coachmen . . . were obliged to get down and lead their horses with a lantern” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#HOWARDCLIMATEOFLONDON" target="_self"><span class="title-book-"><i>Climate of London</i></span></a>, 2:313). 
                        <span class="persName-CJHD">Dickens</span>, in <span class="title-CJHDOURMUTUALFRIEND">Our Mutual Friend</span>(<span class="date-1864-1865">1864–65</span>), treats a “foggy day” as “grey” in “the surrounding country” of <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, but turning “dark yellow” 
                        “at about the boundary line”, and growing “browner, and then browner, until at the heart of the City . . . it was rusty-black”; however, 
                        in context of the novel, the deepening color and darkness form a metaphor (<span class="persName-CJHD">Dickens</span>, <span class="title-CJHDOURMUTUALFRIEND">Our Mutual Friend</span>, 000 [bk. 3, chap. 1]; 
                        see <a href="/notes/bilbiography#CORTONLONDONFOG" target="_self"><span class="persName-CLCORTON">Corton</span>, <span class="title-book-CORTONLONDONFOG">London Fog</span></a>, 65-66). 
                        The yellow color, which resulted from tars precipitating from low-combustion domestic fires, likely gave way to darker colors over lengthening time 
                        rather than decreasing proximity to the city, as later in the day fires were compounded by industry emitting darker tars, soot, and smoke 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#NOVAKOVEYEWITNESS" target="_self"><span class="persName-ANOVAKOV">Novakov</span> and <span class="persName-TNOVAKOV">Novakov</span>, <span class="title-NOVAKOVEYEWITNESS">“Chromatic Effects of Late Nineteenth‐Century London Fog”</span></a>).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Despite the vulnerability of the suburbs, fog was a metropolitan topic in poetry, notably in <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>'s. 
                        While his relationship with <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> was ambivalent, as <span class="persName-">John Clubbe</span> describes it, 
                        <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span> found especially negative, albeit distinctly urban images to describe the fog. 
                        In <span class="title-book-BYRONVISIONOFJUDGMENT"><i>The Vision of Judgement</i></span>(<span class="date-1822">1822</span>), the sun struggles “to dispel / the fogs of <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, through which, dimly beaconed, / 
                        The weathercocks are gilt some thrice a year, / If that the <i>summer</i> is not too severe”. 
                        In <span class="title-poem-BYRONMANFRED"><i>Manfred</i></span> (<span class="date-1817">1817</span>), the songs of the destinies reverse the hopefulness 
                        of <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span>'s sonnet <span class="title-poem-WORDSWORTHWESTMINSTERBRIDGE">“Composed upon Westminster Bridge, <span class="date-1802-09-03">September 3, 1802</span>”</span> (<span class="date-1807">1807</span>), 
                        in which the “beauty of the morning” reveals “Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples” made “bright and glittering in the smokeless air”, 
                        so that “the very houses seem asleep; / And all that mighty heart . . . lying still”; 
                        rather, in the view from the summit of the Jungfrau, “The city lies sleeping; / The morn, to deplore it, / May dawn on it weeping: / Sullenly, slowly, / 
                        The black plague flew o'er it-- / Thousands lie lowly”. 
                        <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span>'s sonnet is mocked again by the prospect of <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>'s plague-cloud in canto 10 of <span class="title-poem-BYRONDONJUAN">Don Juan</span> (<span class="date-1823">1823</span>). 
                        When Juan first sights the city from <span class="placeName-">Shooter's Hill</span>, the narrator describes 
                        “a wilderness of steeples peeping / On tiptoe through their sea coal canopy, / A huge, dun cupola, like a foolscap crown, / 
                        On a fool's head--and there is <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> Town!”
