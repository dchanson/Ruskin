                  <div class="p">A 12 × 18.5 cm, pre‐ruled notebook, covered with greenish marbled boards, half‐bound in chocolate calf, and gilt (the same binding as that described by <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> [Poems (4o, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>), 1:263; Poems (8o, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>), 1:264]). The leaves measure 11 × 17.7 cm.
                    Collation
                    Following and not including the marbled front endpaper: three blank leaves + 167 pp. as numbered by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> (with p. 1 starting on a recto, and with p. 37 given twice) + 3 blank leaves + back marbled endpaper.
                    The three leaves at the beginning and end of the notebook are unruled and, unlike the ruled leaves that make up the main part of the notebook, bear the watermark “Smith & A[(?)] / 18[(?)]”. This difference in papers might suggest a rebinding of <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>, but the worn marbled boards appear original, as do the leather corners. Also, the edges of the paper were marbled in a color that may once have matched the boards. It seems likely, therefore, that <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> has come down to us in the same binding in which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> first used it.
                    <span class="title-manuscript-BATTLEOFWATERLOOMS">Battle of Waterloo: A Play in Two Acts, with Other Small Poems</span>
                    A handmade pamphlet with this title, its pages disassembled, is tipped in at the back of <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>. Originally, the pamphlet formed no part of <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>, and it must not have been inserted when <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> described <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>, as he does not mention it. (See <span class="title-drama-JRBATTLEOFWATERLOOPLAY">“Battle of Waterloo: A Play in Two Acts”</span> for the likelihood that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> was unaware of this pamphlet at all when compiling Poems [<span class="date-1891">1891</span>].)
                        The pamphlet was probably inserted by <span class="persName-AW">Alexander Wedderburn</span>, and no later than <span class="date-1903">1903</span>, since <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood's</span> <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">“Notes on the Original MSS. of Poems”</span>, as elaborated in the Library Edition, adds to the description of <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>: “In this book . . . are now inserted the leaves of a thin paper book” containing <span class="title-drama-JRBATTLEOFWATERLOOPLAY">“Battle of Waterloo: A Play in Two Acts”</span> and other works (<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 2:531). The addition is mentioned also on a leaf tipped in between the marbled front endpapers of <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>; like similar leaves in some of the <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-REDBOOK"></span>Red Books</a>, these hold a clipping from Poems (<span class="date-1891">1891</span>) describing <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>, along with brief remarks penned probably by <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>. It is perplexing why this pamphlet was not included in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>, a collection compiled after <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwoodʼs</span> editing of Poems (<span class="date-1891">1891</span>), just as it is perplexing, and intriguing, why the contents of <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> were omitted from <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span>.
                    The pamphlet requires a description of its own:
                    Most of the booklet’s leaves have been cut at the fold and tipped separately onto successive pages of the notebook. If nothing is lacking—and only a front portion of cover, made of heavier paper, has likely disappeared—the booklet consists of 8 leaves that were folded once to form 16 pp., 10 x 16 cm. The innermost fold, leaves 4–5, remains intact, tending to confirm how the booklet was constructed. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> numbered the pages 1–14, starting with 2r.
                        In addition to this gathering, a back cover remains that is white on the inside, facing p. 16, and bright pink on the outer side, and that looks to be the same age as the other leaves. No matching front cover is extant. Nothing is written on the back cover, but it presumably formed part of the pamphlet when the editors discovered the little anthology; otherwise, they would have had no reason to include it. There is no assurance, however, that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself was responsible for the pink cover, when he constructed the pamphlet in <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, and there is no way of knowing what, if anything, might have been written or drawn on the front cover.</div>

                    Beneath <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin's</span> main title for the anthology, <span class="title-anthology-MISCELLANEOUSPOETRY">“Miscellaneous Poetry,”</span> and above the title of the first poem, <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> wrote,  “By <span class="persName-JR">J. Ruskin</span> from 10 years to 11 to 12 to of age,” with a long space left perhaps to allow for adding <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin's</span> ages as the years went by. As it turned out, the fair-copied poems in the notebook did not extend quite far enough into <span class="date-1832">1832</span> to justify <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> entering age “13” into the space.
                    <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> remarks: “The poems are nearly all dated, and range from June 28, <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, to February <span class="date-1832">1832</span>. The dates are probably those of production, for they are slightly inconsecutive; which would not be the case if they were dates of entry; and, when chronologically arranged, they tally with the order of the first drafts in No. VI” (Poems [4o, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>], 1:263; Poems [8o, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>], 1:264).

                  <div class="p"><span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> is the earliest major manuscript that was originally neither a <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-REDBOOK"></span>Red Book</a> nor a homemade booklet. Another new development that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> starts with <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> is the practice of keeping one notebook for carefully copied presentation of his poetry, while drafting his poems in other notebooks—<span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span> and <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, especially. Some evidence suggests that he took both sorts of notebooks along with him on journeys (see “The Day of Judgement”), entering the fair copies in <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> on Sundays or other days when the family paused from traveling. Just so, the Diary of <span class="date-1830">1830</span> was “written up” from notes during a lengthened stop.
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did compile poetry anthologies prior to <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>, but they were comparatively brief and served to fill out <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-REDBOOK"></span>Red Books</a> whose main feature was the ongoing <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">"Harry and Lucy"</span> narrative: see <span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span> Poetry Anthology, Poetry Descriptive, <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> Second Poetry Anthology, and <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> Poetry Anthology.
                    While no apparent logic governs completion of the anthology other than filling the notebook, it appears from <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin's</span> open-ended record of his son’s age as the boy entered successive fair copies (see Description) that the father at least may have looked for completion on those terms. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, however, left over thirty pages blank at the end of the manuscript (see Contents); and the likeliest explanation for this neglect may be that he was drawn to a grander project—the fair copy in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span> of “Iteriad” and “Athens.” Selections from these epic-length poems appear toward the end of <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>, suggesting that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> grew dissatisfied with their constrained appearance in <span class="title-anthology-MISCELLANEOUSPOETRY">Miscellaneous Poetry</span> and abandoned the anthology for grander presentation in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span>. (Since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not complete fair-copying “Athens” in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span>, however, it is also possible that he returned to <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> to enter 17 stanzas of that poem on a less ambitious scale than that begun in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span>.)
                    On p. 167—a verso, facing the first of the three blank final leaves (see Description)—<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrote in ink, but then erased,  <span class="title-anthology-MISCELLANEOUSPOETRY">MISCELLANEOUS POETRY</span> / HELVELLYN.  This is how the notebook begins on p. 1, so the reason for the erasure is not apparent. Since the erased material is upside down to the text coming from the other direction, perhaps it represents a false start.
