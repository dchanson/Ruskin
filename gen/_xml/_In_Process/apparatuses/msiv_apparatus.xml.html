                  <div class="p">  <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> assigned roman numeral IV to this <span class="title-manuscript-">Red Book</span> in his “<span class="title-bibliography_text-">Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems</span>” for <span class="title-book-">Poems (1891)</span> (Poems [4o, 1891], 1:262; Poems [8o, 1891], 1:263).
                        Two decades earlier, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself had set the precedent for numbering the <span class="title-manuscript-">Red Books</span>, including this one: at bottom of the title page for “<span class="title-poem-">Eudosia</span>,” he wrote “Red book No. 1. <span class="date-1870-08-09">Sept 8th 1870</span>” (see “Eudosia”: Title). On the same day, he docketed <span class="title-manuscript-"> MS III</span> as “Red book No. 2,” and <span class="title-manuscript-">MS I</span> as “Red book No. 3.” For the meaning of this numbering, see Red Books. 
                        Apart from these numerical designations, <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span>ʼs title–intended originally, it appears, both for <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IV</span> in its entirety as well as for its main work—is “<span class="title-poem-">EUDOSIA</span> OR / <span class="title-poem-">A POEM / ON THE / UNIVERSE </span>/ BY <span class="persName-JR">JOHN RUSKIN</span> / VOL I / These are thy glorious works parent of good / Almighty thine this universal frame / Thus wondros fair <span class="persName-FMT">MILTON</span> / BOTANY / HERN HILL / DULWICH.”

                  <div class="p">  <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IV</span> is like some other <span class="title-manuscript-">Red Books</span> (e.g., MS III and MS IIIA) in that it starts with a title page announcing a single work (see Title) but–<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> failing to realize the ambitious length and predominance of that work—the manuscript was left open to being filled by other kinds of writing. <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IV</span>, however, was left with an unusually large blank section: from the page containing the final fair-copied lines of “<span class="title-poem-">Eudosia</span>” 
                        (p. 17) to the Mineralogy Notes [ca. 1829] entered reverso from the other end, <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IV</span> contained a section of 29 leaves, blank except for numbering on some pages, until two decades after its initial use, when <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> used some of those leaves for his catalog of his sonʼs published poems. 
                        Over time, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> put space in other Red Books to various uses–the additional poetry anthologies in <span class="title-manuscript-">MS III</span>, the mineralogy notes in <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IIIA</span> (although that <span class="title-manuscript-">Red Book</span> also retained blank sections extending to significant lengths), the sermon drafts in <span class="title-manuscript-">Juvenilia MS A</span>. That <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> left so much of <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IV</span> unused may suggest that he persisted longer in an intention to carry on with the manuscriptʼs main work,
                        “<span class="title-poem-">Eudosia</span>,” compared to ambitions for “<span class="title-lesson-">Harry and Lucy</span>,” which he relinquished more easily in <span class="title-manuscript-">MS III</span> and <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IIIA</span>. 
                        If so, his lingering ambitions for a long poem would be more expected than for Edgeworthian lessons, which he more quickly outgrew.
                        If <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin </span>had devoted additional Red Books to further “volumes” of “<span class="title-poem-">Eudosia</span>”–beyond the first volume he planned for <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IV</span>, which he gave over to the subject of “Botany”–he presumably would have continued to follow something like the plan found in his source, Lofft, Eudosia. 
                        Since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> subdivides his first volume of his “Poem on the Universe” into “books” (of which he never got beyond the start of book 2), he is even more ambitious than Lofft, whose “Poem on the Universe” is divided only into books (not volumes containing books), of which the first is “The Earth,” corresponding to Ruskinʼs “Botany.”
                        It is possible that one of the fair‐copy versions of “The Constellations: Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and Some of the Southern”–that in <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IA</span>, or <span class="title-manuscript-JRRFT70">RF T70</span>–represents a continuation of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs scheme beyond the first volume in <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IV</span>, as a volume on the stars would correspond to <span class="persName-CL">Lofft</span>ʼs poem: see <a href="/apparatuses/eudosia_apparatus#DISCUSSION" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">“Eudosia”</span>: Discussion</a>.</div>
