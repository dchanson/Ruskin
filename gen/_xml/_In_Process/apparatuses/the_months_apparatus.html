                        Since the Ruskins were traveling on the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span> <span class="date-1835-06-02-1835-12-10">2 June–10 December 1835</span>, the revision was likely completed within five months, by the end of <span class="date-1835-05-01-1835-05-31">May 1835</span>.</div>

                  <div class="p">For the origin of this poem in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs New Yearʼs ode for <span class="date-1835-01-01">1 January 1835</span>, see <span class="title-poem-JRPECKHAMRYE">“As I was walking round by Peckham rye”</span> (<span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>). <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> (and/or the editors) shortened this poem from 17 stanzas to 3—taken from stanzas 12, 13, and 14 of the original draft/fair copy— essentially creating a new poem entirely. Stanzas 1–11 were likely eliminated as more appropriate to private, occasional verse, in which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> addresses <span class="persName-JJR">his father</span> directly and mulls over his personal ambition as a writer and the difficulty of putting life into a “dry” topic.
                        Stanzas 12–14,  in contrast, were more impersonal and cohesive, requiring the least amount of editing and/or restructuring; and as argued respecting the draft, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have composed them from the start with an eye to publication (<span class="title-poem-JRPECKHAMRYE">see “As I was walking round by Peckham rye”</span>: Composition and Publication). <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> maintained the three stanzasʼ structure  with the most notable changes reflected in punctuation and word change.
                        Typically, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> punctuated his draft and fair copy poems sparingly, while punctuation was added to the published stanzas to regulate the grammar of the poem for the public. For example, “Marches maddened winds shall roar” in the draft gains clarity  when edited as “Marchʼs maddenned winds, shall roar”. In Victorian publishing, responsibility for this regularization often fell to the compositor; in this case, however, this task may have been taken by the editor, <span class="persName-WHH">W. H. Harrison</span>, who thus began his long association with the Ruskin family as a copyeditor of <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs writing and liaison with publishers and printers. 
                        Diction was edited for greater elegance and logic, albeit sacrificing some individuality. In the afore‐mentioned line, “bathed by Marches” is changed to “lashed by Marchʼs”. The colorful but awkward “Through all the air the reapers songs are lunging” becomes the more conventionally poetic “The sun‐burnt reaperʼs jocund lays are singing”. Just as the transition from a private audience to a public audience called for elimination of the first eleven stanzas,  the first person pronouns—excessive use of “I” and “myself” throughout the first version—gives way to third person narrative.
                        Again, the mediator of this shift appears to be the standalone piece, “January Suggesting that, at this point in the draft, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was already thinking about a more public piece.

                  <div class="p">As for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs personal life at the time of publication, he was involved in many educational opportunities.
                        <span class="persName-JSD">James S. Dearden</span>ʼs book <span class="title-book-DEARDENRUSKINPICTURES">John Ruskin: A Life in Pictures</span> expands upon a miniature portrait of young <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> by <span class="persName-AECHALON">Alfred Edward Chalon</span> in <span class="date-1836">1836</span>. During this time, he “was attending the <span class="persName-TDREV">Rev. Thomas Dale</span>ʼs lectures on early English literature at Kingʼs College, he was taking watercolour lessons from <span class="persName-CFARTIST">Copley Fielding</span> and drawing lessons from <span class="persName-CR">Charles Runciman</span>” (<span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span> 27). 
                        While tackling all of these tasks, he was preparing to attend Oxford in January of the following year. His mother accompanied him on the trip while his “<span class="persName-JJR">father</span> would remain in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> or travelling the country in connection with his sherry business” (27). <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have omitted the personal sections to his <span class="persName-JJR">father</span> in the poem because he wanted to preserve their connection separate from other influences.
