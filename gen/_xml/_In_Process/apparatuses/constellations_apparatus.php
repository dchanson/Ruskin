                  <div class="p">In the earlier of two surviving fair copies of the poem (see <a href="#MAJORMS">Manuscripts</a>),

                        <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;<span class="caps">THE CONSTELLATIONS</span>&#x201D;</span> above the column of lines. 
                        Then, in what appears an afterthought, he added &#x201C;<span class="caps">NORTHERN</span>&#x201D; to the right in the margin, on the baseline of the main title; 
                        and on a second line below &#x201C;<span class="caps">NORTHERN</span>&#x201D;, he placed, awkwardly, in the margin to the right of the opening lines of the poem, 
                        &#x201C;<span class="caps">SOME OF THE ZODIAC / AND SOME OF THE SOUTHERN</span>&#x201D;.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">While the addition of the trailing lines to the first fair&#x2010;copy subtitle might be explained as pacing <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s composition of the poem&#x2014;that is, 
                        his elaboration of the subtitle as he added constellations from across the hemispheres&#x2014;this 
                        possibility conflicts with the existence of a prior draft. The belated additions could suggest, however, that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> came to understand the hemispheric positions of the constellations only after he first drafted the poem. 
                        As discussed in <a href="#STAGE">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D; as Marking a Stage of Astronomical Education</a>, this inference is probably too extreme&#x2014;contradicted, for example, 
                        by his clustering, more or less, of constellation groups within the poem, such as the northern circumpolar constellations and the <span class="name--ZODIAC">Zodiac</span> constellations. Nonetheless, 
                        the evolving title does testify broadly to <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span> as a marker of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s developing understanding and his desire to represent that development textually and materially. 
                        The revision to the title may also have posed one motive for giving up on this fair&#x2010;copy manuscript, 
                        <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span>, and using the same sheet to revise some of its lines (see <a href="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</a>).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">In the second surviving fair copy, in &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/apparatuses/msiii_apparatus" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> incorporated his revisions to the first fair copy, including 
                        allowing space to center the subtitle properly below the main title and above the first line, breaking the three lines as 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;<span class="caps">THE CONSTELLATIONS / NORTHERN, SOME OF THE ZODIAC AND / SOME OF THE SOUTHERN</span>&#x201D;</span>.</div>

                        lacks a title. Since the (unnumbered) lines in this manuscript start with line 27 as fair&#x2010;copied, 
                        presumably a sheet containing draft of preceding lines has been lost, which may have included a title. The first state of the title, if any, is therefore unknown, 
                        and we can only speculate about its relation to the apparent expansion of the subtitle in the first fair copy.

                     <div class="p">A facsimile of a manuscript&#x2014;the whereabouts of the original being unknown&#x2014;this item consists of two photographs, which document a vertically folded sheet 
                            containing a fair copy of the poem in pen&#x2010;and&#x2010;ink print lettering in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s hand, along with revisions of the text in his cursive hand, both ink and pencil. 
                            The first&#x2010;stage fair copy was annotated in pencil by <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>.
                            Possibly, the photographs were taken in the course of preparing the 
                            &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/library_edition_note" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;; if so, 
                            the facsimile was not cited or reproduced in the edition. The photographs are held by The Ruskin at Lancaster University, 
                            catalogued as &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/apparatuses/rft70_apparatus" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">The folded sheet was photographed spread open and laid flat, with one photograph showing pages 4 and 1 (from left to right), 
                            and the other photograph showing the reverse side, pages 2 and 3 (from left to right). The manuscript reveals at least two major stages of composition, 
                            a first stage of fair copying, and a second stage of heavy revision. The fair copy occupies pages 1&#x2013;2 (i.e., both sides of the first leaf), 
                            while the remaining pages 3&#x2013;4 (the second leaf) would originally have been left blank, prior to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s revisions. 
                            Subsequently, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> used this blank space, as well as the margins of pages 1&#x2013;2, for revisions. 
                            Thus, the facsimiles preserve a rare instance of a manuscript containing a fair copy of an early work by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> that he subsequently revised using the same sheet.</div>

                        Judging by what little the editors wrote about the poem, they based their dating on an association of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span>

                        Their method was sound but their conclusion inexact.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">The physical basis for associating the two poems is the similarity of the fragments of rough draft in a pencil, cursive hand&#x2014;so similar that the two drafts 
                        were apparently mistaken as belonging to the same work (see &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/apparatuses/msia_apparatus#COLLATION" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>: Collation of the Original Manuscript&#x003C;/a&#x003E; and

                        For the place of this draft in the chronological sequence of drafting, revising, and fair&#x2010;copying <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span>, see <a href="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</a>. 
                        Here it suffices to explain that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s hand in these draft manuscripts, which is a sprawling cursive in pencil with occasional substitutions in pen&#x2010;and&#x2010;ink cursive, 
                        cannot be earlier than his first use of pen and ink in <span class="date-1827-04">April 1827</span>; and that the compositional history of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span> 
                        places its <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> draft fragment, which contains lines of book 2 of the poem, no earlier than <span class="date-1827-08">August 1827</span> and possibly starting as late as <span class="date-1827-11">November 1827</span>, 
                        following the family&#x02BC;s return to <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> from the &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/tours_of_1826-27_note" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="date-1827">Tour of 1827</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E; to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>

                  <div class="p">As another physical feature besides the similarity of the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> rough drafts linking <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span> chronologically 
                        with the composition of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span>, the first fair copy of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span> 
                        (<span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span>) shares orthographic eccentricities of punctuation with the fair copy of books 1&#x2013;2 of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span> 
                        (<span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>). For the first twenty lines of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span>, each line ends with punctuation, occasionally a colon or full&#x2010;stop period, 
                        but most frequently a prominent comma formed to look like book print, with a dot and a curl. After twenty lines of this observant punctuation, the marks abruptly stop. 
                        This pattern is identical to the punctuation in the fair copy of book 1 and the first eighty lines of book 2 of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span>, 
                        in which almost every line of verse ends with a punctuation mark until the punctuation gives out altogether. The pattern suggests that 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have added the punctuation to these poems all at once, layering the marks over top of the already fair&#x2010;copied text, only to grow tired of the exercise and quit. 
                        Thereafter, in the fair copies of both poems, only an occasional punctuation mark internal to a verse line appears&#x2014;a comma or an apostrophe, which is regularly spaced along with the surrounding characters, 
                        indicating that the mark was inserted in the course of fair&#x2010;copying. Moreover, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s penmanship for the punctuation is similar in the two poems&#x02BC; fair copies, 
                        with the marks at the ends of lines of verse tending to float above the baseline (see <a href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-COMPARISON">Relation to Fair Copy of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span></a>).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">These practices contrast markedly with the very sparse punctuation in the fragmentary rough drafts of both <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span> 
                        and <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span> in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> and with the fair&#x2010;copied poems comprising the anthology,

                        The poems in the latter collection exhibit, moreover, an awkward learner&#x02BC;s stage of penmanship, including tracing in ink over top of characters formed initially with pencil. 
                        These factors put distance between the <span class="date-1827">1827</span> <span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</span> and the fair copies of 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span> and <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span>, 
                        which in the eccentricity of their punctuation resemble the usage in &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/apparatuses/eudosia_apparatus" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">&#x201C;Eudosia&#x201D;</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;

                        While the significance of that date within the compositional history of <span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">&#x201C;Eudosia&#x201D;</span> is obscure, 
                        the triangulation of that project&#x02BC;s punctuation practices with those of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span> and 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span> appears to situate the latter two projects decisively in <span class="date-1828">1828</span>.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">But when in <span class="date-1828">1828</span>? If <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> based the first lines of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span> on actual observation of the sky 
                        (or perhaps a demonstration at one of the so&#x2010;called Lenten astronomy lectures &#x005B;see &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/astronomy_note" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;Astronomical Education&#x003C;/a&#x003E;), the alignment of planets and constellations described at the beginning of the poem would have been observable

                        (see <a href="COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY">Composition and Publication: First Fair Copy &#x005B;<span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span>&#x005D;</a>); 
                        and by juxtaposing that poem as the first in the anthology with the end of the second volume of <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL2">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> emphasized astronomical learning as a shared interest in both the poem and the prose tale. 
                        In the tale, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span> gives <span class="persName-fictional-LUCY">Lucy</span>

                        Moreover, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> maintained the astronomical theme in the poetry anthology by following <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span> with a fair copy of &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/apparatuses/the_sun_apparatus" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-poem-JRTHESUN">&#x201C;The Sun&#x201D;</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;,

That <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s orthographic and punctuation practices appear to have progressed little by the time he composed and fair&#x2010;copied <span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">&#x201C;Eudosia&#x201D;</span> several months later&#x2014;the same kind of catalog poem on a grandiose scale, 
                        fair&#x2010;copied with the same kind or orthographic eccentricities and even weirder punctuation&#x2014;can be attributed to a long period of family mourning for the death of his aunt. 
                        His father would have been preoccupied at home and in <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>, making arrangements for his sister&#x02BC;s estate and orphaned children.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Remaining open to question is whether composition of the initial draft of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span> could have begun as early as a date in

                        is the possibility&#x2014;admittedly questionable&#x2014;that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> based his opening lines on planetariy observations that were visible in the sky over <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> only during those months,

                        Thus, a genesis of the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> draft commencing, say, in <span class="date-1827-10-1827-12">the fourth quarter of 1827</span> can neither be ruled out nor confirmed.</div>

                        <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span> represent a significant advance, which sprang from learning to use pen and ink in <span class="date-1827-04">April 1827</span> 
                        (see &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/hand_note" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;The Ruskin Family Handwriting&#x003C;/a&#x003E;). For the first time, we see preserved draft containing deletions, substitutions, and insertions, both in pencil and in ink, 
                        most of them in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s hand. At least one of the interventions is in the hand of <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>, 
                        but this is limited to correcting a mistranscription from the preceding draft. <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> proofread; she did not herself revise <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s text, unless she did so verbally. Evidence suggests that she did censor, however, 
                        by marking text she deemed inappropriate in some way. Thus, these states of text open a window onto <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s compositional process as an interaction with his audience, 
                        his parents&#x2014;with his mother acting as proofreader and, to a limited extent, as editor. Perhaps these states of draft and fair copy were preserved for this reason,

                            The latter document&#x2014;the earliest surviving example of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s use of pen and ink&#x2014;is composed almost entirely in cursive using a pencil, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> exchanging the pencil for pen and ink only for the closing of the letter, which he also wrote in cursive. 
                            In the letter, he continued beyond his signature by appending two poems, still using a pen but switching to print lettering. Similarly here, at the end of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span> draft, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> switches from pencil to pen and ink for a closing, &#x201C;I end&#x201D;, written in cursive. 
                            Perhaps he reserved pen and ink for closings in these early cursive manuscripts because the ink suggested to him a sense of finality.</div>

                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> also uses pen and ink for a few minor revisions, making substitutions in ink by striking through pencil draft with a pen and writing the substituted word above. 
                            This usage, too, may have suggested finality to him, an act of polishing the verse. Alternatively or additionally&#x2014;and one suspects this also to have been the case in the <span class="title-letter-jr_to_jjr_1827-05"><span class="date-1827">1827</span> letter</span>&#x2014;<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            felt more at ease manually in dipping a pen to form the strokes of print letters as compared with maintaining the flow of cursive. With respect to penmanship, then, 
                            the constrained use of pen and ink in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIACONSTELLATIONS"><span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;<span class="name--CEPHEUSCONSTELLATION">cepheus</span> and <span class="name--BOOTES">bootes</span> now&#x201D;</span></span> 
                            represents an earlier developmental stage, comparable to the <span class="title-letter-jr_to_jjr_1827-05"><span class="date-1827">1827</span> letter to his father</span>, 
                                whereas the first fair copy, <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span>, shows him using a pen not only for extensive print&#x2010;lettering but also for longer cursive phrases, albeit sometimes over top of the same phrases in pencil, so far as one can tell from the photograph.</div>

                            he wrote &#x201C;end&#x201D; in pencil, cursive; and on the same line, to the left, he wrote &#x201C;I end&#x201D; in ink, also cursive&#x2014;the ink <i>end</i> being presumably the second of the two, 
                            though the order cannot be distinguished from the material evidence. This <i>finis</i> follows <span class="name--CAPRICORNUS">Capricornus (the Sea Goat)</span>, 
                            the last&#x2010;listed of the constellations in all three manuscript versions (line 64 in the second fair copy, <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>): 
                            &#x201C;and the <span class="name--CAPRICORNUS">goat</span> that is formed in the arched sky&#x201C;. 
                            In draft as well as fair copy, this line carries lexical markers of closure&#x2014;for one, by beginning the line uniquely with <i>and</i>, as if to say, 
                            <i>and finally</i>; and for another, by ending the line with a flourish supplied by the quaintly poetic modifier <i>arched</i> (for sources of this poetic diction, see the contextual gloss for <i>arched sky</i> in the witnesses).</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">Another ending is found on the back of the folded sheet (2v), where <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> added nine lines beyond the ending at the foot of the preceding page (2r). 
                            Below these nine addtional lines, on a separate line by itself, he again wrote &#x201C;I end&#x201D; in pencil longhand; 
                            and to the right of that <i>finis</i>, he wrote &#x201C;I end&#x201D; in ink longhand. 
                            (Again, presumably the phrase written in ink was subsequent to the pencil phrase, but the evidence is indeterminate.) 
                            These nine lines form the peroration of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span> as fair&#x2010;copied in <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span>.</div> 
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">As originally concluded, therefore, if the &#x201C;I end&#x201D; on 2r truly indicates an earlier intention,

                            In this respect, the first version of the poem resembles lists of constellations that could be found in print sources on astronomy aimed specifically at children, such as

                            although even <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span>&#x02BC;s lists include implicit commentary in the form of Bible verses 
                                (see &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/astronomy_note#PRINTSOURCES-PRIMERS" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children&#x003C;/a&#x003E;). <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s chief original contribution to such elementary lists consists in his epithets describing some of the constellations he names. 
                            The version of the poem ending with <span class="name--CAPRICORNUS">Capricornus</span> is an aesthetic, poetic exercise more than a religious or scientific one.</div>

                            (lines 29&#x2013;62 of book 2 of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s versification of <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>&#x02BC;s novel, 
                            as fair&#x2010;copied and numbered in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>). 
                            The two poems&#x02BC; drafts resemble one another in the size and kind of paper used for the physical document, and in the sprawling cursive hand used for the pencil draft. 
                            A difference between the manuscripts is that <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;Monastery&#x201D;</span> draft contains no substitutions, 
                                either in pencil or in pen and ink, as does <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span> draft in ink over top of the pencil.
                            (See <a href="#MAJORMS-MSIA">Manuscripts: <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span></a>; at the <span class="placeName-building-BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke Library</span>, 
                                the two manuscripts are now (mistakenly) catalogued together as &#x201C;<span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY"><i>The Monastery</i></span>&#x2014;Manuscript, in an unidentified hand, of passages of verse, undated&#x201D;,

                                The ink cursive hand resembles that used for the revisions of the <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span> version of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span>. The physical evidence thus conforms

                            just as resemblances between the two poems&#x02BC; drafts point to an associated process of composition

                            The treatment of text in books 1&#x2013;2 of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span> as fair&#x2010;copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> has more in common

                            For both <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span>, books 1&#x2013;2, and the first fair copy of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span>, 
                            <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> adopted a comparatively miniscule print&#x2010;lettering, resembling a serif typeface.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">Moreover, in the <span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</span> poems from earlier in <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> avoided punctuation almost entirely, 
                                whereas punctuation does characterize the fair copies of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span> and <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span>, books 1&#x2013;2. 
                                In both, moreover. the punctuation marks share eccentricities suggesting a learner who has an uncertain grasp of the grammatical and rhetorical function of punctuation but who is excited&#x2014;at least initially&#x2014;by 
                            the physical appearance of the marks on the page. Almost every line of books 1&#x2013;2 of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span> is punctuated, 
                                regardless of grammatical or rhetorical need, and the marks are used exclusively at the ends of lines. This obsessive but misinformed observance abruptly ceases at book 2, line 80, of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span>, at the top of page 79 of the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> fair copy. 
                            Just so, the end of every line of the <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span> <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;Constellations&#x201D;</span> fair copy is notched with a punctuation mark until line 20, 
                            where the practice abruptly stops.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">Where used, the punctuation in the opening lines of both fair&#x2010;copied poems often seems arbitrary. While the full&#x2010;stop periods make grammatical sense in most instances, 
                            the commas, colons, and (most prominently in <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span>) an upside&#x2010;down semicolon seem interchangeable with one another in their rhetorical use and placement. 
                            Both these fair copies give the impression that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> layered over the texts 
                            with bookish punctuation to convey the appearance of print, without understanding the grammatical and rhetorical function of the marks. 
                            Finally, in both fair copies, the punctuation markup stops abruptly at an arbitrary place, 
                            suggesting that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> grew tired of the exercise, ran out of time, or was informed about his erroneous usage.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">The oddities of punctuation, then, in both manuscripts should be classed with other attempts to give the fair copy an appearance of print. 
                                The first letters of each line are capitalized, and the first word of line 1 is rendered in all capitals. 
                                As another bookish touch, lines are numbered by fives in the left margin.</div>

                        <div class="p">An especially valuable feature of the <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span> fair copy is the evidence of <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s participation in the compositional process. 
                                At line 54 of the poem, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s handwriting can be unmistakably identified. The intervention is a penciled correction of a mistranscription of a word from the draft text, 
                                substituting the word &#x201C;bear&#x201D; for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s erroneously copied &#x201C;appear&#x201D;. The insertion is accompanied by a penciled deletion of &#x201C;appear&#x201D; using a style of strikethrough that differs from all other instances of strikethrough, save one at line 30

                                From this evidence, one may infer that a series of other pencil marks on the manuscript&#x2014;a diagonal or double diagonal line at the end of each line of verse&#x2014;records 
                                <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s proofreading of the fair copy against the draft manuscript. That these diagonal marks were <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s is substantiated by their replacement by <i>&#x00D7;</i> marks next to certain lines of verse, 
                                which evidently signaled her concerns, prompting revisions by <span class="persName-JR">John</span>. It is possible that the proofreading marks were made by somebody other than <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x2014;<span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, for example&#x2014;but
                                his handwriting does not otherwise appear in the manuscript.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">While we can only infer <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s objections based on the content of the original verse and on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s substitution, 
                                the topics that drew her censorship seem evident enough. An <i>&#x00D7;</i> by the constellation <span class="name--MEDUSACONSTELLATION">Medusa&#x02BC;s Head</span> suggests that the image was deemed too horrible. 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> substituted in the margin a line about the constellation, <span class="name--TELESCOPIUM-HERSCHELII">Herschel&#x02BC;s Telescope</span>, replacing the ancient wonder of <span class="persName-fictional-MEDUSA">Medusa</span>&#x02BC;s stare, 
                                with which the pagan hero <span class="persName-fictional-PERSEUS">Perseus</span> wreaked violence and retribution, with the modern wonder of the seven&#x2010;foot optical instrument, with which the British scientific hero, <span class="persName-WHERSCHEL">William Herschel</span> (<span class="date-1738-1822">1738&#x2013;1822</span>), 
                                discovered the planet <span class="name--URANUS">Uranus</span>. Even the feline violence of the <span class="name--LYNX">&#x201C;furious lynx&#x201D;</span> was tagged to be tamed, replaced by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> with its &#x201C;keen&#x2010;eyed&#x201D; attribute.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">A different kind of horror apparently was suggested by the constellation <span class="name--ARA">Altar</span>, which would have evoked dangerously pagan practices. This line having prompted double <i>&#x00D7;</i>s for revision,

                                and some lines were marked with an <i>&#x00D7;</i> for no obvious reason other than to improve the verse: the trite and redundant epithet &#x201C;pretty&#x201D; was rejected,

                                first writing in cursive with a pencil, and then in some cases writing in cursive with pen and ink to revise the revision over top of the pencil.
                                Insofar as the available evidence shows, then, the revisions were invented by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>; no other hand is present in the draft revision, 
                                although of course we cannot know what discussion, if any, surrounded his decisions. We also cannot know for certain at what point in the fair&#x2010;copying 
                                the process of proofreading and marking for revision began. Since the poem is fair&#x2010;copied through to the end of the extant <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> draft, 
                                it is reasonable to conclude that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> completed the fair&#x2010;copying before it was subjected to scrutiny, although some finishing touches are incomplete: 
                                the marginal line numbering halts after line 60, with fifteen remaining lines left unnumbered; and as already remarked, most punctuation, particularly at the ends of verse lines, 
                                is abandoned after about line 20. Perhaps at this final stage of touch&#x2010;up, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> (or perhaps <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> as well as <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>) 
                                intervened with a review. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may even have been surprised by the demand for revision. The manuscript is unique among the juvenilia 
                                as a fair copy that was subjected to a critique, resulting in revisions made on the fair copy itself.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">It may be no coincidence that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s marginal line&#x2010;numbering was arrested at line 60, since at lines 57&#x2013;60 the most extensive single passage 
                                is flagged for revision, with a long diagonal line and <i>&#x00D7;</i>s marking a quatrain about the constellation <span class="name--LIBRA">Libra (the Scales)</span>, ending in a mention of the <span class="name--MILKYWAY">Milky Way</span>. 
                                The passage may have been flagged merely because the original lines, both in draft and fair copy, are somewhat incoherent: 
                                the lines develop a paradox of the <span class="name--LIBRA">Scales</span> being capable of weighing &#x201C;nothing&#x201D; yet containing a &#x201C;thousand more&#x201D;&#x2014;more even than &#x201C;the beautiful <span class="name--MILKYWAY">milky way</span>&#x201D;&#x2014;but 
                                with the implied object, <i>stars</i>, being absent from the lines. The omission may or may not have been deliberate, 
                                but instead of revising to clarify the paradoxical conceit, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> substituted a couplet that veers to a different topic altogether&#x2014;<span class="name--LIBRA">the Scales</span> as a symbol of justice, 
                                which was a traditional treatment of this constellation, particularly in Roman astronomy (see the contextual gloss hanging from line 57,

                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> began the revision of the <span class="name--LIBRA">Libra</span> quatrain in pencil at the bottom of the inner fold of the pamphlet, 
                                sprawling across the fold to the opposite recto (pp. 3&#x2013;4, which would have been blank at that point), and coninuing onto the back of the pamphlet (p. 4). Nine lines of cursive pencil text wrestle with the topic of justice 
                                (see the textual gloss hanging from lines 57&#x2013;60, ); 
                                and then, at the bottom and top&#x2010;right of the inner fold (pp. 3&#x2013;4), he overwrote this pencil draft with pen and ink, still in cursive, 
                                recasting the lines on <span class="name--LIBRA">Libra</span> as the couplet they became in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> fair copy. 
                                Next, on remaining space in the middle of the inner recto (p. 3), and over top of pencil draft on the back (p. 4), 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drafted in pen and ink new lines on the <span class="name--MILKYWAY">Milky Way</span> as they appear in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> fair copy (lines 65&#x2013;69).
                                In these new lines, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> expanded on the <span class="name--MILKYWAY">Milky Way</span>, previously mentioned only as a comparison with what stars could be weighed in <span class="name--LIBRA">Libra</span>&#x02BC;s scales. 
                                Now he elaborated on the myth of the <span class="name--MILKYWAY">Milky Way</span> as a roadway to heaven for the heroes of mythology. In connection with this image, his revisions reveal that 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrestled, not just with squeamish objections to violent or pagan imagery, 
                                but with broader concepts such as the relation between &#x201C;history&#x201D; (revised to &#x201C;knowledge&#x201D;) and &#x201C;virtue&#x201D;

                        like other poems and prose by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> of <span class="date-1826-1828">1826&#x2013;28</span> that mention the fixed stars 
                        and other astronomical phenomena, was composed in context of popular education in astronomy for adults and children 
                        in the <span class="date-1800-1834"> early nineteenth century</span> in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>. This movement 
                        is surveyed in &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/astronomy_note" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;Astronomical Education&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, and parts of the following discussion are keyed to the context of that broader note.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s purpose in <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span> is more poetic than scientific. 
                        As his most original contribution to the versified catalogue of constellations that constitutes the poem, he assigns descriptive epithets to several of the constellation names. 
                        While the poem is not entirely lacking in the influence of children&#x02BC;s scientific lessons in astronomy, which were typical the period, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> admitted in a note added belatedly in the compositional process&#x2014;the note first appears in the <a href="#COMPPUB-2D-FAIR-COPY">Second Fair Copy</a>&#x2014;that 
                        his arrangement of constellation names is unsystematic with respect to the stars&#x02BC; actual positions in the sky. 
                        The note is less disingenuous than it seems and may play down a significant achievement in spatial imagination 
                        (see <a href="#PROJECT">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D; as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception</a>); 
                        nonetheless, the poem represents an early and playful stage in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s ongoing astromical education 
                        (see <a href="#STAGE">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D; as Marking a Stage of Astronomical Education</a>).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">As a stage of learning, the poem is somewhat elusive in allowing one to gauge the extent of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s knowledge about the constellations and their myths. 
                        He derived some of his epithets, not from mythology, but from fables&#x2014;particularly stories that could apply to constellations representing beasts and birds 
                        (see <a href="#MYTHS">Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology</a>). 
                        Given his mother&#x02BC;s censorship described in <a href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-MR"><span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s Role in the Fair&#x2010;Copying Process</a>, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have avoided expressing some of what he knew about myth. Regrettably, to understand his exposure, the identity of a &#x201C;lesson book&#x201D; on astronomy mentioned in 
                        &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_apparatus" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III&#x201D;</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E; remains conjectural, 
                        but on the evidence of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span> he must have had access to an up&#x2010;to&#x2010;date source 
                        like a recent star atlas, which likely would have relayed legendary as well as scientific information 
                        (see &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/astronomy_note#PRINTSOURCES-ATLASES" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;Astronomical Education: Print Sources of Astronomical Education&#x2014;Star Atlases&#x003C;/a&#x003E;; 
                        and <a href="#MYTHS">Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology</a>). 
                        There has also survived a celestial globe belonging to the family, which is dated ca. 1820, the decade when Ruskin composed "The Constellations", and which was 
                        manufactured by &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/smith_and_son_cartographer_note" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;Smith &#x0026; Son&#x003C;/a&#x003E;

                  <div class="p">In the three diplomatically edited texts of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span>, 
                        contextual glosses attached to each of the constellation names summarize the information commonly available in popular works on astronomy published in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>. 
                        The information includes the position in the sky and the periods of the year when each constellation was visible, if at all, in the night sky above <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>; 
                        the legends, if any, associated with each constellation, especially the more commonly known Greek and Roman myths connected with ancient constellations; 
                        and the origin of comparatively more recent constellations and their significance for British amateur astronomers in the <span class="date-1800-1834">early nineteenth century</span> 
                        (e.g., at this time, the heavens were mapped with a large number of constellations invented between the <span class="date-1500-1799">sixteenth and eighteenth centuries</span>, which became obsolete in the later <span class="date-1800-1999">nineteenth and twentieth centuries</span>; 
                        also, some constellations were typically treated as pairs, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> for some reason separated and named singly in his poem). 
                        Given the uncertainty about <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s sources of information, the glosses survey what <span class="persName-JR">he</span> may have known, not what he necessarily did know or was allowed or encouraged to learn.</div>

                        which pick up where the conversations in <span class="title-lesson-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span> leave off&#x2014;namely, 
                        the astronomy of the constellations both as a discipline of practical and scientific reasoning and as an appreciation of beauty. 
                        This stage of reading consisted at least of volume 2, &#x201C;Of Astronomy&#x201D;, of &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/joyce_jeremiah_note" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-JJ">Jeremiah Joyce</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;&#x02BC;s

                        to spark <span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD">Tommy Merton</span>&#x02BC;s admiration for the beauty and wonder of the fixed stars

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself identifies his use of these latter sources for astronomical education in

                        whereas his reading of the rudimentary dialogues &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-lesson-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E; 
                        is presumptive, based on evidence of his familiarity with this work in

                     <div class="p">It is possible that this first stage of astronomical education, preceding and contemporaneous with the composition of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span>, 
                        also relied on one of the primers in astronomical science written for children in the first third of the century 
                        (see &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/astronomy_note#PRINTSOURCES-PRIMERS" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children&#x003C;/a&#x003E;). 
                        This kind of text was more likely to emphasize memorization rather than dialogic exchange; and primers of the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> for young readers 
                        perhaps more emphatically staked the purpose of astronomical study in religious admiration rather than practical and scientific reasoning. 
                        In its form, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poem embodies the memorization exercises typical of these primers, while its rhetoric reflects no particular agenda of piety&#x2014;at least not initially so. 
                        Arguably, that agenda is layered over the initial version, at the urging of <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s flags for revision 
                        (see <a href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-MR">Margaret Ruskin&#x02BC;s Role in the Fair&#x2010;Copying Process</a> and

                        although such information was also plagiarized from star atlases in the more advanced astronomical primers for young readers,

                        appears more informed and sophisticated than the simple naming in <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span>, 
                        &#x201C;<span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span>&#x02BC;s&#x201D; approach seems flat and pedantic compared to the energy and invention of the earlier poem.

                     <div class="p">As indicated by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s sources, <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span> is a bookish poem. 
                        Even in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s books, however, <span class="persName-TD">Day</span>&#x02BC;s and <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>&#x02BC;s tutors begin study of astronomy by directing their pupils&#x02BC; attention to the evening sky. 
                        To what extent, if any, might <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s composition of his poem have involved actual astronomical observation?</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> opens his poem by hailing <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> and <span class="name--MARS">Mars</span>. 
                        In the instructional dialogues, planets&#x2014;the <i>wandering stars</i>&#x2014;are not an obvious starting point for astronomy lessons in the open air 
                        (see &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/astronomy_note#PRINTSOURCES-DIALOGUES" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;Astronomical Education: Instructional Dialogues on Astronomy&#x003C;/a&#x003E;). Fictional tutors 
                        typically begin by asking pupils to find the most commonly recognizable constellation or <i>fixed stars</i>, <span class="name--CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</span>. As suggested by an earlier poem, 
                        &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/apparatuses/glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-poem-GLENOFGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;)</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had long been able to orient himself to that formation in the night sky. 
                        Nonetheless, equally striking objects for young stargazers are <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span>, the <i>Morning Star</i> and <i>Evening Star</i>, 
                        and <span class="name--MARS">Mars</span>, the red planet. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        may have chosen those planets to begin his poem because they are famously beautiful and striking celestial bodies with familiar mythological associations. In his books, <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> was singled out for the planet&#x02BC;s beauty 
                        (see <a href="#PROJECT">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D; as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception</a>). 
                        It is also possible that the particular alignment described in the poem&#x2014;<span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> and <span class="name--MARSPLANET">Mars</span> visible on the ecliptic, with the constellation <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span> setting on the horizon&#x2014;indicates an actual and datable observation.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">In the poem, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> positions <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> specifically as the Evening Star near the constellation <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span>.

                        <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> would have been visible from <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> as the Evening Star, 
                        setting in the west along with <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span> 
                        during <span class="date-1828-04-1828-06">April&#x2013;June 1828</span>. (During that period,

                        in the constellation <span class="name--CANISMAJOR">Canis Major</span>. It is positioned directly below <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span>.) 
                        During those same months, <span class="name--MARS">Mars</span> would have risen from the east, traveling &#x201C;high . . . &#x005B;in&#x005D; the sky&#x201D;, as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poem says,

                        The digital star chart shows that <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span> set in the late&#x2010;afternoon dusk of <span class="date-1828-04">April 1828</span>, preceded by <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span>; 
                        and as the weeks advanced, <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> set later in the evening than <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span>, which had vanished by sunset. 
                        A comparison of findings using the <span class="title-website-SKYANDTELESCOPE"><i>Sky &#x0026; Telescope Interactive Sky Chart</i></span> with the <span class="title-essay-ASPINCALENDARIUM">Calendarium</span> identifies <span class="date-1828-04">April 1828</span>, therefore, 
                        as the period when the tracks of <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> and <span class="name--MARSPLANET">Mars</span> overlapped with a sighting of <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span>. According to the digital star chart,

                        The poem also names southern constellations that cannot be viewed from the latitude of <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> at all, 
                        but <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s choice of these appears related to a sentiment for their legends. The choice of <span class="name--CRATER">Crater</span> seems arbitrary

                        (lines 7&#x2013;14; see <a href="#TITLE">Title</a>). As possible real sightings, it is striking that he begins with <span class="name--URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major (the Great Bear)</span>, 
                        which likewise tops the list for April in the <span class="title-essay-ASPINCALENDARIUM">&#x201C;Calendarium Stellaris&#x201D;</span>, that constellation being positioned &#x201C;in the zenith&#x201D;.
                        Moreover, the &#x201C;lower star in the tail&#x201D; of the bear &#x201C;at about 65 degrees high&#x201D; is &#x201C;one of those called <span class="name--CHARLESSWAIN"><i>Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</i></span>&#x201D;&#x2014;the next to be identified by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, 
                        albeit not surprisingly. 
                        All six of the following constellations named in the poem were also visible in April, according to the <span class="title-essay-ASPINCALENDARIUM">Calendarium</span>:

                        and that choice was a substitution evidently to placate alarm over <span class="name--MEDUSACONSTELLATION">Medusa&#x02BC;s Head</span> 
                        (see <a href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-MR">Margaret Ruskin&#x02BC;s Role in the Fair&#x2010;Copying Process</a>).</div>

                        forestalled objections by adding a note with a caveat: &#x201C;These constellations though they are next in this poetry are not next in the sky&#x201D;. 
                        The note is not attached by an asterisk to a particular line in the poem, seeming to refer to the whole, 
                        so it is unclear whether he would have exempted the first fourteen lines from observable phenomena.

                        As a list, the poem shares some characteristics with an astronomical primer,

                        by <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span> (<span class="date-1775-1851">1775&#x2013;1851</span>). 
                        While no record of this book or a work like it is recorded in the Ruskin family library, <span class="persName-MSS">Mrs. Sherwood</span> introduces the topic of the constellations 
                        with a heading identical to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s main title, 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span>, 
                        and follows that heading with subdivisions, each with its own heading, that sorts the constellations 
                        into &#x201C;Constellations in the Zodiac or Ecliptic&#x201D;, &#x201C;Constellations to the North of the Ecliptic&#x201D;, 
                        and &#x201C;Constellations to the South of the Ecliptic&#x201D;&#x2014;subdivisions that resemble <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s subtitle to his poem,

                        understanding of the physical laws that govern their motion, and the development of a spatial imagination required to grasp the relation of the earth&#x02BC;s revolutions to the apparent motion of the constellations across the sky. 
                        In each of her hemispheric categories, <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span> 
                        merely lists the names of constellations&#x2014;the Latin name followed by its English translation&#x2014;which 
                        matches <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s procedure in his catalogue poem, except for his added embellishment of a poetic epithet to describe some of the constellations. 
                        <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span> provides no information about each of the constellations; rather, she annotates the respective lists with a Bible verse 
                        that mentions the stars and praises the <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">Creator</span>.</div>

Unlike <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span>&#x02BC;s lists of names, however, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s catalogue is not encased within Scripture quotations that monitor the aim of memorization with expressions of piety. 
                        Rather, the compositional history suggests that moral and Christian (but not specifically Scriptural) admonition was layered onto the poem to contain the paganism presented by its list of names.

                       in spatial perception and translating that perception into a graphic representation. 
                       In <span class="title-book-DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><i>The History of Sandford and Merton</i></span>, 
                       <span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD">Tommy Merton</span> proposes to <span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</span> 
                       to memorize the positions of the stars forming the constellations by &#x201C;&#x2018;mak&#x005B;ing&#x005D; a mark upon . . . paper for every star 
                       in <span class="name--CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC; Wain</span>; 
                       and I would place the marks just as I see the stars placed in the sky; and I would entreat you to write the names for me, 
                       and this I would do till I was acquainted with all the stars in the heavens&#x2019;&#x201D;. <span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</span> applauds the project 
                       but points out that paper is flat, whereas the sky, as <span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD">Tommy</span> says, 
                       &#x201C;&#x2018;seems to rise from the earth on every side like the dome of a great church&#x2019;&#x201D;. 
                       &#x201C;&#x2018;Then if you were to have some round body&#x2019;&#x201D;, <span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</span> suggests, 
                       &#x201C;&#x2018;I should think it would correspond to the different parts of the sky, and you might place your stars with more exactness&#x2019;&#x201D;. 
                       The tutor accordingly supplies <span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD">Tommy</span> with a paper&#x2010;covered ball, 
                       enabling him to devise his own celestial globe based on his own observations of the constellations, remarking both the constellations&#x02BC; relative positions 
                       and their nightly movements in the sky. Starting by drawing his &#x201C;favourite constellation of <span class="name--CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</span>&#x201D;, 
                       <span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD">Tommy</span> next marks the constellation situated on the opposite side of the Pole&#x2010;star,

                       and then he is captured by the &#x201C;grandeur and beauty&#x201D; of the &#x201C;glorious constellation&#x201D; <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span>, 
                       which &#x201C;he could not help observing . . . by intervals, all the evening&#x201D; as &#x201C;it seemed to pass on, in a right line drawn from east to west&#x201D;

                       This is the practical recommendation by <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYTD">Harry Sandford</span>, the farmer&#x02BC;s boy, for how to find one&#x02BC;s way when lost on a dark night. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, in lines 7&#x2013;11, does name a cluster of circumpolar constellations,

                        on beauty rather than pragmatism, by beginning the poem with &#x201C;stars&#x201D; traditionally regarded as the most beautiful&#x2014;<span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span>, the so&#x2010;called Morning Star and Evening Star,

                        &#x201C;a glorious sight for all sky loving men&#x201D;. Even for <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>&#x02BC;s drier <span class="persName-fictional-TUTORJJ">Tutor</span>, <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> is &#x201C;by far the most beautiful of . . . all&#x201D; planets, prompting a quotation from <span class="persName-JMILTON">Milton</span> praising the Evening and Morning Star;

                        From this glittering horizon, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poem leads the eye aloft along the ecliptic to <span class="name--MARS">Mars</span>, &#x201C;high / On his throne&#x201D;

                       the constellation names inscribe a formal pattern on a star map that reads as a spherical shape plotted on a flat plane. As mentioned 
                       at the start of this Discussion, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did own a celestial globe. 
                       Print sources were also available to him that contained examples of planispheres, such as <span class="persName-AJ">Jamieson</span>&#x02BC;s 
                       <span class="title-artwork-JAMIESONCELESTIALATLASPL1">&#x201C;Stereographic Projection of the Northern Celestial Hemisphere on the Plane of the Equinoctial&#x201D; 
                           (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-lesson-JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><i>Celestial Atlas</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, pl. 1)</span>. 
                       <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poem can be read as reversing <span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</span>&#x02BC;s suggestion, 
                       by flattening a celestial globe or dome of the sky on paper in the manner of a &#x201C;stereographic projection&#x201D;. 
                       The eye of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s speaker inscribes a series of arcs, first by anchoring a &#x201C;glorious sight&#x201D;: &#x201C;there&#x201D; is <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> &#x201C;in the evening air&#x201D;, 
                       with <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span> &#x201C;beside it&#x201D;. Then, having anchored <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> and <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span> on a horizontal plane, 
                       the speaker raises the eye &#x201C;high&#x201D; to <span class="name--MARSPLANET">Mars</span>, thus forming an arc. 
                       <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> anchors an on the horizon and inscribes a spatial arc upward in the sky. 
                       As the poem goes on to name the constellations, a spatial pattern emerges of repeated anchoring and arcing, tracing a verbal planisphere.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">The sequence begins with the northern circumpolar constellations (lines 7&#x2013;11), as do the printed scientific dialogues. 
                       In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s sources, the dialogues typically identify only a few of these constellations&#x2014;<span class="name--CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</span> inside of <span class="name--URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major</span>, 
                       its pointer stars leading the eye to the <span class="name--POLARIS">Pole Star</span>, which forms the tip of <span class="name--URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor</span>&#x02BC;s tail. 
                       In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poem, the circumpolar constellations serve repeatedly as an anchor to which the sequence returns at fairly regular intervals: 
                       <span class="name--CHARLESSHEART">Cor Caroli</span> (Charles&#x02BC;s Heart, line 13), <span class="name--URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor</span> (Little Bear, line 18), 
                       <span class="name--CEPHEUS">Cepheus</span> and <span class="name--BOOTES">Bootes</span> (line 27), <span class="name--LYNX">Lynx</span> (line 30), and <span class="name--CAMELOPARDALIS">Cameleopardalis</span> (line 33). 
                       In between these returns to the center, the poem arcs outward by naming constellations on the periphery of the planisphere. 
                       This oscillating pattern begins by naming <span class="name--CYGNUS">Cygnus</span> (the Swan, line 12), which, 
                       viewed from <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, skirts the north&#x2010;northeast horizon (i.e., at 9:00 P.M. in the evening, to adopt <span class="persName-JASPIN">Aspin</span>&#x02BC;s standard, and choosing the <span class="date-1828-01-1828-04">first quarter of 1828</span> for observation). 
                       From <span class="name--CYGNUS">Cygnus</span>, the poem&#x02BC;s next&#x2010;named constellation (<span class="name--CHARLESSHEART">Cor Caroli</span>) returns the viewer to the center, only to be directed back to the periphery with <span class="name--MEDUSACONSTELLATION">Caput Medusae</span> (Medusa&#x02BC;s Head, line 14, as originally drafted and fair&#x2010;copied), 
                       which lies on the north&#x2010;northwest horizon. This time, before returning to the center, the next named constellation circles the viewer back to the northeast horizon near <span class="name--CYGNUS">Cygnus</span>, 
                       by calling out <span class="name--EQUULEUS">Equuleus</span> (Little Horse), <span class="name--ANSER">Anser</span> (Goose), and <span class="name--LYRA">Lyra</span> (Lyre) (lines 15&#x2013;17). Then back to the center (<span class="name--URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor</span>), only to rebound to the <span class="name--CYGNUS">Cygnus</span> group in the northeast by naming <span class="name--VULPECULA">Vulpecula</span> (the Fox, line 19; see plates 14&#x2013;15 of <span class="name--URANIASMIRROR"><i>Urania&#x02BC;s Mirror</i></span>, which picture all these constellations). 
                       The pattern is comparable to placing one&#x02BC;s thumb on the polar north of a celestial globe, or on the center&#x2010;point of a planisphere map of the northern hemisphere, 
                       and extending one&#x02BC;s fingers first toward the quadrant containing <span class="name--CYGNUS">Cygnus</span>, and then rotating toward the quadrant containing <span class="name--PERSEUSCONSTELLATION">Perseus et Caput Medusae</span>, and then back again.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">Having established this sideways rotation, at line 20 the poem plunges into the southern hemisphere, casting a meridian arc from North Pole to South Pole. 
                       Thus, a circle becomes a sphere. Naming the &#x201C;blessed cross&#x201D;, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> forms a latitudinal vector that can point simultaneously north and south, 
                       since the name <i>cross</i> can refer either to <span class="name--CYGNUS">Cygnus</span>, which is also known as the Northern Cross, 
                       or to <span class="name--CRUX">Crux</span>, the Southern Cross. To confirm the southern direction, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> next names <span class="name--ROBURCAROLINUM">Robur Carolinum</span> (Charles&#x02BC;s Oak, line 21), which is nearly adjacent to <span class="name--CRUX">Crux</span>. 
                       Then, sending a latitudinal line back up the sphere, the sequence passes through <span class="name--CRATER">Crater</span> (the Cup, line 22)&#x2014;a 
                       southern constellation that, unlike <span class="name--CRUX">Crux</span> and <span class="name--ROBURCAROLINUM">Robur Carolinum</span>, lies far enough north to be visible from <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> on the southwest horizon. 
                       Continuing north, the poem lands on <span class="name--HERCULESCONSTELLATION">Hercules</span> and <span class="name--CERBERUSCONSTELLATION">Cerberus</span> (lines 23&#x2013;24), near the northern pole. 
                       Having inscribed this latitudinal circle, the poem returns to the longitudinal circle by again naming constellations in the <span class="name--CYGNUS">Cygnus</span> group&#x2014;<span class="name--LACERTA">Lacerta</span> (the Lizard, line 25), 
                       and <span class="name--AQUILACONSTELLATION">Aquila</span> (the Eagle, line 26). Finally, the poem regains the northern pole by naming <span class="name--CEPHEUSCONSTELLATION">Cepheus</span>, the King, and <span class="name--BOOTES">Bootes</span>, the Huntsman, (line 27), 
                       constellations that are balanced on nearly opposite sides of the pole. And then the poem loops to the South Pole again, 
                       naming <span class="name--APUS">Apus</span> (Bird of Paradise, line 28, Anglicized as the English &#x201C;Hirundo&#x201D; or Swallow, in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s translation).</div>

                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> also lends an English inflection to constellation names where possible: for example, <span class="name--APUS">Apus</span> is not the tropical Bird of Paradise 
                            but the northern Swallow; <span class="name--LEO">Leo</span> is not the fierce <span class="name--NEMEANLION">Nemean Lion</span> but the &#x201C;generous&#x201D; and therefore, one supposes, British kingly beast 
                            (see the contextual glosses for these constellations; see also &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/astronomy_note#PRINTSOURCES-PRIMERS" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children&#x003C;/a&#x003E;).</div>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">British pride in the nation&#x02BC;s standing in astronomy was aroused by competition with the French. 
                        The French astronomer, <span class="persName-NLL">Nicolas&#x2010;Louis de Lacaille</span> (<span class="date-1713-1762">1713&#x2013;62</span>), who mapped the stars in the southern hemisphere 
                        from the vantage of the <span class="placeName-CAPEOFGOODHOPE">Cape of Good Hope</span> in <span class="placeName-SAFRICA">south Africa</span>, took aim at <span class="placeName-ROBURCAROLINUM">Robur Carolinum</span>, which honored <span class="persName-KC2">Charles II</span> of <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>. 
                        As <span class="persName-NLL">Lacaille</span> created numerous new constellations of his own in the southern hemisphere, he eliminated the British honorific constellation, 
                        criticizing its inventor, the English astronomer <span class="persName-EHALLEY">Edmond Halley</span> (<span class="date-1656-1742">1656&#x2013;1742</span>), for an illogical redistribution of stars originally 
                        belonging to the ancient southern constellation, <span class="name--ARGONAVIS">Argo Navis</span> (the Ship of the Argonauts). 
                        Restoring <span class="name--ROBURCAROLINUM">Robur</span>&#x02BC;s stars to the ship&#x02BC;s prow, <span class="persName-NLL">Lacaille</span> justified uprooting <span class="name--ROBURCAROLINUM">Robur</span> on ostensibly scientific grounds, 
                        given that new constellations typically were formed from &#x201C;unformed&#x201D; stars&#x2014;that is, stars ignored by <span class="persName-PTOLEMY">Ptolemy</span> in plotting the ancient constellations&#x2014;rather 
                        than by robbing old constellations of their stars for new configurations. In designing his own new constellations, 
                        <span class="persName-NLL">Lacaille</span> was inspired by an Enlightenment principle of honoring the modern arts and sciences rather than paying tribute to individual monarchs. 
                        Historians suspect <span class="persName-LACAILLE">Lacaille</span>, however, of a prejudicial view when targeting specifically a British honorific constellation, 
                        while inconsistently retaining constellations that paid tribute to other nations&#x02BC; rulers 
                        (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#BARENTINELOSTCONSTELLATIONS" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-JCBARENTINE">Barentine</span>, <span class="title-book-BARENTINELOSTCONSTELLATIONS"><i>Lost Constellations</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 352&#x2013;54). 
                        The rivalry persisted in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s time, when an <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> British astronomy manual bitterly mocked an attempt 
                        to rename a portion of the constellation <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span> after <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span>

                        was in the news when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was composing <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201C;</span>

                     <div class="p">As shown by the revision of the fair copy in RF T70, even this caveat did not suffice. In this peroration, 
                        Ruskin struck out "history" and substituted "knowledge", thus extending the sway of "virtue" over a potentially broader scope of ways of knowing. 
                        Objectionable knowledge in this poem took two forms, as suggested by the lines that his mother flagged for revision and Ruskin's consequent revisions: 
                        evocations of horror or violence, and examples of paganism that approached blasphemy from a Christian perspective 
                        (see <a href="COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-MR">Margaret Ruskin&#x02BC;s Role in the Fair&#x2010;Copying Process</a>).</div>

                        of approaches. In <span class="title-book-SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><i>Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children</i></span>, 
                        <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span> cannot avoid the pagan, mythical names of the constellations, but she avoids alluding to the myths themselves, 
                        defining the constellations neutrally as &#x201C;remarkable groups or clusters of stars, to which names of various figures have been given&#x201D;. 
                        She does not pursue the identity of the figures or their stories, presumably fearing that a fascination with the myths approaches idolatry, 
                        as suggested by a quotation she delivers from <span class="title-scripture-CHRONICLES">Chronicles</span>: 
                        &#x201C;For great is the <span class="persName-scriptural-CREATOR">Lord</span>, and greatly to be praised:

                        (<span class="title-scripture-1CHRONICLES">1 Chron 16</span>: 25&#x2013;26). Instead, <span class="persName-MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</span> 
                        directs admiration of the stars toward Christian praise: &#x201C;We find in Scripture the glory of the righteous in the resurrection compared to that of the stars; 
                        by which comparison we find, that their splendour will partake of that of the Son of God himselfȁ

                        treating the mythic origins of the constellations as useful knowledge: &#x201C;The names and figures are of very ancient date, 
                        and are still retained for the sake of distinction, as well as to avoid confusion in comparing ancient with modern observations&#x201D;

                        This functional justification does not prevent <span class="persName-JASPIN">Aspin</span> from summarizing the &#x201C;fables&#x201D; associated with each of the constellations&#x2014;summaries keyed to the cards depicting the mythical figures, 
                        which are collected in <span class="name--URANIASMIRROR"><i>Urania&#x02BC;s Mirror</i></span>. 
                        <span class="persName-JASPIN">Aspin</span> reconciles the pagan tales with Christian revelaton by occasionally interpreting 
                        the mythical figures as biblical types (in the contextual glosses on the poem, see Aspin's commentary, e.g., on 
                        , 
                        , and 
                        ).</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">Jacob Green, Aspin's American competitor for the market in illustrated guides to the mythology of the constellations, 
                        and Alexander Jamieson, whose illustrations in the Celestial Atlas were plagiarized by the artists for both Green's Astronomical Recreations and 
                        for Urania's Mirror, were given to jousting with more specific theological controversies surrounding astronomical lore. 
                        Green fumed, for example, over the controversy surrounding the Zodiac of Dendera--an Egyptian stone antiquity representating the zodiac, 
                        which was purloined by French agents during the Napoleonic era and believed by some savants to predate the generations of Noah by thousands of years. 
                        Contradicting the biblical narrative, the Zodiac of Dendera appeared to present an alignment of equinoxes with constellations that the artifact's creators 
                        could have witnessed only in an ancient sky from long before the Flood, as proven by calculations based on the precession of the earth's poles. 
                        This controversy, which provoked a surprising investment of scientific, philologial, theological, and political attention 
                        (see Buchwald and Josefowicz, The Zodiac of Paris), 
                        was countered dismissively by Green with an appeal to the popular theological lectures of Thomas Chalmers 
                        (see the contextual gloss on ). 
                        While Green's appeal is complacent and reactionary, Chalmers's blending of natural theology and Scottish evangelicalism 
                        probably reflected the standing of Ruskin's parents on questions of conflict between science and biblical authority. 
                        The family library included a copy of <span class="persName-TCHALMERS">Chalmers</span>'s <span class="title-book-CHALMERSASTRONOMICAL"><i>Discourses on the Christian Revelation Viewed in Connection with the Modern Astronomy</i></span> (<span class="date-1817">1817</span>), 
                        which sought to refute skeptical arguments that the evidence of astronomy undermines the truth of Christian revelation

                     <div class="p">Within this range of solutions to reconciling secular astronomical learning with the sacred, Ruskin is unequal to the third approach--an engagement 
                        with the varieties of natural theology, which attempt a dialogue between science and faith--but he combines the other two approaches in the conclusion 
                        to "The Constellations". First, in his declaration that "history" or "knowledge" is less "bright" than "virtue", he effectively adopts Mrs. Sherwood's strategy 
                        of bluntly subordinating astronomical facts to Bible quotations. Comparing their treatments of the planet Mercury, 
                        which Ruskin likens to virtue, one finds Mrs. Sherwood's information about that planet dominated by a quotation from Acts. 
                        Paul and Barnabas, while preaching in the Roman colony of Lycaonia, are horrified to be confused by their audience with pagan gods, Mercury (Hermes) and Jupiter (Zeus). 
                        Amazed that Paul successfully commanded a cripple to walk, the Lycaonians "lifted up their voices, saying . . . 
                        'The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!'". The point of the episode is to condemn as idolatrous 
                        any knowledge other than the apostles' witness. In Mrs. Sherwood's transcription:</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="floating-text">

                           <div class="p">And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker. 
                                    Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, 
                                    and would have done sacrifice with the people. Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, 
                                    heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? 
                                    We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you, that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God,

                        this passage of scripture along with a few facts about the planet (see

                        No application of the scripture is invited or necessary, since the message is flattened to the solitary implication that any learning is idolatrous that fails to lead to praise of the Creator.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">Ruskin's comparison of "beauteous" Mercury with virtue entails an additional level of interpretation, however, 
                        since his choice of Mercury implies a typological reading based on knowledge that Mrs. Sherwood prohibits--the 
                        myths of Hermes. Even the story from Acts requires such knowledge to explain why the Lycaonians believed Paul to be Hermes, given that 
                        "he was the chief speaker". Ruskin may have found an explanation in a reference work on Greek and Roman mythology known to have existed in the family library, 
                        and probably acquired in the 1820s when he composed "The Constellations":

                        Here, Ruskin would have found pleasure in the attributes of the god of eloquence:</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="floating-text">

                           <div class="p">&#x005B;Mercury&#x005D; "is said to be the inventor of letters; and his Greek name, Hermes, 
                                    is derived from a word in that language which signifies "to interpret" or "explain": 
                                    in this quality Mercury is the God of eloquence, as Apollo is the God of poetry: 
                                    an ingenious writer of the present age (John Horne Tooke, in his Diversions of Purley) 
                                    has considered the wings which this God annexes to his feet, as emblematical of the wings 
                                    which language gives to the thoughts of men.</div>

                     <div class="p">While this extended gloss identifies Mercury with oratory, Ruskin's more surprising association of the deity with virtue 
                        requires examining the effects of eloquence. To make this case, The Pantheon is a compelling source, 
                        since Godwin disassociates Mercury from the evil uses of rhetoric, just as he exonerates the god from dishonest uses of buying and selling, 
                        in his role as "inventor of traffic, . . . said to have introduced the use of weights, measures, and contracts". 
                        In an exception that John James Ruskin would perhaps have appreciated, Godwin argues that "licentiousness" in 
                        the "Greek imagination" led them to have "indecorously represented Mercury as the God of thieves", 
                        since a failing lies in human nature and in the system of traffic itself, which is "too apt to degenerate into a system of fraud": 
                        "&#x005B;W&#x005D;hen men engage in buying and selling and barter as a profession, the more keen and grasping among them will endeavour to buy cheap and sell dear, 
                        and cozen and overreach those with whom they have any dealings" 
                        (Baldwin &#x005B;pseud. Godwin&#x005D;, The Pantheon, 58).</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="p">Thus, whereas Mrs. Sherwood's exercise sets up a hierarchy of whole categories of knowledge, Godwin's approach undertakes to educate 
                        the child reader's own imagination, which he engages by humanizing the sacred: 
                        "There are many things related of this God, which forcibly suggest to us the idea of a man, 
                        who for his great and essential services to his fellow-beings, was worshipped as a divinity after his death". 
                        Mercury wields magical powers by virtue of his <i>caduceus</i>--the winged wand coiled by two serpents, which he carries--but

                                    but embedded in a peroration on the infinitude of the universe: &#x201C;. . . how in adequate must the utmost stretch of finite faculties be to represent infinity! 
                                    The stars, disposed in constellations, and surrounded by concentric circles, may perhaps assist the imagination a little: 
                                    The attempt in the <span class="title-lesson-WALKERLASTSCENE">LAST SCENE</span>, if not admired, we hope will be forgiven. But was it possible we could actually take our flight 
                                    into infinite space, or be borne on the wings of lightning, to the most distant fixed Star we can now see, even there, 
                                    perhaps we should find ourselves on the confines of creation, and see as many stars before us as we left behind! 
                                    For space has neither top nor bottom in it; it is a circle whose centre is every where, but whose circumference is no where!&#x201D; (pp. 36&#x2013;37).</li>

                                which by <span class="date-1828">1828</span> had passed into the management of <span class="persName-DFW">Deane Franklin Walker</span> (<span class="date-1778-1865">1778&#x2013;1865</span> &#x005B;&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#HUANGURANIA" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-H-FHUANG">Huang</span>, <span class="title-essay-HUANGURANIA">&#x201C;When Urania Meets Terpsichore&#x201D;</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 50&#x005D;), 
                                the most comprehensive view of the constellations was presented as the finale. Could <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> have conceived of his poem 
                                as an ekphrastic version of this final, totalizing scene? Apparently, in this show, a transparency 
                                exhibited a circle of the starry night, surrounded by concentric rings to suggest infinitude. 
                                In an engraving by <span class="persName-ISTOW">I. Stow</span> (ca. <span class="date-1770-1823">1770&#x2013;1823</span>), after <span class="persName-EBURNEY">E. F.

                                Scene 1 represented the earth and sun by turning the orbit vertically to the audience, enclosing this revolution of the Eidouranion within a projection of an outer ring, which showed the <span class="name--ZODIAC">Zodiac</span> constellations. 
                                The <span class="name--ZODIAC">Zodiac</span> constellations were represented by their respective mythological figures. 
                                Perhaps the transparency for the Last Scene exhibited a similar ring of constellations in their mythological guise,
                                which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in his way has reproduced.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">The beginning of the poem, however, starts with a version of Scene 1 in the Walkers&#x02BC; exhibition&#x2014;or more precisely, a portion of their Scene 4&#x2014;with 
                                the rising and setting of <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> and <span class="name--MARS">Mars</span>. As noted earlier, the poem is atypical of <span class="persName-TD">Day</span>&#x02BC;s and <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>&#x02BC;s 
                                introductions to the constellations, which begin with finding the circumpolar constellations in the sky. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                                incorporates that observation as the second stage of his poem. The <span class="name--ZODIAC">Zodiac</span> constellations form a distinct piece within the poem. 
                                The most significant point to draw from the context of the Lenten astronomy lectures is that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s catalogue 
                                may have attempted a sublime totality, an expression of religious awe.</div>
