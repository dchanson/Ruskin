                  <div class="p">What the speaker “looks at” when looking at the ship constitutes, in part, an observation about the apparent size of objects in relation to their distance. 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drew this observation from a lesson in <span class="title-book-DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><i>The History of Sandford and Merton</i></span> by <span class="persName-TD">Thomas Day</span>, 
                        in which the tutor, <span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</span>, instructs <span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD">Tommy Merton</span> to work out the relation of apparent size to distance 
                        by looking at ships at sea from than vantage of the shore. <span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD">Tommy</span> needs the lesson, having revealed the dependency of his thinking on appearances—his 
                        assumption that the stars revolve, rather than the earth in relation to them; and that the stars must be smaller than the sun, 
                        given their relative appearance in the sky. <span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</span> takes advantage of a walk by the sea to correct <span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD">Tommy</span>ʼs assumptions. 
                        Lexical borrowings from this passage in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem prove that he based his poem on this passage.</div>

                        <div class="p">they continued their excursion over the hills, till at last they came in sight of the sea.—As 
                            they were diverting themselves with the immense prospect of water that was before them, 
                            <span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</span> perceived something floating at a distance, so small as to be scarcely discernible by the eye. 
                            He pointed it out to <span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD">Tommy</span>, who with some difficulty was able to distinguish it, and asked him what he thought it was?</div>
                        
                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD">Tommy</span> answered that he imagined it to be some little fishing boat; but could not well tell, on account of the distance.</div>
                        
                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD"><i>Mr. Barlow</i></span>. If you do not then see a ship, what is it you do see, or what does that object appear to your eyes?</div>
                        
                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD"><i>Tommy</i></span>. All that I can see is no more than a little dusky speck, which seems to grow bigger and bigger.</div>
                        
                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD"><i>Mr. Barlow</i></span>. And what is the reason it grows bigger and bigger?</div>
                        
                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD"><i>Tommy</i></span>. Because it comes nearer and nearer to me.</div> 
                        
                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD"><i>Mr. Barlow</i></span>. What, then, does the same thing sometimes appear small, and sometimes great?</div>
                        
                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD"><i>Tommy</i></span>. Yes, sir, it seems small when it is at a great distance; for I have observed even houses and churches, 
                            when you are at some miles distant, seem to the eye very small indeed: and now I observe that the vessel is sailing towards us, 
                            and it is not, as I imagined, a little fishing boat, but a ship with a mast; for I begin to distinguish the sails.</div>
                        
                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</span> walked on a little while by the side of the sea; and presently <span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD">Tommy</span> called out again: 
                            ‘I protest, I was mistaken again; for it is not a vessel with one mast, as I thought a little while ago, 
                            but a fine large ship, with three great masts, and all her sails before the wind. 
                            I believe she must either be a large merchant‐man or else a frigate.’</div>
                        
                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD"><i>Mr. Barlow</i></span>. Will you then take notice of what you have now been saying? What was first only a little dusky speck 
                            became a vessel with one mast; and now this vessel with one mast plainly appears a ship of a very large size, 
                            with all her masts, and sails, and rigging complete. Yet all these three appearances are only the same object, 
                            at different distances from your eye.</div>
                        
                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-fictional-TOMMYTD"><i>Tommy</i></span>. Yes, sir; that is all very true indeed.</div>
                        
                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-fictional-BARLOWTD"><i>Mr. Barlow</i></span>. Why, then, if the ship, which is now full in sight, were to tack about again, and sail away from us 
                            as fast as she approached just now; what do you think would happen?</div>
                        
                        <div class="p"><span class="persName-fictional-"><i>Tommy</i></span>. It would grow less and less every minute till it appeared a speck again.</div>
