                            Yesterday in rummaging about my library I was happy to come upon a folder of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscripts which I knew had escaped destruction,

                        The manuscripts originally collected in the binding are miscellaneous, suggesting that the editors gathered togetehr odds and ends, and numbered and inserted the resulting collection

                  <div class="p">Perhaps the folio was disassembled from its binding as a consequence of damage from <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>&#x02BC;s fire, 
                        but in his letter to <span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span> (see <a href="#PROVENANCE">Provenance</a>), 
                        <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> refers to a &#x201C;folder of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscripts&#x201D; 
                        rather than to a bound item, suggesting that the dealer may have removed the binding prior to the fire. Given his 
                        interest in the very early manuscripts in the collection, two of which he initially held back from Yale, 
                        perhaps <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> considered keeping those manuscripts for himself or dealing with them separately from the other manuscripts in his keeping. 
                        Of course, <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> could not have retained two poems, and sent the others separately, unless he had already removed the binding, whether before or after the fire. 
                        Certainly, the items forming <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> were loose when delivered to Yale University Library as (or among) &#x201C;31 sheets of poems&#x201D;

                            It is unclear what <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s column of numbered  sheets  refers to, or why his enumeration omits 4, 21&#x2013;23, and 27, since the numbers cannot be reconciled with consistent features of the individual manuscripts. Nor can <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s numbers, even subtracting the skipped numbers, be reconciled with <span class="title-catalogue-SOTHEBYCAT1931">Sotheby &#x0026; Co., Catalogue of Manuscripts and Library (<span class="date-1931">1931</span>)</span>, which describes <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> as containing &#x201C;24 pp&#x201D;. One possibility is that <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> was counting sheets on which items were mounted. For example, &#x201C;Come on good horse&#x201D; (part of <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span>), mentioned in <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>&#x02BC;s letter to <span class="persName-CBT">Tinker</span>, is pasted onto a sheet with a watermark partially visible, &#x201C;&#x005B;. . .&#x005D;ETOWGOOD FINE&#x201D;, the same watermark found in the paper on which <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations: Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and Some of the Southern&#x201D;</span> is mounted (see Content, a; and Content, b). These papers cannot be proven to have belonged to <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> as originally bound, since <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s title and contents pages are written on quite different paper, watermarked &#x201C;Judicature Foolscap&#x201D;. However, this style of mounting is common in the older collections of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscripts, as in <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span>, in which the early small poetry pamphlets are mounted onto larger sheets, which are in turn bound together. Further connecting the mounting sheets for <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span> and <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations: Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and Some of the Southern&#x201D;</span> with the original <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>, these papers show evidence of slight charring. It is reasonable to conclude, then, that <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s column of numbers refers to mounting sheets but possibly only for the smaller items; in <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span>, for example, larger items were not mounted on sheets but attached directly to binding stubs.
                            Other possible discrepancies arise in comparing <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents with the contents of <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> as listed in the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>. <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations: Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and Some of the Southern&#x201D;</span>, listed in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:530, is omitted from <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents, unless this item is comprised among very early MSS.  (see below, Content). <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table also fails to mention  <span class="title-poem-JRCRYSTALHUNTER">The Crystal Hunter</span>  (no. 188), mentioned in the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span> list, unless <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> meant to include this ode under the entry  <span class="title-poem-JRTOHISFATHER">To his father. Birthday ode</span> <span class="date-1834">1834</span>.  Otherwise, the two lists of contents match, the one in <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span> being ordered according to what <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> judged (partly erroneously) to be the items&#x02BC; dates.
                            Somewhat better success may attend comparison of the <span class="date-1943-01">January 1943</span> acquisition notice in YULG of 31 sheets of poems  with the numbers of sheets presently extant&#x2014;but only by stretching the definition of sheet.  Putting aside <span class="title-poem-JRPAPWHATSTIME">Papa whats time</span>  and <span class="title-poem-JRBOSWORTHFIELD">Bosworth Field</span>,  which <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> held back, and  <span class="title-drama-JRASCENTSTBERNARD">Hospice</span>,  which he sent separately, thirty sheets can be counted, plus one sixteen&#x2010;page (or eight&#x2010;sheet) sewn booklet. If it is credible that a cataloger counted the booklet as one  sheet,  we can refer to at least one benchmark, that the present collection corresponds to what <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> originally sent, when considering the possibility of lost or destroyed items.
                            I think it more likely, however, that the YULG count of thirty&#x2010;one refers, not to physical sheets, but titles of poems&#x2014;i.e., the notice ought to have read  sheets of 31 poems.  One can arrive at that number by counting the individual titles in <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>, for both <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> and <span class="title-manuscript-MSX">X</span>. <span class="title-manuscript-MSX">MS X</span> is recognizable in the YULG notice by the listing of one of its items, a <span class="date-1836-03-31">31 March 1836</span> verse letter to <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> (see <span class="title-manuscript-MSX">MS X</span>,  Content,  e). If one discounts this item as listed separately, as well as the poems <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> held back from <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>, one can imagine a cataloger at Yale using the <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span> cursorily to check the titles of pieces delivered to Yale. This would still tell us that the present collection largely corresponds to what <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> sent, although it provides no certainty that portions of individual titles&#x2014;sheets of  <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</span>  and  <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</span>,  items that can be only partially reconciled with the earlier descriptions&#x2014;may not have been lost or misplaced after, rather than before, the collection arrived at Yale.
                            At some point after acquiring <span class="title-manuscriipt-MSIA">MS IA</span> from <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, Yale enclosed most of <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>s original items in a folder labeled  <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">Early Poems IA</span>  but sorted a few other items probably from <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> into other, separate folders labeled  <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</span>  and  <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span>  (see  Content,  a and g, below; neither of these separate folders is listed in the Beinecke&#x02BC;s card catalog, unlike  <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">Early Poems IA</span>  and folders containing other items donated by <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>). All three folders are enclosed in a box labeled  <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin, John</span>, <span class="date-1819-1900">1819&#x2013;1900</span> / Miscellaneous Manuscripts,  along with folders devoted to other manuscripts, which are unrelated to <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>.
                        Of these manuscripts in the box that are unrelated to <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>, some were once included in <span class="title-manuscript-MSX">MS X</span>, a volume that was split up like <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> and donated by <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> in <span class="date-1942">1942</span>: nos. 109, 203, 215, 256, and the  <span class="title-poem-JRPEACESONG">Peace Song</span>,  and the  <span class="title-poem-JRZODIACSONG">Zodiac Song</span>  (see part 1, <span class="title-manuscript-MSX">MS X</span>).

                        Possible discrepancies exist between the items as presently disposed in the folder <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> or elsewhere in the box  Miscellaneous Manuscripts  and their description in earlier accounts. The discrepancies, if they represent actual losses and not merely confusions arising from inadequate descriptions, might well be blamed on destruction by <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>&#x02BC;s fire; however, with the exception of one, rather slender piece of evidence (see &#x005B;b&#x005D; below), documentation is too scanty to confirm if, when, or how the losses occurred. If <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> disassembled <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> prior to the fire, it is even possible that he had already misplaced an item or two or sold them separately, their present whereabouts unknown.
                        a) In the folder <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">Early Poems IA</span>, draft for portion of <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</span>, no. 46, single torn sheet, 12 &#x00D7; 20 cm; 34 lines in ink beginning  come on good horse and let us see, from the third book of the poem, lines 26&#x2013;59, as fair&#x2010;copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> (with minor variants and deleted lines). On verso, 12 lines in very rough pencil draft of two passages from the third book of the poem as fair&#x2010;copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>:  martin took his task a&#x005B;s(?)&#x005D; guide / &#x005B;(?)&#x005D;d all the women did in him confide,  which are interesting variants of lines 86&#x2013;87 of fair copy; and, following a horizontal line, draft of lines 14&#x2013;25 of the fair copy. On the verso, portions of the pencil draft were lost with tears at the edges, which is not the case with the ink script on the other side, <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span> writing around the tears. Thus, the ink copy must have been written after the pencil (the lines are sequential, except for lines 86&#x2013;87), and therefore, I believe, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was fair&#x2010;copying in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> as he drafted. This is one of several indications that <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</span>  draft, far from offering  the earliest example known of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s handwriting, was composed in <span class="date-1829">1829</span> like its fair copy.
                        This manuscript must have been the first item in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> when bound since <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> heads his table of contents  Very early MSS. &#x201C;Come on, good horse&#x201D; &#x0026;c.  <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>.  also lists it as the first item (79.A.1) and quotes from the manuscript extensively. <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> describes the manuscript as consisting of  2 pp.,  and, if he means two sides of one sheet, then this item fully matches his description.
                        As already mentioned (Description, above) <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s sheet is mounted onto a slightly larger sheet watermarked &#x005B;(?)&#x005D;ETOWGOOD FINE, which I assume to have been cut from the bound <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>. The mounting sheet, but not the manuscript itself, shows slight evidence of charring.
                        The Yale box  Miscellaneous Manuscripts  holds another folder labeled <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</span>,  containing a 12.5 &#x00D7; 20&#x2013;cm sheet written in pencil, 34 lines in pencil from the second book of the poem as fair&#x2010;copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>, lines 29&#x2013;63, beginning  now must we leave poor martin there  and continuing to bottom of its verso,  you are under my protection then I say goodbye.  These lines together with those on the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> sheet thus add up to the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>&#x02BC;s listing of  <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</span>  versified, 80 lines  in the original <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> (<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:530).
                        <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">The Library Edition</span> dates these 80 lines as <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, but the two manuscripts suggest no reason for dating their drafts from books II or III much earlier than their <span class="date-1829">1829</span> fair copy in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>, since the manuscripts are similar in paper, size, and pencil handwriting. Moreover, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> appears not to have used longhand earlier than <span class="date-1828">1828</span> (see no. 21; see also no. 46 for further remarks on the dating of  <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</span> ).
                        The pencil draft in the separate folder must have formed part of the second item in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> when bound, since <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>. lists in second place (item 79.A.2, following the ink manuscript of  <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</span> )  4 pp. in pencil &#x005B;of&#x005D; a metrical transcription from <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">Monastery</span>.  But if by  4 pp.  <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> means the rectos and versos of two sheets, and if his item 79.A.2 truly consisted entirely of  <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</span>,  then one sheet is presently missing.
                        <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> left other evidence that he knew of a another sheet. The pencil draft, like the ink draft in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA folder</span>, is mounted on a slightly larger, charred sheet (watermark showing only a seated <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">Brittania</span> in an oval surmounted by a crown). On this sheet, <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> wrote below the manuscript,  This (with the previous pp.) is a rhymed version of passages from chapter II of <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</span> (first edition), vol. 1, 182&#x005B;(?)&#x005D; / CEG 19&#x005B;(?)&#x005D;  (my emphasis; part of the note lost with trimmed, burnt edges of the mounting sheet). Since <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> apparently counted  pages  or rectos and versos of sheets, <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>&#x02BC;s  pp.  might have referred only to the ink manuscript (<span class="title-poem-JRGOODHORSE">come on good horse</span> ), which remains extant, and not to that manuscript plus another unknown one; but, if so, he would have erred in identifying both the ink manuscript and the pencil draft as versifying chapter two of <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>&#x02BC;s novel, for the ink manuscript is taken from chapter three.
                        The problem is not clarified by comparing <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>&#x02BC;s records with <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s. <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents included with <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> lists three  sheets  of  Very early MSS.,  starting with  come on good horse&#x2014;this entry certainly referring to the first, ink manuscript of  <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</span>  but also to two other unnamed items, whether he means manuscript sheets (recto and verso) or sheets used to mount manuscripts. <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s other two items may have been <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>&#x02BC;s two sheets ( 4 pp. ) of pencil manuscript of  <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</span>,  again pointing to a presently missing second sheet. But, again, the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> specifies  80 lines,  which are presently accountable in two manuscripts. (<span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span> fails to mention the total number of lines in either his  2 pp.  or his  4 pp.  manuscripts, just as, annoyingly, the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> fails to mention the number of sheets.)
                        Thus, in summary, inconclusive evidence points to a missing sheet of  <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">Monastery</span>  draft&#x2014;<span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s third  sheet,  or <span class="persName-">Goodspeed</span>&#x02BC;s two more  pages.  To identify that missing sheet, we might look to manuscript, not of  <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</span>,  but of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</span>, b below. This item, however, raises problems of its own.
                        b) Also in the Yale folder labeled  <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</span>  is a 12.5 &#x00D7; 20&#x2010;cm folded sheet, written on all four sides in pencil, beginning Orpheus and bootes now.  This is partial draft of  <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</span>,  no. 21, which survives in other copies. This manuscript is pasted onto a sheet that, like the mounting for the ink  <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">Monastery</span>  manuscript, is watermarked &#x005B;(?)&#x005D;ETOWGOOD FINE and is slightly charred.
                        The <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> mentions <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</span>  as having been bound in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> following <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</span> (<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:530), and one might suspect that here is the third item in <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents as well as <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>&#x02BC;s additional  <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">Monastery</span>  manuscript, which he misidentified; and, indeed, this draft of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</span>  does physically resemble the pencil draft of <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</span>.  But this solution founders, since, first, the folded sheet comprises four  pages,  not <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>&#x02BC;s two; second, <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> does separately itemize <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</span>  as following both the ink and the pencil <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">Monastery</span>  manuscripts (Cat., item 79.A.3). Compounding the mystery, <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> describes a  6 pp.  manuscript, not a four&#x2010;page folded sheet, suggesting that a single sheet (i.e.,  2 pp. ) is presently missing from this poem, as well.
                        <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents included with <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> fails to list  <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</span>  altogether, unless he included it among the three items of  Very Early MSS. ; that is, <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s  1&#x2013;3  may correspond to <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>&#x02BC;s item 79.A.1&#x2013;3 if <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> counted the ink manuscript of  <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</span>  as one item, the pencil manuscript as a second, and  <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</span>  as a third. In both <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents and <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>, these items are followed by <span class="title-poem-JRPAPWHATSTIME">&#x201C;Papa whats time&#x201D;</span>.  But, as already explained, <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>&#x02BC;s page count cannot be reconciled with the extant manuscripts. Moreover, why does <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents list  <span class="title-poem-JRPAPAWHATSTIME">Papa whats time</span>  as a fifth item, skipping over a fourth enumeration? Could <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s 1&#x2013;3  have referred only to the individual sheets of  <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</span>,  including the now missing sheet, while the skipped fourth item in his list was <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</span>? Owing to the sketchiness of <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s manner of describing the contents of <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">
                        MS IA</span>, one returns to <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span> as the more accurate description when <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> was still bound, and this description clearly indicates a sheet of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</span>  that, like a sheet of the  <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</span>, cannot presently be accounted for.
                        In <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span>&#x02BC;s transcription of  <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</span>  (from the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> version) among her papers at the Morgan Library, she points to the line  Orpheus and bootes new &#x005B;sic&#x005D;  and remarks,  Here begins version in <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> ms. ; that is, the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> version begins at line 27 of the complete poem as fair&#x2010;copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>&#x2014;and the manuscript does appear fragmentary&#x2014;and carries through to the end. <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span>&#x02BC;s gloss suggests that a sheet (perhaps containing draft of the opening 26 lines) may have been unavailable to her, as well as to us (HGVP, box F.X), which may tend to confirm that nothing has been lost or misplaced at least since <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> arrived at Yale (see  Description  above; <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span>&#x02BC;s transcription is undated, but she had been steadily transcribing <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> material since the late <span class="date-1920-1929">1920s</span> and probably examined the <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> collection not long after it came to Yale in <span class="date-1942">1942</span>).
                        As discussed in the note to no. 21, Lancaster holds two photographs (one of the front and one of the back) of another manuscript of  <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</span>  different from the extant Yale manuscript, a photograph that was made in the course of compiling the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>. The existence or location of the original of this manuscript is unknown, but it was clearly intermediate between the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> draft and the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> fair copy: it showed a printed fair copy of the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> draft version, with longhand revisions that were carried into the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> version. The lost intermediate fair copy tends to support the probable loss of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">Constellations</span>  material from <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>, since the photograph shows  orpheus and bootes now  as line 27, proving that draft of the first 26 lines must once have existed.
                        Could the photograph show the lost <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">IA manuscript</span> itself? The photograph reveals what looks like a binding behind the perimeter of the manuscript. If this was the  red&#x2010;cloth, thin folio  of the early descriptions of <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>, the photograph must significantly have reduced its actual size (as compared, for example, with the paper for <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents, which is larger). Even if the photograph reduced the original, however, it still fails to resolve the mystery. Instead of the presumably missing two pages, or unfolded single sheet, of  <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</span>,  the photograph shows a folded sheet (i.e., 4 pages, although the manuscript itself is unnumbered), with the poem fair&#x2010;copied on 1r&#x2010;v and revisions scrawled on 2r&#x2010;v. The sheet appears to have been laid open flat against some sort of backing and photographed, first, from the front (showing pp. 4 and 1) and, second, from the back (showing pp. 2 and 3). Photographed in this manner, front and back, the manuscript cannot have been bound permanently along its fold. If the manuscript had been bound, the photograph would show, first on the left, the back page of an unrelated manuscript, and then on the right, the first page of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</span>, followed by the inside spread of the poem. That this is not the case is proved by a revised line of the poem, which was begun on p. 3, being finished on p. 4, the page to the left of p. 1 in the photograph.
                        Of course, the folded sheet shown in the photograph could have been bound afterward in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>. In that case, in order for <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> to arrive at the six pages mentioned in his <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>, he would have to have counted, along with the four&#x2010;page draft extant in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>, only the two pages of fair copy on the folded sheet in the photograph, ignoring the revisions on pp. 3&#x2013;4. This seems to me improbable, since, while <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> might have ignored blank pages (see, e.g., c below), he would not have discounted draft revision.
                        c) A copy of  <span class="title-poem-JRPAPAWHATSTIME">Papa whats time</span> a figure or a sense  (no. 4, as reprinted and described in &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#RFL" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 150&#x2013;51) is a 12.5 &#x00D7; 20&#x2013;cm folded sheet. It is listed as following  <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</span> in <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>,<span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>, item 79.A.4, and in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:530; and the title occurs following the first entry,  Very Early MSS.,  in <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents. <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> describes  2 pp. in pencil,  rather than the expected four pages, presumably because p. 1v is blank, and 2v holds only the superscription described in &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#RFL" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 150 (headnote). The manuscript is undamaged by fire and lies loose in the Yale folder  <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">Early Poems IA</span>.  
                        d) All descriptions (<span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>, item 79.B; <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:530; <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents for <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>) place  <span class="title-poem-JRBOSWORTHFIELD">Bosworth Field</span>  (no. 69) following c above. The 19 &#x00D7; 11.5&#x2013;cm fair copy is undamaged by fire and lies loose in the Yale folder  <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">Early Poems IA</span>.  Like c above, the manuscript is a presentation copy, a folded sheet with ink fair copy on the facing inside spread. Both blank outer pages are used for addresses: on one, &#x201C;For my Papa / from <span class="persName-JR">J. Ruskin</span> / <span class="date-1830-01-01">1 January 1830</span> / Age 10&#x00BE; years&#x201D; ; on the other, &#x201C;For my Papa  and, in <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s hand,  Aged 10&#x00BE; years / <span class="date-1830-01-01">1 Jany 1830</span>&#x201D;. Accordingly, in their dated list for <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> (<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:530), Cook and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> correctly ascribe the poem to late <span class="date-1829">1829</span>&#x2014;that is, composition in late <span class="date-1829">1829</span> for <span class="title-poem-JRNEWYEARS1827">New Year&#x02BC;s</span> presentation.
                        e) <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOG">Catalogue</span>, item 79.C, cites  Poems&#x2014;<span class="title-poem-JRVESUVIUS">Vesuvius</span>, <span class="title-poem-JRTRAFALGAR">Trafalgar</span>, <span class="title-poem-JRTHEYEW">The Yew</span> and <span class="title-poem-JRDEATH">Death</span>&#x2014;a similar MS. to the foregoing &#x005B;i.e., <span class="title-poem-BOSWORTHFIELD">Bosworth Field</span>,&#x02BC; d above&#x005D;. 8 pp. &#x2018;For &#x005B;sic&#x005D; my Papa <span class="date-1830-02-08">February 8th 1830</span>.&#x2019;&#x2014;&#x2018;by <span class="persName-JR">J. Ruskin</span> aged 11 years this day <span class="date-1830-02-08">8 Feby 1830</span>.&#x2019;  <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> has associated the four poems (8 pp. total) with a cover sheet for an unnamed presentation poem, inscribed &#x201C;by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>  To my Papa / <span class="date-1830-02-08">February 8th 1830</span>, and annotated by his father  by <span class="persName-JR">J. Ruskin</span> aged 11 years / this day / <span class="date-1830-02-08">8 Feby 1830</span>&#x201D;.  This cover sheet, like the four sheets (8 pp.) containing the poems, lies loose (and undamaged by fire) in the Yale folder  <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">Early Poems IA</span>.  Almost certainly, only  <span class="title-poem-JRVESUVIUS">Vesuvius</span>, <span class="title-poem-JRTRAFALGAR">Trafalgar</span>,  and  <span class="title-poem-JRTHEYEW">The Yew</span>  (nos. 70&#x2013;72) belong with the cover sheet, while  <span class="title-poem-JRDEATH">Death</span>  (no. 73) should be separated from the group.
                        <span class="title-poem-JRVESUVIUS">Vesuvius</span>,   <span class="title-poem-JRTRAFALGAR">Trafalgar</span>,  and  <span class="title-poem-JRTHEYEW">The Yew</span>  are fair&#x2010;copied successively on both sides of three 20.5 &#x00D7; 12.5&#x2013;cm sheets identical to the cover sheet. When the folds and torn edges are matched up, the cover proves to have followed the last poem,  <span class="title-poem-JRTHEYEW">The Yew</span>,  with the address on the outside. This physical evidence is confirmed independently by the <span class="date-1830-02">February 1830</span> dates ascribed to  <span class="title-poem-JRVESUVIUS">Vesuvius</span>  and  <span class="title-poem-JRTRAFALGAR">Trafalgar</span>,  nos. 70&#x2013;71, by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself in their <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> copies.
                        The fourth poem,  <span class="title-poem-JRDEATH">Death</span>  (no. 73) probably does not belong to this group, since it is copied on a separate sheet of a slightly different size (19.75 &#x00D7; 12.5 cm), different watermark ( J WHA&#x005B;(?)&#x005D; / TURKE&#x005B;(?)&#x005D; / 18&#x005B;(?)&#x005D;  as compared to  HOLDSWORTH / &#x0026; / PHILLIPS used for the other three poems), and unmatching horizontal folds. This copy of  <span class="title-poem-JRDEATH">Death</span>  should be dated, rather, by its <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> copy, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> assigned to <span class="date-1830-03">March 1830</span> It is true, however, that the lettering style for this presentation copy is very similar to that for the other three poems, as well as for  <span class="title-poem-JRBOSWORTHFIELD">Bosworth Field</span>,  d above.
                        The early editors, as so often, contribute only obfuscation. In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:530, the editors group together  <span class="title-poem-JRBOSWORTHFIELD">Bosworth Field</span>,   <span class="title-poem-JRVESUVIUS">Vesuvius</span>,   <span class="title-poem-JRTRAFALGAR">Trafalgar</span>,  and  <span class="title-poem-JRTHEYEW">The Yew</span>  under <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, and they assign  <span class="title-poem-JRDEATH">Death</span>  alone to <span class="date-1830">1830</span>, apparently pairing  <span class="title-poem-JRDEATH">Death</span>  with the cover sheet. This would be the least probable grouping. The <span class="date-1830-01-01">1 January 1830</span> (composed <span class="date-1829">1829</span>)  <span class="title-poem-JRBOSWORTHFIELD">Bosworth Field</span>  manuscript has nothing to do, physically, with the other manuscripts, and the other poems are independently ascribable to <span class="date-1830">1830</span>, not <span class="date-1829">1829</span>.
                        <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents for <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> does properly distinguish between  <span class="title-poem-JRBOSWORTHFIELD">Bosworth Field</span>,   <span class="title-poem-JRDEATH">Death</span>,  and the trio  <span class="title-poem-JRVESUVIUS">Vesuvius</span>,   <span class="title-poem-JRTRAFALGAR">Trafalgar</span>,  and  <span class="title-poem-JRTHEYEW">The Yew</span>  as three separate items. His sketchy description does not mention the <span class="date-1830-08-02">8 February 1830</span> cover sheet, much less whether it might still have been physically attached to the trio of poems at this time. It is possible, however, that his cryptic  7&#x2013;10  for  <span class="title-poem-JRVESIVIUS">Vesuvius</span>,   <span class="title-poem-JRTRAFALGAR">Trafalgar</span>,  and  <span class="title-poem-JRTHEYEW">The Yew</span>  included the cover sheet to make a total of four  sheets.  
                        f) All descriptions (<span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>,<span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>, item 79.D; <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:530; <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents for <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>) list  My Father&#x02BC;s Birthday  for <span class="date-1833">1833</span> ( <span class="date-1833-05">The month of May</span>, <span class="date-1833-05">the month of May</span>,  no. 178), which is in the Yale folder  <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">Early Poems IA</span>.  <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> describes the manuscript as  1&#x00BD; pp., 4to &#x2014;i.e., two 20 &#x00D7; 25&#x2010;cm sheets, one of them taken up by the poem on its recto and its verso, and the other devoted only to the address  To my Father / <span class="date-1833-05-10">10th May 183</span>. The sheets, burned on the left and right edges, are enclosed in plastic.
                        <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> ascribes his printing of the poem (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#RFL" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;,  277&#x2013;78) to RMS I (i.e., <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span>), but I have been unable to locate a copy of the poem either in that volume&#x02BC;s table of contents or in the volume itself. I would assume, therefore, that <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> has confused <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span> with <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>, except that his printing shows a few slight variants from the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> copy. These may be errors or carry&#x2010;overs from the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> printing.
                        g) The parts of <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</span>, no. 180, as they were described in earlier accounts of <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>, all appear to be extant, either in the folder  <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">Early Poems IA</span>  or elsewhere in the box  Miscellaneous Manuscripts.  In the folder  IA  are two sheets (20.2 &#x00D7; 25.2 cm) containing copies (perhaps draft or semifinal copy) of the first five poems (without their prose sections) of no. 180, in the order those poems appear in the fair copy, <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> numbered the lines of these poems sequentially&#x2014;that is, without starting his numbering anew with each poem&#x2014;showing that he had established their order for the fair copy in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>. The first of these two sheets contains the following:
                        <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">Calais</span>  (poem only, lines numbered by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 1&#x2013;24, complete as fair&#x2010;copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>; copy in <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s hand).
                        <span class="title-poem-JRCASSEL">Cassel</span>  (poem only, untitled in manuscript, lines numbered by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 25&#x2013;51, i.e., lines 1&#x2013;27 as fair&#x2010;copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>; copy in <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s hand from line 25 to 42, and in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s hand from line 43 to 51 &#x005B;i.e., <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s hand starts with the ecclesiastical procession,  While far beneath in long array,  etc.).
                        A key for a code, nearly every letter of the alphabet represented by a code symbol (not employed in any known manuscript; see no. 99), at bottom of recto and in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s hand.
                        As noted, this sheet is largely in <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s hand. It must therefore be <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>, item 79.E,  <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">Calais</span>. (MS., 2 pp., 4to, in the hand of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s father),  although the dealer is incorrect to ascribe the copy to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> entirely. By  4to,  <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> means the large size of the sheet. Although only slightly darkened by fire on one edge, the sheet is enclosed in plastic.
                        The second sheet of this manuscript resumes  <span class="title-poem-JRCASSEL">Cassel</span>  and includes three more poems:
                        <span class="title-poem-JRCASSEL">Cassel</span>  (poem only, lines numbered by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 52&#x2013;62, i.e., lines 28&#x2013;38 as fair&#x2010;copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>).
                        <span class="title-poem-JRLILLE">Lille</span>  (poem only, lines numbered by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 63&#x2013;112, i.e., complete as fair&#x2010;copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>).
                        <span class="title-poem-JRBRUSSELS">Brussels</span>  (poem only, lines numbered by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 113&#x2013;73, i.e., complete as fair&#x2010;copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>).
                        <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMEUSE">The Meuse</span>  (poem only, written sideways in the margin, front side of the sheet, i.e., the side with  <span class="title-poem-JRCASSEL">Cassel</span>  and part of  <span class="title-poem-JRLILLE">Lille</span> ; complete as fair&#x2010;copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>).
                        This second sheet is entirely in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s hand. It must be <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>,<span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>, item 79.G, from which he quotes eight lines of the poem  <span class="title-poem-JRLILLE">Lille</span>,  and which he describes identically to item 79.E above as  2 pp., 4to.  This sheet is more seriously damaged than its mate and is enclosed in plastic.
                        This second sheet is what <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> lists as <span class="title-poem-JRLILLE">Lille</span>, <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMEUSE">The Meuse</span> in his table of contents, while the first sheet must be represented by one of the items in the entry  <span class="title-composite-JRCALAISCOMP">Calais</span> (2 items).  As I remarked above ( Description ), however, the penciled gloss  (2 items)  appears to be <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>&#x02BC;s.
                        In a separate folder in the Yale box and labeled  <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span>,  more material from no. 180 is fair&#x2010;copied on a folded sheet, 12.6 &#x00D7; 20.2 cm. This is <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>., item 79.F ( Prose and verse&#x2014;<span class="title-composite-JRCALAISCOMP">Calais</span>, <span class="title-composite-JRPASSINGTHEALPSCOMP">Passing the Alps</span>, <span class="title-composite-JRMILANCOMP">Milan Cathedral</span>, <span class="title-composite-JRANDERNACHTCOMP">Andernacht</span> and <span class="title-composite-JRSTGOARCOMP">St. Goar</span>&#x2014;4 pp. ), and presumably the second of the  (2 items),  according to the notation next to <span class="title-composite-JRCALAISCOMP">Calais</span>  in <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents. (<span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s description <span class="title-composite-JRCALAISCOMP">Calais</span> could fit either of the two sheets starting with <span class="title-composite-JRCALAISCOMP">Calais</span>, prose or verse, with the  &#x0026;c.  standing for the other poems on the respective sheets. His ascription of the single digit  13  to the item(s) is as obscure as his other enumerations.) This small folded sheet escaped fire damage, as did other manuscripts of its size in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">IA</span>.
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> numbered lines of poetry on this manuscript, as well. It consists of the following:
                        <span class="title-essay-JRCALAISPROSE">Calais</span>  (prose only, complete as fair&#x2010;copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span>).
                        <span class="title-poem-JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">Passing the Alps</span>  (poem; lines numbered by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 324&#x2013;59; a unique copy of this poem, neither fair&#x2010;copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> nor drafted in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>).

                        <span class="title-poem-JRANDERNACHT">Andernacht</span>  (poem; lines numbered by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 378&#x2013;403; complete as fair&#x2010;copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> and printed <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, Works, 2:354 n.&#x2014;i.e., not the main copytext used for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:353&#x2013;54, which is from a later revision of  <span class="title-poem-JRANDERNACHT">Andernacht</span>).
                        <span class="title-poem-JRSTGOAR">St. Goar</span>  (poem; lines numbered by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 404&#x2013;29; complete as fair&#x2010;copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> and printed <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:359 n. 1&#x2014;i.e., not the main copytext used for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:359&#x2013;60, which is from a later revision of  <span class="title-poem-JRSTGOAR">St. Goar</span>).
                        This copy of selected prose and verse&#x2014;like the two sheets containing the poems  <span class="title-poem-JRCALAIS">Calais</span>, <span class="title-poem-JRCASSEL">Cassel</span>, <span class="title-poem-JRLILLE">Lille</span>, <span class="title-poem-JRBRUSSELSPOEM">Brussels</span>, and <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMEUSE">The Meuse</span> &#x2014;probably dates from relatively early in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s project, no. 180, since  <span class="title-poem-JRANDERNACHT">Andernacht</span>  and  <span class="title-poem-JRSTGOAR">St. Goar</span>  were later revised, perhaps sometime in <span class="date-1835">1835</span>, for publication in <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</span> (see note to no. 180).
                        h) <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>, <span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOG">Catalogue</span>, (item 79.H) and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span> (2:530) list <span class="title-book-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1834">1834</span> birthday address to his father, no. 192, together with  <span class="title-poem-JRCRYSTALHUNTER">The Crystal Hunter</span>,  no. 188. <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents for <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> is more ambiguous, but he probably means to include both poems under the entry <span class="title-poem-JRTOHISFATHER">To his father. Birthday ode</span> <span class="date-1834">1834</span>  since, in the presentation copy itself,  <span class="title-poem-JRCRYSTALHUNTER">The Crystal Hunter</span>  begins on the verso of the prefatory address  My Dearest Father.  (In <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, however, no. 192 is headed differently as  The Address  and drafted separately from no. 188.)
                        <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> cites  3 pp.  for this manuscript, an error that seems unaccountable except as a confusion with j below, which is fair&#x2010;copied on the same size paper. The <span class="date-1834">1834</span> poem is fair&#x2010;copied on four 25 &#x00D7; 20&#x2010;cm sheets (i.e., 8 pp.), badly charred on the top and bottom edges and sealed in plastic, and contained in the Yale folder  <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">Early Poems IA</span>.  The sheets are written on seven sides and numbered 1&#x2013;7 by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, with the final page left blank except for  To my Father.  On p. 7, there is a notation, almost obliterated by the burnt edge,  &#x005B;Johns(?)&#x005D; poetry / <span class="date-1834-05">May 1834</span>. 
                        This birthday poem marks a departure from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s earlier method of fashioning presentation copies, which was to fold a single sheet sideways to form a small (approximately 12 &#x00D7; 20&#x2010;cm) pamphlet. Here, two columns of text are written on a full sheet broadside, and two more on the verso broadside. The text on the verso is written upside&#x2010;down to the text on the front, so that, when the sheet is flipped over, the text still appears right&#x2010;side&#x2010;up. These more spacious presentations become the rule after the mid&#x2010;1830s.
                        i)  <span class="title-poem-JRTWELVEMONTHSALLROLLINGROUND">Twelve months all rolling round have past</span>,  no. 164, is listed in all descriptions: <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents for <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>; <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>,<span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>, item 79.I (as  another birthday poem to his father, 4 pp., undated ); and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:530. The poem is untitled and undated but listed as <span class="date-1831">1831</span> in the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>. Like other items of its size in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>, it was unaffected by fire.
                        When this manuscript is compared against <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s ode for his father&#x02BC;s birthday of <span class="date-1831">1831</span>, bound in <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span> (see  Content,  g), the two manuscripts can be seen to match in every particular: they are both 20 &#x00D7; 12.3&#x2010;cm folded sheets of light blue&#x2010;green paper, display the same  copperplate  hand (<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s fancy scripts can vary, but the capital letters in these two manuscripts are clearly imitated from the same source), and even match up in their horizontal folds.
                        Obviously, when the <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span> manuscript declares at the bottom of 1v that  I here do beg to give you an ensample,  the reader is meant to look for the  ensample  at the top of the folded insert&#x2014;i.e., what is now the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> manuscript&#x2014;which begins <span class="title-poem-JRTWELVEMONTHSALLROLLINGROUND">Twelve months all rolling round have past</span>.  In his printing of the <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span> ode, <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> breaks off with  I here do beg to give you an ensample  but remarks in a note that the draft in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> extends beyond this line, adding  fifty&#x2010;four lines to illustrate both the comic and &#x2018;flowery&#x2019; styles of poetry  and that these additional lines begin  Twelve months all rolling round have past  (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#RFL" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 256). The fair copy of those lines (albeit with revisions from the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VIII</span> version) became separated from the fair copy of the poem&#x02BC;s opening.
                        For the relation between <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s birthday odes to his father for <span class="date-1831">1831</span> and <span class="date-1832">1832</span>, and for prior confusion over dating of these odes, see nos. 118a and 164.
                        j) All descriptions (<span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>,<span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>, item 79.J; <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:530; <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents for <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>) list <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1836">1836</span> birthday poem for his father,  Congratu&#x2014;  (no. 231). <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> describes this manuscript as  3 pp., 4to. &#x2014;correctly, if he was counting sides of sheets, as usual. The text is written on three sides of two 20 &#x00D7; 25&#x2010;cm sheets, with the fourth given to the address  To my Father / <span class="date-1836-05-10">May 10th 1836</span>  Like h above and unlike birthday presentation poems of earlier years,  Congratu&#x2014;  is written out using the full sides of sheets, not half&#x2010;pages pamphlet style&#x2014;only here, the text is written top to bottom, not broadside as in h. With their left and right edges charred, the sheets are enclosed in plastic and contained in the folder  <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">Early Poems IA</span>. 
                        k) All descriptions (<span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>,<span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>, item 79.K; <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:530; <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents for <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>) list  <span class="title-composite-JRMONTBLANCCOMP">Mont Blanc</span>.  This 19.7 &#x00D7; 13.2&#x2010;cm sheet, written on both sides, is correctly noted in all accounts as a transcription in <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s hand. Although the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> declares this  the only complete copy  (<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:468), the manuscript can only be deemed longer than the <span class="title-manuscript-">MS VII</span> version, not necessarily complete, since the writing extends top to bottom on both sides of this torn half&#x2010;sheet. For speculation about the poem&#x02BC;s dating, see  Undatable Pieces,  B. The manuscript is not damaged by fire and lies in the folder  <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">Early Poems IA</span>. 
                        l) All descriptions (<span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>,<span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>, item 79.L; <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:530; <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents for <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>) list  <span class="title-pome-JRATHENS">Athens</span>  (no. 135), a 19.7 &#x00D7; 12.2&#x2010;cm folded sheet. None of the descriptions mentions the handwriting, however, which appears to be <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s. The title and one correction are in pencil (possibly <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s own hand), the stanzas in ink (<span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s hand?). The copy contains only seven unnumbered stanzas of this much longer, although unfinished, poem; but, since the manuscript is written on only three sides, it may represent all that had been composed at the time of its transcription. If so, <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> (<span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>, item 79.L) and <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> (<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:530) are correct to attribute this manuscript to <span class="date-1831">1831</span>, while the entire poem should be dated <span class="date-1831-1832">1831&#x2013;32</span>, as Cook and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> correctly note (<span class="persName-JRWORKSLE">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:537). For complete information on dating, see no. 135. This manuscript is undamaged and lies loose in the folder  <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">Early Poems IA</span>. 
                        m) All descriptions (<span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>,<span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>, item 79.M; <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:530; <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents for <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>) list  <span class="title-drama-JRASCENTSTBERNARD">A Visit to the Hospice of St. Bernard</span>  (no. 209). The manuscript consists of 12 sheets, 19.5 &#x00D7; 25 cm, watermarked <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, with the pages numbered 1&#x2013;24 by a hand other than <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s. The text is neatly disposed on hand&#x2010;ruled lines. This fair copy, as the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> remarks,  goes no further than the opening of Scene 5  (<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 1:505 n. 1); specifically, p. 24 ends with the phrase &#x201C;torrent of the Drance, whose dark waters have worn.&#x201D;  Since this phrase extends to the bottom right corner, further fair copy could have existed, although the extant draft in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> continues only through some portion of scene 6. The sheets of the fair copy are charred on the left and right edges, and encased in plastic. The ink is badly faded, especially from p. 8 to the end. The sheets are contained in the folder  <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">Early Poems IA</span>. 
                                n) All descriptions (<span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>,<span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>, item 79.N; <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:530; <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents for <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>) list <span class="title-poem-JRSCYTHIANBANQUET">A Scythian Banquet Song</span>  (no. 259). <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>&#x02BC;s description of  4 pp.  must be revised to take account of fire damage. Of the  4 pp. &#x2014;or two 19.5 &#x00D7; 25&#x2010;cm sheets (one watermarked <span class="date-1837">1837</span>) written on both sides, now in the folder  <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">Early Poems IA</span> &#x2014;one sheet has been separated at its fold into two 19.5 &#x00D7; 12.5&#x2010;cm sheets, so that the manuscript is now encased in a total of three plastic sleeves. The manuscript suffered especially intrusive charring, costing some lines at the top and bottom of the sheets, which have been trimmed in places.
                        The manuscript holds only the first 16 stanzas of the 27&#x2010;stanza poem, presented in the manner of h above&#x2014;the stanzas written in two columns broadside and continued in the same style on the verso. All four sides of the original sheets are filled, suggesting that this fair copy could have once continued onto further sheets, but <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>&#x02BC;s  4 pp.  indicates that only these two sheets were included in the bound <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>. <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>, in his table of contents, enumerates the manuscript as  24.25.,  as if it consisted of two sheets, but his meaning is obscure, since he does not so designate other manuscripts consisting of multiple sheets. The <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> fails to clarify whether the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> copy, as the editors knew it, was complete (<span class="persName-">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:57 n.).
                        The manuscript is early enough to record a change in title, #FN01# <span class="title-poem-JRSCYTHIANBANQUET">A Scythian Banquet</span> #FN02# Song, and the headnote differs from the published version:  The taste of the Scythians #FN03# in household furniture if we may trust to Herodotus was somewhat peculiar: their drinking cups for instance, being generally the skulls of their enemies  (<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:57). A few minor changes in wording #FN04# in the final lines of stanzas 1 and 7, respectively) are accounted for in the published text. Otherwise, the manuscript is neatly written, perhaps too neat to be the original draft that,  as appears from letters to <span class="persName-WHH">W. H. Harrison</span>,  was composed  in a single day, before <span class="date-1838-03">March 1838</span>  (<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:57 n. 1). Note that, in another letter to <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> of <span class="date-1838-08-01">1 August 1838</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> still entitles the poem a  Drinking Song  (<span class="title-manuscript-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:69), so the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> copy&#x2014;or at least the revisions on this copy&#x2014;may date from after that time.
                        o) All descriptions (<span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>,<span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>, item 79.O; <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:530; <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents for <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>) list  <span class="title-poem-JRBROKENCHAIN">The Broken Chain</span>,  no. 245a. This is a 21 &#x00D7; 13.5&#x2013;cm, 16&#x2013;page sewn booklet, with pp. 2&#x2013;10 numbered by the original hand and with pp. 11&#x2013;16 left blank and uncut. This fair copy, which is in <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s hand, contains only stanzas 17&#x2013;26 of part V; however, nothing has been lost from <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>, since <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents specifies  Stanzas 17.26, and both <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span> (2:530) and <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span>,<span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>, concur. The manuscript is undamaged by fire and lies loose in the folder  <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">Early Poems IA</span>. 
                        p) The <span class="date-1832">1832</span> prose translation of the <span class="title-poem-JRILIAD">Iliad</span>, misdated as <span class="date-1842">1842</span> by <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> (<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:530; see no. 160a), is contained in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> folder. This is a fair copy on six 31.5 &#x00D7; 19&#x2010;&#x2013;cm sheets; each sheet was folded once vertically, so the sheets could be assembled as a quire, forming a booklet with 16 &#x00D7; 19&#x2013;cm pages, each page holding two vertical columns of text. The paper is hand&#x2010;ruled and the text obsessively neat, resembling (except in its double&#x2010;column format) the Sermon Books, MSS IIA&#x2010;E.
                        In its present condition, the quire has been separated into individual sheets, each sheet laid flat and enclosed in clear plastic, owing to fire damage. Thus, each sheet consists of four pages. Since neither the pages nor the sheets are numbered, the following list conjecturally orders them. 
                    
                        The pages are identified by their first and last words:
                        Sheet 1 (p. 1,  Now tell  through  Argos far ; p. 2,  from her  through  hecatombs un ; pp. 23&#x2013;24, blank).
                        Sheet 2 (p. 3,  paid  through  dark ; p. 4,  eyed  through  me that ; pp. 21&#x2013;22, blank).
                        Sheet 3 (p. 5,  the value  through  much more ; p. 6,  than thee  through  the dark&#x2013; ; pp. 19&#x2013;20, blank).
                        Sheet 4 (p. 7,  eyed  through  orator of ; p. 8,  whom  through  not me ; p. 17,  ed words  through  of ten  &#x005B;end of fair copy, column left incomplete, with  127  (i.e., line 129) in pencil and in <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s hand added at end&#x005D;; p. 18, blank).
                        Sheet 5 (p. 9,  and I will  through  left to me ; p. 10,  to turn  through  Greeks took ; p. 15,  the Greeks  through  and spoke ; p. 16,  Hear me  through  with wing ).
                        Sheet 6 (p. 11,  to <span class="persName-fictional_person-CHRYSES">Chryses</span>  through  with the ; p. 12,  hecatomb  through  ascen&#x2013; ; p. 13,  ded soon  through  of the Greeks ; p. 14,  Then answered  through  ships of ).
                        None of the manuscript is missing, since <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:50 specify the translation as extending only to book 2, line 127. <span class="persName-CG">Goodspeed</span> (<span class="title-catalogue-GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</span>, item 79.P) describes  16 pp., double column,  an odd way of counting since he includes only the full double&#x2010;column pages, omitting p. 17 with its single incomplete column.

                  <div class="p">	The dates of the contents of <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> range from <span class="date-1827-1842">1827 or 1828 to 1842</span>.
                        As a bound collection, the compiling and binding of <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> must have been nearly contemporaneous with the preparation of the first two volumes of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>. 
                        <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s remarks about the binding on the title page of the manuscript itself (&#x201C;bound since the publication of the <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891">Poems</span> in <span class="date-1891">1891</span> / and may be added to the list of MS. given there, as IA&#x201D;) 
                        is very like the editors&#x02BC; comment in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span>, 2:530 (&#x201C;this volume has been bound up since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s death, and is thus an addition to the list in the <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891">Poems</span>, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>&#x201D;), 
                        suggesting that the collection was compiled shortly prior to publication of volume 2 (<span class="date-1903">1903</span>) of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>. The fact that <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s table of contents for the manuscript is somewhat confused 
                        (see Description) further argues for the manuscript&#x02BC;s compilation during the hectic lead&#x2010;up to initial publication of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> (see ???).</div>

                     <div class="p">A common tie linking these individual manuscripts is that the works are all poems, except for a single prose piece, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-JRILIAD">Translation of <span class="persName-HOMER">Homer</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-ILIAD">Iliad</span></span>, 
                            and even that item could reasonably have been classified as a poem for purposes of inclusion here. 
                            Also, these poetry manuscripts were gathered and bound following publication of <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891">Poems</span> (<span class="date-1891">1891</span>), 
                            possibly because its editor, <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span>, had overlooked the manuscripts altogether or had consulted without identifying them 
                            in his <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems"</span> (see Title). 
                            Given his thorough care in other respects, it seems likely that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> was unacquainted with these manuscripts, 
                            and that they must have surfaced after <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s death, in the course of the literary executors&#x02BC; search of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s study.
                        </div>
                     
                     <div class="p"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> did contain works published by <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>, but he drew on other manuscript versions of those works, 
                            without acknowledging the versions that came to be bound in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>. For example, in his introduction to <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891">Poems</span> (<span class="date-1891">1891</span>), 
                            <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> quotes <span class="title-poem-JRTIMEBLANKVERSE">&#x201C;Time: Blank Verse&#x201D;</span> in its entirety without identifying the source, but variants in the title and line 22 
                            definitely point to <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> as his copytext. Nor were the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> manuscripts included among those in <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span>, 
                            which <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> describes in <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D;</span> as consisting of 
                            &#x201C;an envelope containing loose papers, including poems; fair&#x2010;copied by the author as presents, chiefly to his father; or copied by others&#x201D; 
                            (<span class="title-book-JRPOEMS4D1891">Poems</span> &#x005B;4o, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>&#x005D;, 1:266; <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS8D1891">Poems</span> (8o, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>), 1:268). 
                            While some of the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> manuscripts are inscribed as fair copies made for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s father, 
                            including <span class="title-poem-JRBOSWORTHFIELD">&#x201C;Bosworth Field&#x201D;</span>; probably the trio <span class="title-poem-JRVESUVIUS">&#x201C;Vesuvius&#x201D;</span>, &#x201C;<span class="title-poem-TRAFALGAR">Trafalgar</span>&#x201D;, and <span class="title-poem-JRTHEYEW">&#x201C;The Yew&#x201D;</span> (see Contents, e); and the birthday odes. 
                            One possibility is that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> had simply overlooked these items among the papers at <span class="placeName-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span> when researching his edition. 
                            Meanwhile, in <span class="date-1889">1889</span>, even prior to the publication of <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891">Poems</span> (<span class="date-1891">1891</span>), 
                            <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span> had been bound&#x2014;despite <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</span> description of it as an &#x201C;envelope&#x201D;&#x2014;and the items accidentally omitted were in due course gathered up to form <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>. 
                            (Years later, <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span> was rebound to take account of still other omissions; see <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span>: Date; and <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span>: Description).

                     <div class="p">
                            Another possibility is that the miscellany in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> is not accidental, but reflects some matter of provenance, now unrecoverable. 
                            The seemingly appropriate gathering for these items, <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span>, was a gift by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> to <span class="persName-AW">Alexander Wedderburn</span>; 
                            and <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</span> description of <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span> in his <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note&#x201D;,</span> which fails to take account of a binding added since he wrote the note, 
                            may indicate, not a failure to revise, but limited access. Other language might be construed as a euphemism for the fact that he knew only what <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> chose to tell him about <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span>: 
                            its contents, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> added, &#x201C;are useful as fixing dates in some cases; e.g., the <span class="title-poem-JRNEWYEARS1827">New Year&#x02BC;s Address</span>, <span class="date-1827">1827</span>; and as supplying corrections or additions in other instances&#x201D; 
                            (<span class="title-book-JRPOEMS4D1891">Poems</span> &#x005B;4o, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>&#x005D;, 1:266; <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS8D1891">Poems</span> &#x005B;8o, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>&#x005D;, 1:268). (<span class="title-poem-JRNEWYEARS1827">The &#x201D;New Year&#x02BC;s Address</span>, <span class="date-1827">1827</span>&#x201D;, is <span class="title-poem-JRTHESUN">&#x201C;The Sun&#x201D;</span> which is dated in its <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span> version, and not in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>, which <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> 
                            may have used for copy&#x2010;text.) Similarly, was there some tension concerning ownership and use of the items in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>, items that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> appears not to have consulted at all, 
                            and that by their nature belonged in <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span>, a collection to which he may have allowed only limited access? The suggestion is entirely speculative. It is noteworthy, however, that in the closing paragraph of the 
                            &#x201C;<span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">Preliminary Note</span>&#x201D;, which immediately follows the discussion of <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span>, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> somewhat unnecessarily refers to the &#x201C;excessively rare&#x201D; <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1850">Poems</span> (<span class="date-1850">1850</span>) along with mention of <span class="persName-TJW">T. J. Wise</span>. 
                            It is a reminder that of the atmosphere of the <span class="date-1890-1899">1890s</span>, rife with jealousies and acquisitiveness of book collectors.</div>
