                        Two decades earlier, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself had set the precedent for numbering the 
                        <span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span>, including this one: at bottom of the title page 
                        for “<span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">Eudosia</span>,” he wrote “<span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red book</span> No. 1. 
                        <span class="date-1870-08-09">Sept 8th 1870</span>” (see “<span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">Eudosia</span>”: Title). On the same day, he 
                        docketed <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII"> MS III</span> as “<span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red book</span> No. 2,” and 
                        <span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span> as “<span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red book</span> No. 3.” For the meaning of 
                        this numbering, see Red Books. 
                        Apart from these numerical designations, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs title—intended originally,
                        it appears, both for <span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span> in its entirety as well as for its main work—is 
                        “<span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">EUDOSIA</span> OR / <span class="title-poem-JRPOEMONTHEUNIVERSE">A POEM / ON THE / UNIVERSE </span>/

                  <div class="p">  <span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span> is like some other <span class="title-manuscript-">Red Books</span> 
                        (e.g., <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> and <span class="title-manuscript-MSIIIA">MS IIIA</span>) in that it starts with a title page announcing a single work (see Title) but—<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>
                        failing to realize the ambitious length and predominance of that work—the manuscript was left open to being filled by other kinds of writing. 
                        <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IV</span>, however, was left with an unusually large blank section: from the page containing the
                        final fair‐copied lines of “<span class="title-poem-">Eudosia</span>” 
                        (p. 17) to the <span class="title-manuscript-MINERALOGICALDICTIONARY">Mineralogy Notes</span> [ca. <span class="date-1829">1829</span>] entered reverso from the other end, <span class="title-manuscript-">MS IV</span> 
                        contained a section of 29 leaves, blank except for numbering on some pages, until two decades after its initial use, when 
                        <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> used some of those leaves for his catalog of his sonʼs published poems. 
                        Over time, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> put space in other <span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span> to various uses—the additional poetry anthologies
                        in <span class="title-manuscript-">MS III</span>, the mineralogy notes in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIIIA">MS IIIA</span>
                        (although that <span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Book</span> also retained blank sections extending to significant lengths),
                        the sermon drafts in <span class="title-manuscript-JUVMSA">Juvenilia MS A</span>. That <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> left so much of
                        <span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span> unused may suggest that he persisted longer in an intention to carry on with the manuscriptʼs
                        main work, “<span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">Eudosia</span>,” compared to ambitions for 
                        “<span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">Harry and Lucy</span>,” which he relinquished more easily in 
                        <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> and <span class="title-manuscript-MSIIIA">MS IIIA</span>. 
                        If so, his lingering ambitions for a long poem would be more expected than for Edgeworthian lessons, which he more quickly outgrew.
                        If <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin </span>had devoted additional <span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span> to further “volumes” of 
                        “<span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">Eudosia</span>”—beyond the first volume he planned for 
                        <span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span>, which he gave over to the subject of “Botany”—he presumably 
                        would have continued to follow something like the plan found in his source, <span class="title-poem-LOFFTEUDOSIA">Lofft, Eudosia</span>. 
                        Since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> subdivides his first volume of his “<span class="title-poem-JRPOEMONTHEUNIVERSE">Poem on the Universe</span>” into “books” 
                        (of which he never got beyond the start of book 2), he is even more ambitious than <span class="persName-CL">Lofft</span>, whose “<span class="title-poem-LOFFTEUDOSIA">Poem on the Universe</span>” is divided 
                        only into books (not volumes containing books), of which the first is “The Earth,” corresponding to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskinʼs</span> “Botany.”
                        It is possible that one of the fair‐copy versions of “<span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations: Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and Some of the 
                            Southern</span>”—that in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>, or <span class="title-manuscript-RFT70">RF T70</span>—
                        represents a continuation of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs scheme beyond the first volume in 
                        <span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span>, as a volume on the stars would correspond to <span class="persName-CL">Lofft</span>ʼs
                        poem: see <a href="/apparatuses/eudosia_apparatus#DISCUSSION" target="_self">“Eudosia”: Discussion</a>.</div>
