                  <div class="p">Above the first line of the first four stanzas of draft in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> (pp. 1–2), <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> inserted the title, <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> in pencil, 
                        although he composed the draft itself in ink, suggesting that he considered the title to be tentative. 
                        He was apparently having difficulty making up his mind. 
                        On the back endpaper of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, he wrote a note to himself clearly referring to the fifth stanza of <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span>, 
                        in which he names the poem “Persiad”—no doubt an invention that refers to the poemʼs subject of the <span class="date--0499--0449">Persian Wars</span>. 
                        This title, using the classical suffix, complements <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs title for his earlier epic poem, 
                        <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">“Iteriad”</span></a>.
                     </div> 
                  
                  <div class="p">The title appears to have remained tentative at least until <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> reached the draft of the tenth stanza in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, 
                        where he boldly wrote <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> 
                        above the stanza in ink, with no indication that he inserted this title later than the draft itself 
                        (stanzas 10–12 composed <span class="date-1831-12-01-1832-01-31">between December 1831 and January 1832</span>; see <a href="DATE">Date</a>). 
                        Nonetheless, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> used no title for his fair copy in <a href="/" target="_self">MS V</a>, which he made shortly after completing draft of the first eighteen stanzas, 
                        toward the end of <span class="date-1832-01">January 1832</span>. The fair copy in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>, which is probably earlier, made in <span class="date-1831-12">December 1831</span>, likewise lacks a title contemporary with its production 
                        (see <a href="COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</a>). Both of these fair copies carry the title <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> in pencil, 
                        but the hand is probably <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span>ʼs from a much later time, when he was preparing his edition, 
                        <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRACCOUNTTOUR1891"><i>Poems</i> (1891)</span></a>.

                  <div class="p">Of the fair copies, only <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span> presents a title. Even this manuscriptʼs elaborate title page (59r) leaves options partly open, however, 
                        by naming the work “ATHENS / or the”, with the subtitle left incomplete, and with the ornamented lettering for <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“ATHENS”</span> 
                        left incompletely traced in ink over top of the penciled design. 
                        (The design matches that for the title page of

                        date this poem broadly but correctly as <span class="date-1831-1832">1831–32</span> 
                        (<a href="/" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 2: 537).

                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs progress in composing <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> can be dated reasonably closely since he entered stanzas intermittently in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> relative to other dateable poems 
                        in the <span class="date-1831-1832">1831–33</span> section of this notebook. His composition of this mix of <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> stanzas along with shorter poems appears sequential, 
                        but caveats are justified in places, which would complicate the chronology  
                        (see <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>: Contents, Section <i>a</i></a>).
                    </div>
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> probably started work on <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> in late <span class="date-1831-08-1831">August or September 1831</span>, 
                        given that the first portion of draft in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, stanzas 1–4, precedes a section of 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">“Iteriad”</span>, book 4, lines 297–320, which he likely composed in <span class="date-1831-09">September</span>. Previously, he had been drafting <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">“Iteriad”</span> in another notebook, 
                        <span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span>, which is likewise devoted to rough draft, and in which he refers to <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> as the “new manuscript” 
                        (see <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">“Iteriad”</span>: Date</a> and 
                        <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">“Iteriad”</span>: Composition and Publication</a>). 
                        In <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, however, the <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">“Iteriad”</span> draft appears neatly self‐contained on its page (p. 3), 
                        an appearance suggesting the possibility that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> entered this passage in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> first, 
                        and then wrapped the other poetry (including the opening <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> stanzas) 
                        on pp. 1–2 and pp. 4–6 around it. Even so, this possibility might affect the chronology only in throwing the <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">“Iteriad”</span> draft 
                        back in time prior to the Ruskin familyʼs departure for the <a href="/" target="_self">Tour of 1831</a> 
                        to <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span>. On their return, 
                     <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> reflects on that experience in many of the poems of

                  <div class="p">The first poem in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> to be dated explicitly in the manuscript is

                        which <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> glossed as “Oct”. Since the poem falls on p. 5, following both the opening <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> stanzas and the <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">“Iteriad”</span> draft, 
                        an October date tends to confirm August or September for the inception of <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span>. 
                        <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs gloss, however, may refer to a revision of this poem a year later; see the details about the

                        (p. 14), which he could have composed anytime between <span class="date-1831-12-1832-01">December 1831 and January 1832</span>. 
                        Thus, after beginning <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> in <span class="date-1831-08-1831-09">August or September 1831</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> returned to the poem by the end of the year or start of the next.

                        Stanza 19 is succeeded by drafts of three more poems

                        <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTWELVEMONTHSALLROLLINGROUND">“Twelve months all rolling round have past”</span></a> (pp. 31–37). 
                        How far in advance of that anniversary <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was working cannot be established with certainty, 
                        except that the possible period of composition for all these poems, starting with stanza 19 of “Athens”, stretches from <span class="date-1832-02-1832-05-10">mid‐February to May 10</span>.

                  <div class="p">Finally, there follows a cluster formed by the last known stanzas of <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> to be composed (or, at least, the last to have survived) mixed with a few other poems: 
                        stanzas 20–21 (pp. 37–38), which are followed by three miscellaneous poems 
                        (<a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRASPICEPATERINVOCATIONEM">“Aspice pater invocationem”</span></a> [p. 38],

                        and then by one final, unnumbered stanza (p. 41). Possible fault lines run before and after this cluster, or even between poems within the cluster, 
                        which would open up differing scenarios for dating. The most likely scenario, however, is that this final cluster belongs to the same period, 
                        <span class="date-1832-02-15-1832-05-15">mid‐February to mid‐May</span>, that also comprises the preceding cluster starting with stanza 19 and leading up to draft of the birthday poem for <span class="persName-">John James</span>.

                        on its other end, by

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> dated the latter as <span class="date-1832-09">September 1832</span>, for it refers to the death of

                        The intervening gap of time was filled in part by the <a href="/" target="_self">Tour of 1832</a>, 
                        a family holiday in <span class="placeName-DOVER">Dover</span> and <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span>, which extended from <span class="date-1832-05-22-1832-07-19">22 May through 19 July</span>. At what point respecting this final <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> cluster did the holiday intervene?

                  <div class="p">The physical evidence is inconclusive. 
                        It is reassuring for the larger picture thus far formed of 
                        <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>: Contents, Section <i>a</i></a> 
                        that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> revised his page numbering system immediately following this final cluster of <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> installments. 
                        From the start of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, he had numbered versos with odd numbers, 
                        but he changed to the more conventional numbering of rectos with odd numbers starting with p. 45, by omitting a p. 44 
                        (see <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>: Description</a>). 
                        This facing‐page spread of p. 43 and p. 45 contains 
                        <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRSONGIWEARY">“Song” (“I weary for the torrent leaping”</span>)</a>, 
                        and the previous spread, pp. 41–42, contains the final, unnumbered stanza of <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> followed by the <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span> elegy. 
                        Had <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> changed his numbering on the latter spread, pp. 41–42, one would be more confident in asserting that the gap in time fell here, 
                        dividing the <span class="date-1832-09">September 1832</span> elegy from the final stanza of <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span>—and indeed, the <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> stanza 
                        appears written using a different pen and/or ink than the poems surrounding it on that spread.
                    </div> 
                  
                  <div class="p">All in all, two possibilities seem most likely. One is to locate the two‐month gap on pp. 41–42, 
                        despite <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs change in numbering coming afterward, on the spread formed by p. 43 and p. 45, 
                        since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did indicate at least an awareness of the numbering anomaly on the preceding spread, pp. 39–40, 
                        where he marked the recto page number 40 either by striking through the zero or by overwriting it with a numeral 1 
                        (see <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>: Description</a>). 
                        Since the poem on this spread, 
                        <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHEYWOKETHEMFROMTHEIRCOUCH">“They woke them from their couch of rest”</span></a>, 
                        spills over onto p. 41 (verso), followed by the unnumbered <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> stanza, 
                        the physical evidence of that flagged numeral 40 lends some credence to interpreting the following spread as the watershed, 
                        dividing the final <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> stanza from the <span class="date-1832-09">September</span> elegy by the gap representing 
                        <a href="/" target="_self">Tour of 1832</a>.
                    </div> 
                  
                  <div class="p">That same evidence of the flagged numeral 40 also supports a second interpretation, 
                        identifying <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHEYWOKETHEMFROMTHEIRCOUCH">“They woke them from their couch of rest”</span></a> 
                        (pp. 39–41) as the first poem in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> on the far side of the summer journey, 
                        along with the lone, unnumbered <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> stanza (p. 41) and the <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span> elegy (pp. 41–42). 
                        This interpretation is supported not only by the physical evidence, which situates <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs first flagging of the numbering anomaly at the point of homecoming, 
                        but also by the content of 
                        <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHEYWOKETHEMFROMTHEIRCOUCH">“They woke them from their couch of rest”</span></a>, 
                        which is a poem about the Scottish highlands. It is written in a distinctly darker ink and using a blunter pen than 
                        <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRLLYNIDWAL">“Llyn Idwal”</span></a> (pp. 38–39), 
                        which is a poem about <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span>, and which is written in a lighter and finer pen and ink. 
                        This second interpretation divides the final known <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> stanza, which is titled <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> but unnumbered, 
                        from the previous <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> stanzas 20–21, which are both titled and numbered in the manuscript. 
                        These stanzas on pp. 37–38 are also composed in the same lighter, finer pen and ink as that used for 
                        <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRASPICEPATERINVOCATIONEM">“Aspice pater invocationem”</span></a> (p. 38)

                  <div class="p">The appeal of the second interpretation is that, by placing the <a href="/" target="_self">Tour of 1832</a> 
                        on pp. 39–40, between <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRLLYNIDWAL">“Llyn Idwal”</span></a> (pp. 38–39) and  
                        <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHEYWOKETHEMFROMTHEIRCOUCH">“They woke them from their couch of rest”</span></a>, 
                        one perceives a separation between the Welsh scenery that had dominated the poems written between <span class="date-1831-08-1832-05">August‐September 1831 and May 1832</span>, 
                        hearkening back to the <a href="/" target="_self">Tour of 1831</a>,
                        and the Scottish and Lake District scenery that dominated the poems written after <span class="date-1832-07-1832-08">July or August 1832</span>—including the poem or poems marking <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>ʼs death. 
                        By situating the final known stanza of “Athens” among the latter, this reading hypothesizes the briefest renewal of the project—the unnumbered 
                        stanza possibly signaling a start on a second canto just prior to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs abandoning the poem for good.

                  <div class="p">The purpose of the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> copy may be indicated by its probable dating of <span class="date-1831-12">December</span>, suggesting the intention of a

                        The works itself is obviously not an occasional poem of this kind, however, and no other such presentation is known in <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs hand. 
                        Typically, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> produced fair copies to send to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> while he was traveling, 
                        but no family letters survive between <span class="date-1831-05-1832-01-15">May 1831 and mid‐January 1832</span> to help confirm this possible purpose.
                    </div>
                  
                  <div class="p">The fair copy in <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> was made by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, and it contains seventeen stanzas, numbered by him. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> cannot have started making this copy earlier than 
                        the fair copy of <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRSONNETTOACLOUD">“Sonnet to a Cloud”</span></a>, 
                        which precedes the fair copy of <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> in <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>. In <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft, this <span class="title-poem-JRSONNETTOACLOUD">“Sonnet”</span> falls between the draft of <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> stanzas 10–12 and 
                        the draft of stanzas 13–18—the whole of this segment of this draft of stanzas 10–18 being attributed to between <span class="date-1831-12-1832-01">December 1831 to January 1832</span>. 
                        That <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> made this <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> fair copy of <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> immediately following draft composition through stanza 18 
                        accords well with what follows the fair copy in <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>—namely, 
                        <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRSONNETTOTHEMORNING">“Sonnet to the Morning”</span></a>, 
                        which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> dated <span class="date-1832-02-05">5 February [1832]</span> in its <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft, and 
                        <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHESONGOFTHESOUTHERNBREEZE">“The Song of the Southern Breeze”</span></a>, 
                        which he dated <span class="date-1832-02-12">12 February [1832]</span> in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>. Tending to confirm this reconstruction of the sequence of drafting and fair copying, stanza 19 of <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span>, 
                        which is not included in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> version, 
                        appears in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft immediately following 
                        <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTHESONGOFTHESOUTHERNBREEZE">“The Song of the Southern Breeze”</span></a>. 
                        Thus, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> resumed draft soon after he had completed the <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> fair copy of the first 18 stanzas.
                    </div>
                  
                  <div class="p">The discrepancy between the total number of seventeen stanzas in <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> and the eighteen available in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> up to the point of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs fair‐copying 
                        is explained by the <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> version having dropped the fifth stanza of the draft in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, 
                        causing the sixth stanza of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> to become the fifth in <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>. 
                        Thereafter, the stanza numbering in <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> always lags behind <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> by one. 
                        The final stanza to be fair‐copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>, <span class="title-poem-JRXVII">“XVII”</span>, is thus the eighteenth stanza of draft in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>. 
                        The missing stanza is present in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> and in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span>.
                    </div> 
                  
                  <div class="p">In <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, one stanza, originally the sixth, was completely cancelled. 
                        This, however, is not the stanza dropped from <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>, and the cancellation has no necessary bearing on the other discrepancies between the two versions. 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself may or may not have been responsible for this cancellation. 
                        The stanza is scored in pencil, perhaps by the same hand that had penciled in a word in that same stanza—a hand that appears closer to <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs than <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs.
                    </div>
                  
                  <div class="p">If <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> made her <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> copy in <span class="date-1831-12">December 1831</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> made his soon afterward, in <span class="date-1832-01">January 1832</span>; 
                        and in both copies the poem remained untitled. 
                        (Again, the title appears in pencil, but in the same hand, probably <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs, that docketed the copy in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>.) 
                        Each of these versions contains minor variants in wording and punctuation compared to the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft, 
                        and these variants are peculiar to their respective manuscripts, showing no influence of one on the other. 
                        This independence is very clear in the final stanza to be copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>, stanza 7, 
                        in which <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> followed the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft much more closely than did <span class="persName-JJR">John</span> in <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>. 
                        Nonetheless, it is clear that <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> uses the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft as copytext for the first seven stanzas, not the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> copy 
                        (see <a href="#TEXTUALNOTE">Textual Note</a>).
                    </div>
                  
                  <div class="p">The missing fifth stanza in <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> appears to have involved some struggle in composition. 
                        In <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>ʼs <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> fair copy, the ninth line of the fifth stanza reads: “But wake not those below their foam who lie” 
                        (<i>their</i> referring to the ocean “billows”).
                        Beneath “wake”, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> penciled in an alternate version of the line, “them—they sleep eternally”. 
                        The alternate revives a version of the line that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had rejected in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft: 
                        “But wake not <span class="del-strikethrough"> them they sleep eternally</span>”, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> replacing the deletion with “those below their foam who lie” inserted above the line. 
                        On the back endpaper of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> dwelled on the issue with a memorandum: 
                        “For line 9th Verse 5th Persiad (But wake not those below <span class="del-strikethrough">its breast who</span> their foam that lie”—with 
                        “their foam that” added to replace the deletion. No evidence settles the enticing question of whether the difficulty with this line 
                        caused <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> to omit the fifth stanza from <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> altogether. 
                        In <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span>, he accepted what may have been his motherʼs preference: “But wake not them: They sleep eternally”. 
                        He also carried on with the fair‐copying for only four more lines into the sixth stanza, before abandoning this version.
                    </div>
                  
                  <div class="p">Beyond the <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> version, which is the longest of the fair‐copy texts, the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft carries on for four more stanzas. 
                        These were never fair‐copied, so far as we know. The final stanza to be composed in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> stands alone, and it is unnumbered. 
                        Its generalized descriptive content gives no indication about where in the epic it should fit. 
                        Its first line, “The sunset shone upon the isles of Greece”, reads like a new opening. 
                        Perhaps <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> thought of the stanza as the opening of a projected second canto.

                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> cannot have commenced the fair copy in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span> earlier than the preceding fair copy of

                        when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> he put his final orthographical flourish to the “Finis” 
                        (see <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">“Iteriad”</span>: Date</a>). 
                        Even then, the task remained of adding the “notes” to the earlier poem, 
                        as he admitted in a <a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1832-01-14_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-jr_to_jjr_1832-01-14"><span class="date-1832-01-14">14 January 1832</span> letter</span></a>, promising to append them “in such a style that the company shall stare” 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 259).
                    </div>
                  
                  <div class="p">By the time he finished fair‐copying <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">“Iteriad”</span> in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span>, therefore, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had probably completed the first eighteen stanzas of draft for <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span>, 
                        which he used as copytext for the <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> version. Since he fair‐copied the latter in <span class="date-1832-01-15-1832-02-14">late January or early February 1832</span>, 
                        shortly following the drafting of the poem through that point, 
                        logic suggests that he started the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span> version no earlier than his resumption of the draft with stanza 19, after <span class="date-1832-02-12">12 February 1832</span>. 
                        By this time, he was able to head his fair copy with at least a partial title.
                    </div>
                  
                  <div class="p">How long after mid‐February <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have started this new fair copy cannot be determined with physical or textual evidence. 
                        He fair‐copied only five stanzas and the first four lines of the sixth, and the punctuation variants bear little relation to the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> and <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> versions. 
                        The most significant variant is the inclusion in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span> of the fifth stanza in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> draft, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> omitted from the <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> fair copy. Again, 
                        logic suggests that <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span> is a later version than <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>, in that <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span> makes this correction (and extends the text only so far as to confirm this correction). 
                        Admittedly, the window of time available in the <span class="date-1832-01-15-1832-01-31">second half of January</span> might allow a hypothesis of the <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span> version as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs preferred text, 
                        deliberately excluding the fifth stanza that he had already fair‐copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span>. 
                        This scenario seems unlikely, however, since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was in fact sorely pressed for time to fit in his many activities. 
                        If in his “former letters, the great subject is want of time”, he wrote to his father on <a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1832-02-20_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-jr_to_jjr_1832-02-20"><span class="date-1832-02-20">20 February 1832</span></span></a>, 
                        he found “it now still more scarce than ever for what with [his lessons in] <span class="persName-LIVY">Livy</span>, and <span class="persName-LUCIAN">Lucian</span>, <span class="persName-HOMER">Homer</span>, French, Drawing, Arithmetic, globe work, & mineralogical dictionary, 
                        I positively am all flurry, all hurry, never a moment in which there is not something that ought to be done”. 
                        As for poetry, he was “sorry to inform” his father on <a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1832-02-27_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-jr_to_jjr_1832-02-27"><span class="date-1832-02-27">27 February</span></span></a> that, since <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> had been away from home traveling for orders 
                        (since <span class="date-1832-02-19">19 February</span>, at the latest), <span class="persName-fictional_person-PEGASUS">Pegasus</span> had “flown so high, that I am unable to follow it, & the reinless <span class="persName-fictional_person-PEGASUS">Pegaus</span> has left me hurled from his too lofty back

                        again I shall ride on the Pegasian wing”

                  <div class="p">Even when <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> returned home, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poetry composition and appear to have been checked,

                        and the version of the poem in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> apparently representing a collaborative composition between father and son

                        Fair‐copying, too, evidently became mired. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not continue any fair‐copying at all in <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>, beyond <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> and the two following poems,

                  <div class="p">While it is possible, therefore, that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have taken up <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> in its <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span> fair copy well after the period of the poemʼs composition, 
                        which appears to have been arrested prior to the familyʼs departure for <span class="placeName-DOVER">Dover</span> on <span class="date-1832-05-22">22 May 1832</span>, 
                        the <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span> versionʼs state of incompletion combined with increasing ambition—the verso of its incomplete title page 
                        announcing in light pencil the division, “Canto First” (59v), and the facing page declaring in light pencil “THE ARGUMENT” (60r), 
                        which was never added—suggest that this collapse in plans belongs to the same period as the other fragmented projects in the <span class="date-1832-01-1832-05">first five months of 1832</span>. 
                        This interpretation seems consistent with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs possible message in 
                        <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRASPICEPATERINVOCATIONEM">“Aspice pater invocationem”</span></a>, 
                        composed as part of the final cluster containing <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> draft—stanzas 20–21 and the final unnumbered stanza. 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs meaning in this Latin poem is obscure, but he appears to beg his father for a new “quarto”—that is, possibly, for a new notebook or ledger,

                        The Latin poem does not mention <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> specifically, but its classical epic style (“Aspice, pater, invocationem”) 
                        suggests that he wanted a fresh notebook in order to fair‐copy his new epic. 
                        Apparently, he did not receive this “boon”, since he used <span class="title-manuscript-MSVII">MS VII</span> itself to begin his new fair copy.

                        his <span class="title-poem-ILIAD"><i>Iliad</i></span>. The poem draws on the events of <span class="persName-XERXES">Xerxes</span>ʼs great march on <span class="placeName-ATHENS">Athens</span> and the <span class="date--0490">Battle of Marathon</span>. 
                        The primary ancient source narrating these events, <span class="persName-HERODOTUS">Herodotus</span>ʼs <span class="title-book-HERODOTUSHISTORIES"><i>Histories</i></span>, 
                        is not mentioned in the poem, which reflects little knowledge of its Herodotean subject.

                        Even more peculiarly, in the middle stanzas, 12–16, 
                        the style veres markedly from the Byronic to the Wordsworthian, showing the influence of <span class="title-poem-WORDSWORTHTHEEXCURSION"><i>The Excursion</i></span> in general, 
                        and of <span class="title-poem-WORDSWORTHTHEBROTHERS">“The Brothers”</span> in particular. While the influence of <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span>ʼs shorter poems can be detected in some earlier poems by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        (e.g., the line, “My heart leaps up when I behold”, <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTOMYHEART">“To My Heart”</span></a>), 
                        valuable evidence of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs first engagement with <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span> may be more apparent in <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">“Athens”</span> 
                        than in the Cumbrian travel poem, <span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">“Iteriad”</span>.
