                  <div class="p"><a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-REDBOOK"></span>Red Book</a>; 9.8 × 15.2 cm; 38 leaves (counting from Yaleʼs bookplate, and including final leaf or endpaper, which has been partially glued to back board), of which 2r–15r numbered by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> as pp. 1–29; watermark <span class="date-1823">1823</span>. The leaf 31r–v has been attached to 30v with tape, and a stub along the inside margin of 31v shows that a leaf has been torn out. Following 31v, the gathering 32r–37v is loose and could be missing outermost leaves.
                       The inside front board is blank except for Yaleʼs  bookplate and, unlike the other <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-REDBOOK"></span>Red Books</a> in the slipcase <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">Harry & Lucy</span>, does not have glued or tipped in a brief description of the notebook penned by <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>(?) with a clipping from PJR. <span class="title-manuscript-MSIIIA">MS IIIA</span> was never described by the earlier editors, however, neither in PJR nor in Works. <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>, or whoever was responsible for slipcasing the juvenilia, was evidently content to include <span class="title-manuscript-MSIIIA">MS IIIA</span> in the <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">Harry and Lucy</span> slipcase, where it logically belonged.
                       Title page (1r):  <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">HARRY AND LUCY</span> / CONCLUDED / BEING / THE LAST PART / OF / EARLY LESSONS / BY / <span class="persName-JR">JOHN RUSKIN</span>/ IN FOUR VOLUMES / VOL III / HERNHILL / DULWICH.  On back of the title page (1v), <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> imitated a printed page of  ERRATA. 
                       Unlike the  <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">Harry and Lucy</span>  narratives in <span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span> and <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">III</span>, this volume of the tale is written entirely in ink; however, this volume contains no  plates,  for which pencil had been reserved in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>, even when the text was ink. Later in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIIIA">MS IIIA</span>, the mineralogy notes and sermon draft are written in pencil.
                       The pages following  <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">Harry and Lucy</span>  that are blank except for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin's</span> page numbering (pp. 10–29) must have been intended for the continuation of the narrative, since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> prepared the pages in the same way as pp. 1–9—i.e., with verticle rules in pencil near the inside and outside margins, serving as guides to  justify <span class="persName-JR">Ruskinʼs</span> printing.
                        <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> misdated <span class="title-manuscript-MSIIIA">MS IIIA</span> as autumn <span class="date-1828">1828</span>, <span class="date-182930">1829-30</span>, <span class="date-1832">1832</span>. The mineralogy notes, no. 172, are presumably no earlier than the note on payment for the <span class="persName-HOMER">Homer</span> and for  mineralogy articles,  which precedes the notes written from the end of the volume. Payment for <span class="persName-HOMER">Homer</span> must refer to translating the <span class="title-poem-">Iliad</span> (no. 160a) in <span class="date-1832-02-27">late February 1832</span>:  But <span class="persName-HOMER">Homer</span>! I am happy to inform you, sir, that I have translated about 550 lines of the first book. . . . These however I do suppose are news to you extremely unwelcome—unwelcome owing to what <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> will have to pay (<a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1832-02-27_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-jr_to_jjr_1832-02-27">letter of <span class="date-1832-02-27">27 February 1832</span></span></a> [<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a> 268–69]). The following mineralogy notes were entered considerably later, I believe, probably after December <span class="date-1832">1832</span> (see note to no. 172). Finally, following the mineralogical notes, the rough draft of the eighteenth <span class="title-sermon-JRSERMONSONTHEPENTATEUCH">Sermon on the Pentateuch</span> could have been entered anytime in <span class="date-1833">1833</span> after sermons <span class="title-manuscript-">VIII-X</span> were drafted early in that year (see nos. 174-75).</div>

                  <div class="p">Forward from front of book:
                        a) Following title page (1r), a list of  errata  (1v).
                        b) Vol. 3 of  <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">Harry and Lucy</span>,  no. 32 (pp. 1–9 [2r–6r]). The end of the narrative (pp. 7–9 [5r–6r]), is nearly identical to its draft in <span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span>. The fair‐copy text is broken off in the middle of a sentence.
                        c) Blank pp. 10–11 (6v–7r), presumably left open for continuation of <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">Harry and Lucy</span>, never completed.
                        d) Mineralogy notes, no. 172 (pp. 12–15 [7v–9r]), later composed on pp. originally set aside for continuation of  <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">Harry and Lucy</span>. These notes appear roughly contemporaneous with j below.
                        e) Blank, 9v–24v (9v–15r numbered by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> pp. 16–29, and 15v–23v left completely blank).
                        f) List of minerals keyed to numbers of unknown significance (24r).
                        g) Blank, 24v–25r.
                        Forward from back of book:
                        h) Mineral list, no. 186 (38r).
                        i) List of payments to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> (37v):
                        s.	d
                        To	80 Lines composition.	0	4
                        To	8. min. articles.		0	8
                        To	2. Pages homer		2.	0
                        _______
                        3.	0
                        To	2 ditto			2.	0
                        Lent					2.	6
                        _______
                        Paid	1.	6 
                        Presumably, the total paid is crossed out, because <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had short-changed himself a shilling. According to no. 148, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was getting a halfpenny per line for his  greek  in late <span class="date-1831">1831</span> and early <span class="date-1832">1832</span>, presumably for his translation of the <span class="title-poem-">Iliad</span> (see no. 160a). It is not clear what  lines  he is counting, but 24 lines to earn a shilling for a  page  appears a likely equation.
                            From this sum, we also discover that a mineralogical  article  earned a penny, and, at least at this time, poetry composition was paid a farthing per five lines of poetry (see no. 91).
                            j) Mineralology notes (36v, 35v, 34v), no. 172. These notes alternate with blank pages (37r, 36r, 35r, 34r; 37r contains a few words).
                            k) Draft of sermon 18, no. 182 (32v, 31v, 30v, 29v, 28v, 27v, 26v, 25v). As in j, the draft pages alternate with blank pages (32r, 30r, 29r, 28r, 27r, 26r).
                            l) Pen and ink sketch of group of trees on an outcropping of rock (31r, undatable).
