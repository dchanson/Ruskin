                  <div class="p">Influenced by Ruskin's charming account in Praeterita of having written this Byronic Venician tale to please Adèle Domecq (Works 35:180), editors have always ascribed "Leoni" to early 1836, when the girls visited Herne Hill.  Its position in MS VIII does warrant that date; however, like the preceding Venice poem no. 210 (which “Leoni” follows in the middle of a page), this tale can be ascribed to a range of possible dates, starting in summer and fall 1835.  Thus we cannot rule out the possibility that in the character Giuletta Ruskin had already sketched what he came to see in Adèle. But an early 1836 date remains likely, if only because this section of MS VIII would seem by now to contain too much writing for Ruskin still to be working in 1835.
                        Ruskin was still working on the tale in June 1836, when John and John James were corresponding with W. H. Harrison about its publication in Friendship's Offering for 1837 (RFL 459 n. 2); however, this initial draft must be earlier, since it is followed by poems dateable to the early months of 1836 (see no. 217 and following).
