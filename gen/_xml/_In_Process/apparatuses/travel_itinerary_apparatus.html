                  <div class="p">Before <span class="date-1828-05-1828-07">May and through mid‐July 1828</span>. The two lists of itineraries (see <a href="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</a>) can be dated only approximately, 
                        owing to the failure of any family letters to survive from <span class="date-1828">1828</span>, except for a New Yearʼs address dated from the last day of the year 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="title-book-RFL">RFL</span></a> 170‐71). One letter ascribed to earlier in <span class="date-1828">1828</span>, a poem for <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs birthday, is an error in <span class="title-book-RFL">RFL</span> (see no. 41); 
                        therefore, we cannot be certain that the family departed <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> following <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs May 10 birthday. 
                        Some dates in May through July can be attached to the actual tour. The prospective list would have been compiled prior to departure, 
                        of course, presumably at a time when <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> was at home to help annotate the list.</div>

                  <div class="p">Portion reproduced in <a href="/notes/bibliography#HUNTWIDERSEA" target="_self"><span class="persName-JDHUNT">Hunt</span>, <span class="title-book-HUNTWIDERSEA"><i>John Ruskin: A Wider Sea</i></span></a>, fig. 6a. 
                        Quoted in <a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 1:xxv‐xxvi n. 2. Previously unpublished in entirety.</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">See <a href="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</a> for the genesis of the travel plans. <span class="title-manuscript-MSIVB">MS IVB</span> contains two itineraries, one at the front of the notebook, and the other at the back, 
                        consisting of lists of city names, sometimes annotated with sightseeing features to be found in those towns and cities.</div>
                  
                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-HGV">Helen Viljoen</span> interpreted the itinerary at the front of the <span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Book</span> as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs prospective plan with annotations by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, 
                        and the list at the end as notes taken during the actual trip (“Dating MSS. of Boyhood,” HGVP, boxes D.V, E.IX). 
                        <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span>ʼs interpretation is supported by the prospective list being printed neatly in ink by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        (longhand annotations by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>), while the notes for the actual tour are more roughly written in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs ink longhand.</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">Thus, it appears, sometime prior to departure, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> devised the list of prospective places by dividing pages in half horizontally, 
                        and labeling each half‐page with a place name. Most sections were then annotated by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> with features of special interest, 
                        obviously drawing on some guidebook, and, one imagines, consulting with his wife and son.</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">Later, during the journey itself, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> listed merely the names of places they visited, the swing back to <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> occurring soon after arriving in <span class="placeName-PLYMOUTH">Plymouth</span>, 
                        where the family learned of <span class="persName-JRP">Aunt Jessie</span>ʼs death.</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">Some years later, the lists became densely crowded by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs mineralogy notes, written reverso from the other end of the notebook (see no. 171; and part 2, <span class="title-manuscript-MSIVB">MS IVB</span>, “Content”).</div>
