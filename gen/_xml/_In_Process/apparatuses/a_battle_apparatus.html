                  <div class="p">A presentation copy in <span class="title-manuscript-MSXI">MS XI</span> dated <span class="date-1828-12-31">31 December 1828</span> precisely corresponds to
                        an 89‐line “irregular measure” poem that, according to <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">“Harry and Lucy”</span> (no.
                        32), <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span> is struggling to finish for New Yearʼs, on the subject of “battle
                        between the Pretender or Chevalier as <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span> would have him called and the
                        forces or part of the forces of George the 2<sup>nd</sup>” (<span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span>). <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> is
                        critical of <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> for ascribing this poem to <span class="date-1828">1828</span>, rather than
                        to <span class="date-1829-01-01">New Yearʼs 1829</span>; however, they were correct if they meant the very end of
                        <span class="date-1828">1828</span>.</div>

                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was taxed by the presentation copy of the poem, since, according to
                        <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">“Harry and Lucy,”</span> “all the poems that he had hitherto presented to his
                        father were printed in what <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span> called single letter . . . but <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">harry</span>
                        printed this double print” (<span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span>; to be precise, in earlier productions, he
                        had used the “double print” for capital letters, but not for an entire
                        poem). He also planned to enliven the presentation with a puppet show of the
                        battle (see no. 35).</div>

                  <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs account of this skirmish, as <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> notes, is based on chapter 59
                        of <span class="title-book-SCOTTWAVERLEY"><i>Waverley</i></span>, in which the English capture <span class="persName-fictional-FERGUSMACIVOR">Fergus MacIvor</span> at <span class="placeName-">Clifton</span> (<a href="/notes/bibliography#VILJOENRUSKINSBACKGROUNDS" target="_self"><span class="title-book-VILJOENRUSKINSBACKGROUNDS">RSH</span></a>,
                        202 n.1), an event that had likewise occurred in late December. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> makes
                        the poem as much a Lakeland as a battle piece, the armies ranging along
                        <span class="geogName-DERWENT">Derwent</span> and their clamor echoing from <span class="geogName-SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</span>; and, to gain those effects,
                        he apparently misplaces the battle in the <span class="placeName-CLIFTON">Clifton</span> on the <span class="geogName-DERWENT">Derwent</span>, rather
                        than in the <span class="placeName-CLIFTON">Clifton</span> between <span class="placeName-PENRITH">Penrith</span> and <span class="placeName-SHAP">Shap</span>.</div>
                  
                  <div class="p">In fair copy, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> numbered every fifth line. The first four lines of <span class="title-poem-JRABATTLEIRREGULARMEASURE">“A
                        Battle”</span> turn up later in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> as <span class="title-poem-JRTHESUMMITOFSKIDDAW">“A Fragment”</span> (no. 51).</div>
