         1.2. Title
         In the earlier of two surviving fair copies of the poem (see Manuscripts), RF T70, Ruskin centered “THE CONSTELLATIONS” above the column of lines. Then, in what appears an afterthought, he added “NORTHERN” to the right in the margin, on the baseline of the main title; and on a second line
                  below “NORTHERN”, he placed, awkwardly, in the margin to the right of the opening lines of the poem,
                  “SOME OF THE ZODIAC / AND SOME OF THE SOUTHERN”.
         While the addition of the trailing lines to the first fair‐copy subtitle might be
                  explained as pacing Ruskinʼs composition of the poem—that is, his elaboration of the subtitle as he added constellations
                  from across the hemispheres—this possibility conflicts with the existence of a prior
                  draft. The belated additions could suggest, however, that Ruskin came to understand the hemispheric positions of the constellations only after he
                  first drafted the poem. As discussed in “The Constellations” as Marking a Stage of Astronomical Education, this inference is probably too extreme—contradicted, for example, by his clustering,
                  more or less, of constellation groups within the poem, such as the northern circumpolar
                  constellations and the Zodiac constellations. Nonetheless, the evolving title does testify broadly to “The Constellations” as a marker of Ruskinʼs developing understanding and his desire to represent that development textually
                  and materially. The revision to the title may also have posed one motive for giving
                  up on this fair‐copy manuscript, RF T70, and using the same sheet to revise some of its lines (see Composition and Publication).
         In the second surviving fair copy, in MS III, Ruskin incorporated his revisions to the first fair copy, including allowing space to center
                  the subtitle properly below the main title and above the first line, breaking the
                  three lines as “THE CONSTELLATIONS / NORTHERN, SOME OF THE ZODIAC AND / SOME OF THE SOUTHERN”.
         The fragment of draft of the poem, bound in MS IA, lacks a title. Since the (unnumbered) lines in this manuscript start with line 27
                  as fair‐copied, presumably a sheet containing draft of preceding lines has been lost,
                  which may have included a title. The first state of the title, if any, is therefore
                  unknown, and we can only speculate about its relation to the apparent expansion of
                  the subtitle in the first fair copy. See MS IA: Collation of the Original Bound Manuscript.

         1.4.1. MS IA
         An apparently fragmentary manuscript, “cepheus and bootes now” is a 12.5 × 20 cm vertically folded sheet, written on all four sides in pencil, cursive
                     hand, with some substitutions written in ink, cursive hand. Although unsigned, and
                     the hand described as “unidentifed” in the finding aid of the Beinecke Library John Ruskin Collection, the hand is distinctly John Ruskinʼs early cursive.
         The manuscript probably was bound into into MS IA by Cook and Wedderburn. Like the other contents of this miscellaneous collection, this item was separated
                     from its binding, whether prior to or as a result of Charles Goodspeedʼs house fire. See MS IA: Collation of the Original Manuscript and MS IA: Contents, b. Presently, at the Beinecke Library, the manuscript is catalogued as part of the John Ruskin Collection, Series II: Manuscripts, 1826–1897, subseries Unbound Manuscripts, “The Monastery—Manuscript, in an unidentified hand, of passages of verse, undated”. This identification
                     is mistaken: the folded sheet of “Constellations” draft has been collected together with a fragment of “Monastery” draft, which resembles the former in its paper and pencil cursive hand, and the collection
                     misidentified as consisting solely of manuscript of “The Monastery”. The two projects were closely aligned, however; see Composition and Publication.
         
         
         1.4.2. RF T70
         A facsimile of a manuscript—the whereabouts of the original being unknown—this item
                     consists of two photographs, which document a vertically folded sheet containing a
                     fair copy of the poem in pen‐and‐ink print lettering in Ruskinʼs hand, along with revisions of the text in his cursive hand, both ink and pencil.
                     The first‐stage fair copy was annotated in pencil by Margaret Ruskin. Possibly, the photographs were taken in the course of preparing the Library Edition; if so, the facsimile was not cited or reproduced in the edition. The photographs
                     are held by The Ruskin at Lancaster University, catalogued as RF T70.
         The folded sheet was photographed spread open and laid flat, with one photograph showing
                     pages 4 and 1 (from left to right), and the other photograph showing the reverse side,
                     pages 2 and 3 (from left to right). The manuscript reveals at least two major stages
                     of composition, a first stage of fair copying, and a second stage of heavy revision.
                     The fair copy occupies pages 1–2 (i.e., both sides of the first leaf), while the remaining
                     pages 3–4 (the second leaf) would originally have been left blank, prior to Ruskinʼs revisions. Subsequently, Ruskin used this blank space, as well as the margins of pages 1–2, for revisions. Thus,
                     the facsimiles preserve a rare instance of a manuscript containing a fair copy of
                     an early work by Ruskin that he subsequently revised using the same sheet.
         
         
         1.4.3. MS III
         A second fair copy appears as the first poem in the MS III Second Poetry Anthology, which is contained in MS III. This Red Book begins with “Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”, a work that likewise reflects an interest in astronomy (see Discussion).
         This fair copy incorporates Ruskinʼs revisions to the first fair copy shown in RF T70. The MS III fair copy was therefore chronologically subsequent to the RF T70 fair copy.
         
         
         
         1.5. Date
         Not earlier than August 1827, nor later than December 1828; most likely the first quarter of 1828, with the possibility of composition initiated in late 1827.
         Neither the MS IA manuscript nor the RF T70 manuscript is dated, and Ruskin assigned no date to the fair copy of the poem in the MS III Second Poetry Anthology as he did to some other poems in that group.
         Cook and Wedderburn ascribed the poem to 1827, and they cited as sources the MS IA and MS III versions (Works, 2:535). No mention is made in the Library Edition of the manuscript captured by the photographs, RF T70. Judging by what little the editors wrote about the poem, they based their dating
                  on an association of “The Constellations” with a poem they declare to have been contemporaneous, “The Monastery”, although they leave the nature of this association unexplained (see Ruskin, Works, 2:260 n. 1). Their method was sound but their conclusion inexact.
         The physical basis for associating the two poems is the similarity of the fragments
                  of rough draft in a pencil, cursive hand—so similar that the two drafts were apparently
                  mistaken as belonging to the same work (see MS IA: Collation of the Original Manuscript and MS IA: Contents, b). For the place of this draft in the chronological sequence of drafting, revising,
                  and fair‐copying “The Constellations”, see Composition and Publication. Here it suffices to explain that Ruskinʼs hand in these draft manuscripts, which is a sprawling cursive in pencil with occasional
                  substitutions in pen‐and‐ink cursive, cannot be earlier than his first use of pen
                  and ink in April 1827; and that the compositional history of “The Monastery” places its MS IA draft fragment, which contains lines of book 2 of the poem, no earlier than August 1827 and possibly starting as late as November 1827, following the familyʼs return to Herne Hill from the Tour of 1827 to Scotland (see Relation to Draft of “The Monastery”; “The Monastery”: Date; and “The Monastery”: Composition and Publication).
         As another physical feature besides the similarity of the MS IA rough drafts linking “The Constellations” chronologically with the composition of “The Monastery”, the first fair copy of “The Constellations” (RF T70) shares orthographic eccentricities of punctuation with the fair copy of books 1–2
                  of “The Monastery” (MS III). For the first twenty lines of “The Constellations”, each line ends with punctuation, occasionally a colon or full‐stop period, but most
                  frequently a prominent comma formed to look like book print, with a dot and a curl.
                  After twenty lines of this observant punctuation, the marks abruptly stop. This pattern
                  is identical to the punctuation in the fair copy of book 1 and the first eighty lines
                  of book 2 of “The Monastery”, in which almost every line of verse ends with a punctuation mark until the punctuation
                  gives out altogether. The pattern suggests that Ruskin may have added the punctuation to these poems all at once, layering the marks over
                  top of the already fair‐copied text, only to grow tired of the exercise and quit.
                  Thereafter, in the fair copies of both poems, only an occasional punctuation mark
                  internal to a verse line appears—a comma or an apostrophe, which is regularly spaced
                  along with the surrounding characters, indicating that the mark was inserted in the
                  course of fair‐copying. Moreover, Ruskinʼs penmanship for the punctuation is similar in the two poemsʼ fair copies, with the
                  marks at the ends of lines of verse tending to float above the baseline (see Relation to Fair Copy of “The Monastery”).
         These practices contrast markedly with the very sparse punctuation in the fragmentary
                  rough drafts of both “The Constellations” and “The Monastery” in MS IA and with the fair‐copied poems comprising the anthology, “poetry discriptive”. The poems in the latter collection exhibit, moreover, an awkward learnerʼs stage
                  of penmanship, including tracing in ink over top of characters formed initially with
                  pencil. These factors put distance between the 1827 “poetry discriptive” and the fair copies of “The Constellations” and “The Monastery”, which in the eccentricity of their punctuation resemble the usage in “Eudosia” (MS IV), which Ruskin dated 28 September 1828 on its title page. While the significance of that date within the compositional history
                  of “Eudosia” is obscure, the triangulation of that projectʼs punctuation practices with those
                  of “The Constellations” and “The Monastery” appears to situate the latter two projects decisively in 1828.
         But when in 1828? If Ruskin based the first lines of “The Constellations” on actual observation of the sky (or perhaps a demonstration at one of the so‐called
                  Lenten astronomy lectures [see Astronomical Education), the alignment of planets and constellations described at the beginning of the poem
                  would have been observable in April–May 1828, and not at all observable in 1827 (see Discussion: “The Constellations” as a Record of Actual Astronomical Observations). This approximate dating would place draft and first fair‐copying of both “The Constellations” and books 1–2 of “The Monastery” in the first quarter of 1828—between the Tour of 1827, which had been delayed until late in the year, and the Tour of 1828, probably begun following John James Ruskinʼs 10 May birthday but interrupted that same month by news of the death of John James Ruskinʼs sister, Jessie.
         Fair‐copying, and possibly initial composition, during the first months of 1828 accord well with the placement of the second fair copy of “The Constellations”, which Ruskin entered in MS III as the first poem in the MS III Second Poetry Anthology, immediately following “Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”. While fair‐copying of that anthology cannot be dated precisely, Ruskin would not have waited long to make a fair copy incorporating the extensive revisions
                  to the first fair copy of “The Constellations” (see Composition and Publication: First Fair Copy [RF T70]); and by juxtaposing that poem as the first in the anthology with the end of the
                  second volume of “Harry and Lucy”, Ruskin emphasized astronomical learning as a shared interest in both the poem and the prose
                  tale. In the tale, Ruskinʼs Harry gives Lucy a drawing of the constellation Charlesʼs Wain “as an introduction to astronomy” (p. 7). Moreover, Ruskin maintained the astronomical theme in the poetry anthology by following “The Constellations” with a fair copy of “The Sun”, which he composed for New Yearʼs, 1 January 1828. That Ruskinʼs orthographic and punctuation practices appear to have progressed little by the
                  time he composed and fair‐copied “Eudosia” several months later—the same kind of catalog poem on a grandiose scale, fair‐copied
                  with the same kind or orthographic eccentricities and even weirder punctuation—can
                  be attributed to a long period of family mourning for the death of his aunt. His father
                  would have been preoccupied at home and in Perth, making arrangements for his sisterʼs estate and orphaned children.
         Remaining open to question is whether composition of the initial draft of “The Constellations” could have begun as early as a date in 1827, as Cook and Wedderburn supposed. A factor that might argue for confining composition to the first quarter of 1828 is the possibility—admittedly questionable—that Ruskin based his opening lines on planetariy observations that were visible in the sky over
                  London only during those months, and not in 1827. Those details, which survive in the opening lines of the poem as fair‐copied, are
                  missing along with the first page(s) of draft from the MS IA manuscript. Thus, a genesis of the MS IA draft commencing, say, in the fourth quarter of 1827 can neither be ruled out nor confirmed.
         
         
         1.6. Composition and Publication
         Poem previously unpublished in entirety, apart from a single line quoted in Ruskin, Works, 2:260 n. 1.
         From surviving documents, a clear chronology is established based on revisions of
                  one document being incorporated in the next. Strikethroughs and substitutions in the
                  MS IA pencil draft are incorporated into the copytext of the fair copy shown in RF T70; and strikethroughs and substitutions in the latter are in turn incorporated into
                  copytext for the MS III fair copy. This genetic history tracks a similar and roughly contemporaneous record
                  of Ruskinʼs development of the poem, “The Monastery”, as witnessed in manuscripts likewise contained in MS IA and MS III. Only “The Constellations”, however, includes a stage of composition in which a fair copy is sacrificed to further
                  revision, at least insofar as surviving evidence can attest.
         As a stage of development in Ruskinʼs compositional methods, “The Constellations” along with “The Monastery” represent a significant advance, which sprang from learning to use pen and ink in
                  April 1827 (see The Ruskin Family Handwriting). For the first time, we see preserved draft containing deletions, substitutions,
                  and insertions, both in pencil and in ink, most of them in Ruskinʼs hand. At least one of the interventions is in the hand of Margaret Ruskin, but this is limited to correcting a mistranscription from the preceding draft. Margaret proofread; she did not herself revise Ruskinʼs text, unless she did so verbally. Evidence suggests that she did censor, however,
                  by marking text she deemed inappropriate in some way. Thus, these states of text open
                  a window onto Ruskinʼs compositional process as an interaction with his audience, his parents—with his
                  mother acting as proofreader and, to a limited extent, as editor. Perhaps these states
                  of draft and fair copy were preserved for this reason, that they recorded a distinct
                  stage of Ruskinʼs learning to write as an interactive process.
         “The Constellations” is also significant for its scope. It is one among several projects of 1828 which are marked by their ambition and length, including the versification of Scottʼs novel, The Monastery, and the “poem on the universe”, Eudosia. Of these three, only “The Constellations” reached a conclusion.
         
         1.6.1. Earliest Surviving Draft, “cepheus and bootes now” (MS IA)
         This pencil‐on‐paper manuscript in a cursive hand, “cepheus and bootes now” (see Manuscripts: MS IA), begins at line 27 of the poem as fair‐copied in RF T70, and from that point the text extends for 49 lines on all four sides of a vertically
                     folded sheet. The surviving text starts at the top of 1r of the manuscript, lacking
                     title or context, evidently in mid‐career of the poem. While nothing definitive can
                     be determined about whether this manuscript is missing a witness to the original beginning
                     of its text—nor can anything be determined about what that opening text would have
                     consisted of—it is likely that the missing draft closely matched the text as fair‐copied
                     in RF T70, given the consistency of the proofreading marks from start to finish on that later
                     manuscript (see First Fair Copy [RF T70]).
         It is possible that an opening piece of the manuscript, now missing, was originally
                     bound in MS IA, but that this piece was lost and its survival or whereabouts untraceable, given
                     the current damaged and unbound state of the collection (see MS IA: Contents, b).
         
         1.6.1.1. Hand
         The hand is recognizably Ruskinʼs cursive, identical to the cursive hand in his holograph May 1827 letter to his father. The latter document—the earliest surviving example of Ruskinʼs use of pen and ink—is composed almost entirely in cursive using a pencil, Ruskin exchanging the pencil for pen and ink only for the closing of the letter, which he
                        also wrote in cursive. In the letter, he continued beyond his signature by appending
                        two poems, still using a pen but switching to print lettering. Similarly here, at
                        the end of “The Constellations” draft, Ruskin switches from pencil to pen and ink for a closing, “I end”, written in cursive. Perhaps
                        he reserved pen and ink for closings in these early cursive manuscripts because the
                        ink suggested to him a sense of finality.
         In this draft version of “The Constellations”, Ruskin also uses pen and ink for a few minor revisions, making substitutions in ink by striking
                        through pencil draft with a pen and writing the substituted word above. This usage,
                        too, may have suggested finality to him, an act of polishing the verse. Alternatively
                        or additionally—and one suspects this also to have been the case in the 1827 letter—Ruskin felt more at ease manually in dipping a pen to form the strokes of print letters
                        as compared with maintaining the flow of cursive. With respect to penmanship, then,
                        the constrained use of pen and ink in “cepheus and bootes now” represents an earlier developmental stage, comparable to the 1827 letter to his father, whereas the first fair copy, RF T70, shows him using a pen not only for extensive print‐lettering but also for longer
                        cursive phrases, albeit sometimes over top of the same phrases in pencil, so far as
                        one can tell from the photograph.
         
         
         1.6.1.2. Two Successive Endings
         Ruskin appears to have ended the poem twice in draft. At the bottom of the inside recto
                        page of the folded sheet (2r), he wrote “end” in pencil, cursive; and on the same
                        line, to the left, he wrote “I end” in ink, also cursive—the ink end being presumably the second of the two, though the order cannot be distinguished
                        from the material evidence. This finis follows Capricornus (the Sea Goat), the last‐listed of the constellations in all three manuscript versions (line 64
                        in the second fair copy, MS III): “and the goat that is formed in the arched sky“. In draft as well as fair copy, this line carries
                        lexical markers of closure—for one, by beginning the line uniquely with and, as if to say, and finally; and for another, by ending the line with a flourish supplied by the quaintly poetic
                        modifier arched (for sources of this poetic diction, see the contextual gloss for arched sky in the witnesses).
         Another ending is found on the back of the folded sheet (2v), where Ruskin added nine lines beyond the ending at the foot of the preceding page (2r). Below
                        these nine addtional lines, on a separate line by itself, he again wrote “I end” in
                        pencil longhand; and to the right of that finis, he wrote “I end” in ink longhand. (Again, presumably the phrase written in ink was
                        subsequent to the pencil phrase, but the evidence is indeterminate.) These nine lines
                        form the peroration of “The Constellations” as fair‐copied in RF T70.
         As originally concluded, therefore, if the “I end” on 2r truly indicates an earlier
                        intention, “cepheus and bootes now” represented a less ambitious work poetically, aiming solely at a catalogue of stars
                        without any summary reflection on its meaning. In this respect, the first version
                        of the poem resembles lists of constellations that could be found in print sources
                        on astronomy aimed specifically at children, such as An Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children (1817) by Mary Martha Sherwood (1775–1851), although even Mrs. Sherwoodʼs lists include implicit commentary in the form of Bible verses (see Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children). Ruskinʼs chief original contribution to such elementary lists consists in his epithets describing
                        some of the constellations he names. The version of the poem ending with Capricornus is an aesthetic, poetic exercise more than a religious or scientific one.
         With the addition of the nine‐line peroration, the poem is complicated by a contest
                        between “history” and “virtue”. The meaning and implications of this contest give
                        Ruskin trouble, as he revises these concluding lines after having fair‐copied them in RF T70 (see Composition and Publication: First Fair Copy (RF T70); and Discussion: Knowledge versus Christian Faith).
         
         
         1.6.1.3. Relation to Draft of “The Monastery”
         As remarked in Date, the physical appearance of this manuscript of draft for “The Constellations” strikingly resembles another item of draft that was probably once bound in MS IA, some surviving draft for “The Monastery”, which begins “now must we leave poor martin there” (lines 29–62 of book 2 of Ruskinʼs versification of Scottʼs novel, as fair‐copied and numbered in MS III). The two poemsʼ drafts resemble one another in the size and kind of paper used for
                        the physical document, and in the sprawling cursive hand used for the pencil draft.
                        A difference between the manuscripts is that “Monastery” draft contains no substitutions, either in pencil or in pen and ink, as does “The Constellations” draft in ink over top of the pencil. (See Manuscripts: MS IA; at the Beinecke Library, the two manuscripts are now (mistakenly) catalogued together as “The Monastery—Manuscript, in an unidentified hand, of passages of verse, undated”, in the subseries,
                        Unbound Manuscripts, of the John Ruskin Collection, Series II: Manuscripts, 1826–1897.)
         Another item of “Monastery” draft, “come on good horse and let us see”, which was definitely bound in MS IA, and which contains lines 14–62 of book 3 of the poem as fair‐copied in MS III, is written in a cursive hand, one portion in pencil and another in ink. The ink
                        cursive hand resembles that used for the revisions of the RF T70 version of “The Constellations”. The physical evidence thus conforms to the probable dating of the “Monastery” draft, which is approximately late 1827 through the first quarter or half of 1828 (with an additional stage of composition and fair‐copying of “The Monastery” possibly extending into 1828–29; see “The Monastery”: Composition and Publication).
         
         
         
         1.6.2. First Fair Copy (RF T70)
         The fair copy preserved in the photograph RF T70 (see Manuscripts: RF T70) incorporates the deletions and substitutions in the draft, “cepheus and bootes now”; and the fair copy comprises the entirety of the surviving draft—including the concluding
                     lines that, as suggested by the material evidence, may have been an afterthought (see
                     Two Successive Endings). Lines 1–26 cannot be verified as exactly following copytext based on the surviving
                     draft, which is evidently missing its original opening. As fair‐copied, however, these
                     lines probably do adhere to the original context, since RF T70 contains markings from the start of the text to the end that can be interpreted as
                     proofreading checkmarks.
         
         1.6.2.1. Hand
         The original fair‐copy text of “The Constellations” shown in the photographs is print‐lettered using pen and ink, thus dating the manuscript
                        as no earlier than April–May 1827, when Ruskin first adopted that medium, and probably later in that year or the next, when he had
                        gained more facility. While the dimensions of the original manuscript shown in RF T70 cannot be measured based on a photograph, the lettering appears to be smaller and
                        more uniform compared to the large, spiky, uneven pen‐and‐ink print lettering that
                        characterizes Ruskinʼs dateable first efforts, such as “Spring: Blank Verse” and “Wales” and some poems in the anthology “poetry discriptive”. In contrast to formation of characters for “Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”, which Ruskin traced using pen and ink over top of pencil lettering, the characters in RF T70 appear free of any underlying pencil guidelines, although the resolution of the photograph
                        may not have sufficed to capture that level of detail (see The Ruskin Family Handwriting).
         
         
         1.6.2.2. Relation to Fair Copy of “The Monastery”
         As remarked in Date, physical similarities connect the first fair copy of “The Constellations” with the fair copy of “The Monastery”, just as resemblances between the two poemsʼ drafts point to an associated process
                        of composition (see Relation to Draft of “The Monastery”). The treatment of text in books 1–2 of “The Monastery” as fair‐copied in MS III has more in common with “The Constellations” as fair‐copied in RF T70 than it does either with the work that immediately precedes the “Monastery” poem in MS III—namely, the anthology “poetry discriptive”, which dates from earlier in 1827—or with the continuing fair copy of books 3–4 of “The Monastery”, which is set apart from books 1–2 in MS III (see “The Monastery”: Composition and Publication—Stage One of Composition). For both “The Monastery”, books 1–2, and the first fair copy of “The Constellations”, RF T70, Ruskin adopted a comparatively miniscule print‐lettering, resembling a serif typeface.
         Moreover, in the “poetry discriptive” poems from earlier in 1827, Ruskin avoided punctuation almost entirely, whereas punctuation does characterize the fair
                        copies of “The Constellations” and “The Monastery”, books 1–2. In both, moreover. the punctuation marks share eccentricities suggesting
                        a learner who has an uncertain grasp of the grammatical and rhetorical function of
                        punctuation but who is excited—at least initially—by the physical appearance of the
                        marks on the page. Almost every line of books 1–2 of “The Monastery” is punctuated, regardless of grammatical or rhetorical need, and the marks are used
                        exclusively at the ends of lines. This obsessive but misinformed observance abruptly
                        ceases at book 2, line 80, of “The Monastery”, at the top of page 79 of the MS III fair copy. Just so, the end of every line of the RF T70 “Constellations” fair copy is notched with a punctuation mark until line 20, where the practice abruptly
                        stops.
         Where used, the punctuation in the opening lines of both fair‐copied poems often seems
                        arbitrary. While the full‐stop periods make grammatical sense in most instances, the
                        commas, colons, and (most prominently in “The Monastery”) an upside‐down semicolon seem interchangeable with one another in their rhetorical
                        use and placement. Both these fair copies give the impression that Ruskin layered over the texts with bookish punctuation to convey the appearance of print,
                        without understanding the grammatical and rhetorical function of the marks. Finally,
                        in both fair copies, the punctuation markup stops abruptly at an arbitrary place,
                        suggesting that Ruskin grew tired of the exercise, ran out of time, or was informed about his erroneous
                        usage.
         The oddities of punctuation, then, in both manuscripts should be classed with other
                        attempts to give the fair copy an appearance of print. The first letters of each line
                        are capitalized, and the first word of line 1 is rendered in all capitals. As another
                        bookish touch, lines are numbered by fives in the left margin.
         Despite these preoccupations with penmanship and presentation, “The Constellations” and books 1–2 of “The Monastery” are ambitious and interesting projects, a leap beyond the lyric‐descriptive poems
                        fair‐copied in pen‐and‐ink a half‐year earlier—“Spring: Blank Verse”, “Wales”, and the poems comprising “poetry discriptive”. A half‐year later than “The Constellations”, the catalogue poem, “Eudosia” nominally maintains the ambition—a “poem on the universe”—yet seems to attempt less.
                        Perhaps the disturbing events that intervened—the Ruskinsʼ aborted Tour of 1828, which was cut short by the death of Jessie Richardson, the period of mourning, and the resettlement of Jessieʼs orphaned children, including the adoption of Mary Richardson into the Herne Hill household—caused a hiatus in Ruskinʼs learning.
         
         
         1.6.2.3. Margaret Ruskinʼs Role in the Fair‐Copying Process
         An especially valuable feature of the RF T70 fair copy is the evidence of Margaret Ruskinʼs participation in the compositional process. At line 54 of the poem, Margaretʼs handwriting can be unmistakably identified. The intervention is a penciled correction
                        of a mistranscription of a word from the draft text, substituting the word “bear”
                        for Ruskinʼs erroneously copied “appear”. The insertion is accompanied by a penciled deletion
                        of “appear” using a style of strikethrough that differs from all other instances of
                        strikethrough, save one at line 30 (see the textual gloss hanging from line 54, “The horn the unicorn doth appear”). From this evidence, one may infer that a series of other pencil marks on the manuscript—a
                        diagonal or double diagonal line at the end of each line of verse—records Margaretʼs proofreading of the fair copy against the draft manuscript. That these diagonal
                        marks were Margaretʼs is substantiated by their replacement by × marks next to certain lines of verse, which evidently signaled her concerns, prompting
                        revisions by John. It is possible that the proofreading marks were made by somebody other than Margaret—John James Ruskin, for example—but his handwriting does not otherwise appear in the manuscript.
         While we can only infer Margaretʼs objections based on the content of the original verse and on Ruskinʼs substitution, the topics that drew her censorship seem evident enough. An × by the constellation Medusaʼs Head suggests that the image was deemed too horrible. Ruskin substituted in the margin a line about the constellation, Herschelʼs Telescope, replacing the ancient wonder of Medusaʼs stare, with which the pagan hero Perseus wreaked violence and retribution, with the modern wonder of the seven‐foot optical
                        instrument, with which the British scientific hero, William Herschel (1738–1822), discovered the planet Uranus. Even the feline violence of the “furious lynx” was tagged to be tamed, replaced by Ruskin with its “keen‐eyed” attribute.
         A different kind of horror apparently was suggested by the constellation Altar, which would have evoked dangerously pagan practices. This line having prompted double
                        ×s for revision, Ruskin substituted the Scriptural epithet, “gods fire”, implying that the “strange fire”
                        of paganism would be snuffed out (Lev. 10). One other change was demanded to prevent a jest from disturbing the gravity
                        of the subject; and some lines were marked with an × for no obvious reason other than to improve the verse: the trite and redundant epithet
                        “pretty” was rejected, and an imperfect rhyme needed mending (see textual and contextual
                        glosses hanging from line 14, “Then the dread medusas head”; line 30, “After that the furious lynx”; line 44, “Next to it the altar”; lines 17 and 64, “After that doth come the lyre” and “I wish I had not observed the lyre”; lines 12 and 40, “Then the very pretty swan” and “Next the very pretty crane”; lines 41 and 42, “Antinoüs and arrow soon” and “After it the southern crown”).
         Each of the lines marked with an × prompted a revision in Ruskinʼs hand. In most cases, he drafted the revision in the margin adjacent to the line,
                        first writing in cursive with a pencil, and then in some cases writing in cursive
                        with pen and ink to revise the revision over top of the pencil. Insofar as the available
                        evidence shows, then, the revisions were invented by Ruskin; no other hand is present in the draft revision, although of course we cannot know
                        what discussion, if any, surrounded his decisions. We also cannot know for certain
                        at what point in the fair‐copying the process of proofreading and marking for revision
                        began. Since the poem is fair‐copied through to the end of the extant MS IA draft, it is reasonable to conclude that Ruskin completed the fair‐copying before it was subjected to scrutiny, although some finishing
                        touches are incomplete: the marginal line numbering halts after line 60, with fifteen
                        remaining lines left unnumbered; and as already remarked, most punctuation, particularly
                        at the ends of verse lines, is abandoned after about line 20. Perhaps at this final
                        stage of touch‐up, Margaret (or perhaps Margaret as well as John James) intervened with a review. Ruskin may even have been surprised by the demand for revision. The manuscript is unique
                        among the juvenilia as a fair copy that was subjected to a critique, resulting in
                        revisions made on the fair copy itself.
         It may be no coincidence that Ruskinʼs marginal line‐numbering was arrested at line 60, since at lines 57–60 the most
                        extensive single passage is flagged for revision, with a long diagonal line and ×s marking a quatrain about the constellation Libra (the Scales), ending in a mention of the Milky Way. The passage may have been flagged merely because the original lines, both in draft
                        and fair copy, are somewhat incoherent: the lines develop a paradox of the Scales being capable of weighing “nothing” yet containing a “thousand more”—more even than
                        “the beautiful milky way”—but with the implied object, stars, being absent from the lines. The omission may or may not have been deliberate, but
                        instead of revising to clarify the paradoxical conceit, Ruskin substituted a couplet that veers to a different topic altogether—the Scales as a symbol of justice, which was a traditional treatment of this constellation,
                        particularly in Roman astronomy (see the contextual gloss hanging from line 57, “The scales that nothing to weigh would bear”).
         Ruskin began the revision of the Libra quatrain in pencil at the bottom of the inner fold of the pamphlet, sprawling across
                        the fold to the opposite recto (pp. 3–4, which would have been blank at that point),
                        and coninuing onto the back of the pamphlet (p. 4). Nine lines of cursive pencil text
                        wrestle with the topic of justice (see the textual gloss hanging from lines 57–60,
                        “that nothing to weigh would bear / . . . / More than than the beautiful milky way”); and then, at the bottom and top‐right of the inner fold (pp. 3–4), he overwrote
                        this pencil draft with pen and ink, still in cursive, recasting the lines on Libra as the couplet they became in the MS III fair copy. Next, on remaining space in the middle of the inner recto (p. 3), and
                        over top of pencil draft on the back (p. 4), Ruskin drafted in pen and ink new lines on the Milky Way as they appear in the MS III fair copy (lines 65–69). In these new lines, Ruskin expanded on the Milky Way, previously mentioned only as a comparison with what stars could be weighed in Libraʼs scales. Now he elaborated on the myth of the Milky Way as a roadway to heaven for the heroes of mythology. In connection with this image,
                        his revisions reveal that Ruskin wrestled, not just with squeamish objections to violent or pagan imagery, but with
                        broader concepts such as the relation between “history” (revised to “knowledge”) and
                        “virtue” (see Discussion—Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology).
         
         
         
         1.6.3. Second Fair Copy (MS III)
         At some point after New Yearʼs 1828, Ruskin fair‐copied “The Constellations” into the Red Book, MS III, incorporating the revisions to the poem drafted in the margins of the RF T70 fair copy. Placed following “Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”, “The Constellations” is now presented as the first poem in an anthology, “POETRY”, the MS III Second Poetry Anthology, where it precedes copies of two bygone New Yearʼs poems, “Time: Blank Verse”, the New Yearʼs ode for January 1827, and “The Sun”, the New Yearʼs ode for January 1828.
         Between the end of “The Sun” and the next poem in the anthology, “Glenfarg”, Ruskin prominently printed the date “January 1 1828”, floating between two parallel decorative rules. This label does not necessarily
                     signify that this poetry anthology (along with the preceding “Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”) constituted a New Yearʼs gift for January 1828. That purpose presumably was served by a separate presentation copy of “The Sun” and “Glenfarg”, preserved in MS XI, in which the two poems are fair‐copied in the same order as presented here, in MS III. It is unknown how much time lapsed between the January 1828 New Yearʼs presentation of “The Sun” and “Glenfarg” and their placement following “The Constellations” as contributions to a new anthology. It seems likely that Ruskin would not have waited long to fair‐copy “The Constellations” following his revision of the RF T70 fair copy, and that he finalized the poem in this MS III version—assuming that no other fair copy intervened—as part of the anthology sometime
                     prior to the familyʼs departure in May for the Tour of 1828.
         Presented together with “Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2” on one side and “Time: Blank Verse” and “The Sun” on the other, “The Constellations” anchors these works in a cosmos. The second volume of “Harry and Lucy” continues the familyʼs travels across Britain that started with the tour to Hastings described in “Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I”, while the New Yearʼs poems commemorate the cycles of time over days and months,
                     culminating in the sunset and emergence of the circumpolar constellations at the end
                     of “The Sun”. Amidst it all walks Ruskin “with dear mamma beside me” admiring the garden flowers, which he will catalog in
                     his “poem on the universe”, “Eudosia”.
         
         
         
         1.7. Discussion
         “The Constellations”, like other poems and prose by Ruskin of 1826–28 that mention the fixed stars and other astronomical phenomena, was composed in context
                  of popular education in astronomy for adults and children in the early nineteenth century in Britain. This movement is surveyed in Astronomical Education, and parts of the following discussion are keyed to the context of that broader note.
         Ruskinʼs purpose in “The Constellations” is more poetic than scientific. As his most original contribution to the versified
                  catalogue of constellations that constitutes the poem, he assigns descriptive epithets
                  to several of the constellation names. While the poem is not entirely lacking in the
                  influence of childrenʼs scientific lessons in astronomy, which were typical the period,
                  Ruskin admitted in a note added belatedly in the compositional process—the note first appears
                  in the Second Fair Copy—that his arrangement of constellation names is unsystematic with respect to the starsʼ
                  actual positions in the sky. The note is less disingenuous than it seems and may play
                  down a significant achievement in spatial imagination (see “The Constellations” as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception); nonetheless, the poem represents an early and playful stage in Ruskinʼs ongoing astromical education (see “The Constellations” as Marking a Stage of Astronomical Education).
         As a stage of learning, the poem is somewhat elusive in allowing one to gauge the
                  extent of Ruskinʼs knowledge about the constellations and their myths. He derived some of his epithets,
                  not from mythology, but from fables—particularly stories that could apply to constellations
                  representing beasts and birds (see Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology). Given his motherʼs censorship described in Margaret Ruskinʼs Role in the Fair‐Copying Process, Ruskin may have avoided expressing some of what he knew about myth. Regrettably, to understand
                  his exposure, the identity of a “lesson book” on astronomy mentioned in “Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III” remains conjectural, but on the evidence of “The Constellations” he must have had access to an up‐to‐date source like a recent star atlas, which likely
                  would have relayed legendary as well as scientific information (see Astronomical Education: Print Sources of Astronomical Education—Star Atlases; and Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology). There has also survived a celestial globe belonging to the family, which is dated
                  ca. 1820, the decade when Ruskin composed "The Constellations", and which was manufactured
                  by Smith & Son (17 cm x 88.9 mm, object GA2197, Southwark Heritage Centre and Walworth Library,
                  London).
         In the three diplomatically edited texts of “The Constellations”, contextual glosses attached to each of the constellation names summarize the information
                  commonly available in popular works on astronomy published in the 1820s. The information includes the position in the sky and the periods of the year when
                  each constellation was visible, if at all, in the night sky above London; the legends, if any, associated with each constellation, especially the more commonly
                  known Greek and Roman myths connected with ancient constellations; and the origin
                  of comparatively more recent constellations and their significance for British amateur
                  astronomers in the early nineteenth century (e.g., at this time, the heavens were mapped with a large number of constellations
                  invented between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, which became obsolete in the later nineteenth and twentieth centuries; also, some constellations were typically treated as pairs, which Ruskin for some reason separated and named singly in his poem). Given the uncertainty about
                  Ruskinʼs sources of information, the glosses survey what he may have known, not what he necessarily did know or was allowed or encouraged to
                  learn.
         For an overview of the kinds of print sources available to amateur astronomers in
                  the 1820s, see see Astronomical Education: Print Sources of Astronomical Education. The sources regularly cited in the constextual glosses include A Celestial Atlas (1822) by Alexander Jamieson, the most influential British star atlas of the period; and two popular sources that
                  borrowed heavily from Jamiesonʼs Celestial Atlas, but that also reveal contexts of debate about astronomical lore in the period: A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy by Jehoshaphat Aspin, which was written to accompany Uraniaʼs Mirror; or A View of the Heavens, a set of cards illustrated with the mythical figures outlining the constellations
                  and punctuated with holes in the place of the starsʼ positions, which glowed when
                  held up to a light (ca. 1824–25); and Astronomical Recreations, (1824) by Jacob Green (1790–1841), an American chemist who produced the book while between professorships at Princeton University and at Jefferson Medical College (Smith, “Jacob Green”, 421). More up‐to‐date historical sources referenced in the glosses include Star Tales (2018) by Ian Ridpath, along with Ridpathʼs helpful online resources, and Lost Constellations by John Barentine, which focuses on the stories of obsolete constellations.
         
         1.7.1. “The Constellations” as Marking a Stage of Astronomical Education
         See Astronomical Education for the range of print texts that was available to Ruskin as sources of basic instruction in astronomy. Chronologically, the composition of
                     “The Constellations” was positioned following a period in 1826–27 when he had begun to read John Aikin and Letitia Barbauldʼs Evenings at Home, which contains dialogues covering some basic topics in astronomy, such as the forces
                     that drive the rotations of the solar system (see Astronomical Education: Scientific and Practical Astronomical Dialogues; and Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Physical Descriptions—Evenings at Home).
         Following this introductory reading, Ruskinʼs period of composition, revision, and fair‐copying of “The Constellations” in 1827–28 would have accompanied or shortly followed his reading of additional educational
                     dialogues on astronomy, which pick up where the conversations in Evenings at Home leave off—namely, the astronomy of the constellations both as a discipline of practical
                     and scientific reasoning and as an appreciation of beauty. This stage of reading consisted
                     at least of volume 2, “Of Astronomy”, of Jeremiah Joyceʼs Scientific Dialogues; and of passages in Thomas Dayʼs The History of Sandford and Merton, in which the Tutor, Mr. Barlow, draws on Harry Sandfordʼs practical experience in reading the night sky to spark Tommy Mertonʼs admiration for the beauty and wonder of the fixed stars (see Astronomical Education: Scientific and Practical Astronomical Dialogues). Ruskin himself identifies his use of these latter sources for astronomical education in
                     “Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”, whereas his reading of the rudimentary dialogues Evenings at Home is presumptive, based on evidence of his familiarity with this work in “Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I”.
         It is possible that this first stage of astronomical education, preceding and contemporaneous
                     with the composition of “The Constellations”, also relied on one of the primers in astronomical science written for children in
                     the first third of the century (see Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children). This kind of text was more likely to emphasize memorization rather than dialogic
                     exchange; and primers of the 1820s for young readers perhaps more emphatically staked the purpose of astronomical study
                     in religious admiration rather than practical and scientific reasoning. In its form,
                     Ruskinʼs poem embodies the memorization exercises typical of these primers, while its rhetoric
                     reflects no particular agenda of piety—at least not initially so. Arguably, that agenda
                     is layered over the initial version, at the urging of Margaret Ruskinʼs flags for revision (see Margaret Ruskinʼs Role in the Fair‐Copying Process and The Genre of “The Constellations”).
         By 1828–29, one year beyond the composition, revision, and fair‐copying of “The Constellations”, Ruskin recorded statistical astronomical information in his “Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III”, which was typically found in sophisticated print sources known as star atlases, although such information was also plagiarized from star atlases in the more advanced
                     astronomical primers for young readers, such as Aspinʼs A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy. The identity of this type of source or sources used by Ruskin remains elusive (see Astromical Education: Star Atlases). Whatever the source, while Ruskinʼs presentation of astronomical information in “Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III” appears more informed and sophisticated than the simple naming in “The Constellations”, “Harryʼs” approach seems flat and pedantic compared to the energy and invention of the earlier
                     poem.
         
         
         1.7.2. “The Constellations” as a Record of Actual Astronomical Observations
         As indicated by Ruskinʼs sources, “The Constellations” is a bookish poem. Even in Ruskinʼs books, however, Dayʼs and Joyceʼs tutors begin study of astronomy by directing their pupilsʼ attention to the evening
                     sky. To what extent, if any, might Ruskinʼs composition of his poem have involved actual astronomical observation?
         Ruskin opens his poem by hailing Venus and Mars. In the instructional dialogues, planets—the wandering stars—are not an obvious starting point for astronomy lessons in the open air (see Astronomical Education: Instructional Dialogues on Astronomy). Fictional tutors typically begin by asking pupils to find the most commonly recognizable
                     constellation or fixed stars, Charlesʼs Wain. As suggested by an earlier poem, “Glen of Glenfarg” (“Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill”), Ruskin had long been able to orient himself to that formation in the night sky. Nonetheless,
                     equally striking objects for young stargazers are Venus, the Morning Star and Evening Star, and Mars, the red planet. Ruskin may have chosen those planets to begin his poem because they are famously beautiful
                     and striking celestial bodies with familiar mythological associations. In his books,
                     Venus was singled out for the planetʼs beauty (see “The Constellations” as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception). It is also possible that the particular alignment described in the poem—Venus and Mars visible on the ecliptic, with the constellation Orion setting on the horizon—indicates an actual and datable observation.
         In the poem, Ruskin positions Venus specifically as the Evening Star near the constellation Orion. According to a digital‐age star chart, the Sky & Telescope Interactive Sky Chart, Venus would have been visible from London as the Evening Star, setting in the west along with Orion during April–June 1828. (During that period, another bright object that was visible low in the evening sky,
                     which an observer might have confused with a planet, was Sirius or the “Dog Star”, in the constellation Canis Major. It is positioned directly below Orion.) During those same months, Mars would have risen from the east, traveling “high . . . [in] the sky”, as Ruskinʼs poem says, a few hours after Venus had set (Sky & Telescope, Interactive Star Chart and Celestial Almanac, accessed 12 April 2023).
         This calculation accords with tables of constellations in the “Calendarium Stellaris”, subtitled an “Easy Method of Finding the Stars for Every Month of the Year”, in
                     the 1825 edition of Aspinʼs Familiar Treatise on Astronomy. Describing the sky viewed from London each month “in about the middle of . . . the month, at half‐past nine oʼclock in
                     the evening”, the Calendarium lists Orion as appearing “nearly on the meridian” in January and moving toward the “space between
                     “W. by S. and S.W. by W.” by March. The constellation is omitted from the listings
                     for April, presumably because it would have set by 9:00 P.M. (Aspin, A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy, 161, 167, 168–69). The digital star chart shows that Orion set in the late‐afternoon dusk of April 1828, preceded by Venus; and as the weeks advanced, Venus set later in the evening than Orion, which had vanished by sunset. A comparison of findings using the Sky & Telescope Interactive Sky Chart with the Calendarium identifies April 1828, therefore, as the period when the tracks of Venus and Mars overlapped with a sighting of Orion. According to the digital star chart, this configuration was never visible at dusk
                     or nighttime in 1827.
         Tending to confirm these observations in the first quarter of the year, Ruskin includes the southern constellation, Crater, in the poem, which is visible from the latitude of London in the evening sky, annually from December through May. The poem also names southern
                     constellations that cannot be viewed from the latitude of London at all, but Ruskinʼs choice of these appears related to a sentiment for their legends. The choice of
                     Crater seems arbitrary other than its regular rising and setting in the southern sky, culminating
                     in April (see Crater, contextual gloss).
         It is possible, then, that actual observations of the evening sky lay behind the composition
                     of the poemʼs introductory lines, a possibility that aligns with the evidence in Composition and Publication supporting the year 1828 as a probable period of composition or at least revision of the poem. (Since the
                     partially surviving manuscript of the MS IA draft lacks the opening lines, the possibility of an earlier date in 1827 for the inception of the poem remains open.) April–May was typically the period when
                     Ruskin prepared poems for his fatherʼs birthday in May, thus suggesting an occasion as well
                     as a terminus a quo for the start of either composition or revision of “The Constellations”.
         Whether or not Ruskin looked up from his books to the sky for an inspiration to open his poem, he was also
                     prompted to admiration of Orion by Dayʼs fictional character, Tommy Merton, who, “looking up to the sky . . . observed so remarkable a constellation, that he
                     . . . begged to know the name”. On learning it was called Orion, he “was so delighted with the grandeur and beauty of this glorious constellation,
                     that he could not help observing it, by intervals, all the evening; and he was surprised
                     to see that it seemed to pass on, in a right line drawn from east to west; and that
                     all the stars he had become acquainted with moved every night in the same direction”.
                     In the opening four lines of the poem, Ruskin echoes the alliterative modifiers with which Mr. Barlow describes the experience of gazing at the constellations: “‘I should think there
                     would be a very great pleasure in observing such a number of glorious, glittering bodies as are now above us’” (Day, The History of Sandford and Merton, 187–88, 165 [emphasis added]; see also “The Constellations” as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception).
         Following Orion, Ruskin goes on to name circumpolar constellations—all “northern” constellations, as announced
                     in the first part of the poemʼs subtitle (lines 7–14; see Title). As possible real sightings, it is striking that he begins with Ursa Major (the Great Bear), which likewise tops the list for April in the “Calendarium Stellaris”, that constellation being positioned “in the zenith”. Moreover, the “lower star in
                     the tail” of the bear “at about 65 degrees high” is “one of those called Charlesʼs Wain”—the next to be identified by Ruskin, albeit not surprisingly. All six of the following constellations named in the poem
                     were also visible in April, according to the Calendarium: Draco (the Dragon), Coma Berenices (Bereniceʼs Hair), Corona Borealis (the Northern Crown), Cygnus (the Swan). Cor Caroli (Charlesʼs Heart), and Medusaʼs Head (Aspin, A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy, 168–69). Only with Telescopium Herschelii (Herschelʼs Telescope) does Ruskin depart from naming what he could actually have viewed overhead in April 1828, and that choice was a substitution evidently to placate alarm over Medusaʼs Head (see Margaret Ruskinʼs Role in the Fair‐Copying Process).
         Hereafter in Ruskinʼs poem, the sequence of constellations appears more erratic, with the repeated “next
                     comes” ceasing necessarily to refer to star formations that are adjacent in the dome
                     of the sky. In the second fair copy, in MS III, Ruskin forestalled objections by adding a note with a caveat: “These constellations though
                     they are next in this poetry are not next in the sky”. The note is not attached by
                     an asterisk to a particular line in the poem, seeming to refer to the whole, so it
                     is unclear whether he would have exempted the first fourteen lines from observable
                     phenomena.
         
         
         1.7.3. The Genre of “The Constellations”
         The genre of “The Constellations”, at its most basic level, is a catalogue poem, simply naming the constellations.
                     As a list, the poem shares some characteristics with an astronomical primer, An Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children (1817) by Mrs. Sherwood (1775–1851). While no record of this book or a work like it is recorded in the Ruskin family
                     library, Mrs. Sherwood introduces the topic of the constellations with a heading identical to Ruskinʼs main title, “The Constellations”, and follows that heading with subdivisions, each with its own heading, that sorts
                     the constellations into “Constellations in the Zodiac or Ecliptic”, “Constellations
                     to the North of the Ecliptic”, and “Constellations to the South of the Ecliptic”—subdivisions
                     that resemble Ruskinʼs subtitle to his poem, “Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and Some of the Southern”.
         As a catalogue poem, “The Constellations” perhaps reflects Mrs. Sherwoodʼs pedagogical assumption that a childʼs act of naming and identifying heavenly bodies
                     precedes understanding of the physical laws that govern their motion, and the development
                     of a spatial imagination required to grasp the relation of the earthʼs revolutions
                     to the apparent motion of the constellations across the sky. In each of her hemispheric
                     categories, Mrs. Sherwood merely lists the names of constellations—the Latin name followed by its English translation—which
                     matches Ruskinʼs procedure in his catalogue poem, except for his added embellishment of a poetic
                     epithet to describe some of the constellations. Mrs. Sherwood provides no information about each of the constellations; rather, she annotates the
                     respective lists with a Bible verse that mentions the stars and praises the Creator.
         As a reflection of a stage of astronomical education, “The Constellations” obviously represents an elementary exercise in naming and memorization. Unlike Mrs. Sherwoodʼs lists of names, however, Ruskinʼs catalogue is not encased within Scripture quotations that monitor the aim of memorization
                     with expressions of piety. Rather, the compositional history suggests that moral and
                     Christian (but not specifically Scriptural) admonition was layered onto the poem to
                     contain the paganism presented by its list of names. See Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology.
         
         
         1.7.4. “The Constellations” as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception
         “These constellations though they are next in this poetry are not next in the sky”.
                     This note, which Ruskin added to the second fair copy, can be read as an admission of failure to recognize
                     the astronomerʼs mapping of the visible galaxy. Turn the sentence around—“These constellations,
                     though not next in the sky, are next in this poetry”—and the statement stakes a claim
                     for poetic form.
         As an aesthetic project, “The Constellations” derives from an exercise in spatial perception and translating that perception into
                     a graphic representation. In The History of Sandford and Merton, Tommy Merton proposes to Mr. Barlow to memorize the positions of the stars forming the constellations by “‘mak[ing] a
                     mark upon . . . paper for every star in Charlesʼ Wain; and I would place the marks just as I see the stars placed in the sky; and I would
                     entreat you to write the names for me, and this I would do till I was acquainted with
                     all the stars in the heavens’”. Mr. Barlow applauds the project but points out that paper is flat, whereas the sky, as Tommy says, “‘seems to rise from the earth on every side like the dome of a great church’”.
                     “‘Then if you were to have some round body’”, Mr. Barlow suggests, “‘I should think it would correspond to the different parts of the sky,
                     and you might place your stars with more exactness’”. The tutor accordingly supplies
                     Tommy with a paper‐covered ball, enabling him to devise his own celestial globe based on
                     his own observations of the constellations, remarking both the constellationsʼ relative
                     positions and their nightly movements in the sky. Starting by drawing his “favourite
                     constellation of Charlesʼs Wain”, Tommy next marks the constellation situated on the opposite side of the Pole‐star, which
                     Mr. Barlow identifies as Cassiopeia; and then he is captured by the “grandeur and beauty” of the “glorious constellation”
                     Orion, which “he could not help observing . . . by intervals, all the evening” as “it seemed
                     to pass on, in a right line drawn from east to west” (Day, The History of Sandford and Merton, 164–65, 187–88). Is Ruskinʼs poem, “The Constellations”, his version of putting the constellations on paper, albeit on flat paper?
         Ruskin begins his poem with Tommyʼs admiration of the “grandeur and beauty” of Orion rather than with the practical lesson initiated by Dayʼs and Joyceʼs tutors, who advise first finding Charlesʼs Wain, then tracing its pointer stars to the Pole Star, thereby enabling one to locate the other northern circumpolar constellations in
                     relation to the Wain (i.e., Ursa Major, the Great Bear). As Dayʼs Mr. Barlow explains, “by remembering these stars” that form Charlesʼs Wain, one can “very easily observe those which are next to them, and learn their names
                     too, till you are acquainted with the whole face of the heavens” (Day, History of Sandford and Merton, 163; see also Joyce, Scientific Dialogues, 2:16–19). This is the practical recommendation by Harry Sandford, the farmerʼs boy, for how to find oneʼs way when lost on a dark night. Ruskin, in lines 7–11, does name a cluster of circumpolar constellations, starting with
                     Ursa Major and Charlesʼs Wain. First, however, he predicates his sequence on beauty rather than pragmatism, by
                     beginning the poem with “stars” traditionally regarded as the most beautiful—Venus, the so‐called Morning Star and Evening Star, “Glittering in the evening air”, a
                     wandering rather than a fixed star; and “beside it”, Orionʼs Belt, “a glorious sight for all sky loving men”. Even for Joyceʼs drier Tutor, Venus is “by far the most beautiful of . . . all” planets, prompting a quotation from Milton praising the Evening and Morning Star; and for Tommy Merton, “Orion, which rose every night and glittered in the south”, entices his continuing star‐gazing,
                     perhaps also supplying Ruskin with his rhapsodic modifier (Scientific Dialogues, 2:198; Day, History of Sandford and Merton, 199). From this glittering horizon, Ruskinʼs poem leads the eye aloft along the ecliptic to Mars, “high / On his throne” and thence to the circumpolar “greater bear” with “charlesʼs wain”.
         Beyond initially declaring the constellations “a glorious sight” as opposed to a utilitarian
                     compass, does the poem go on to form a coherent graphic translation of the sky? If,
                     as Ruskinʼs belated note in MS III admits, the poemʼs sequence of constellation names are “not next in the sky”—that
                     is, if the poem does not in a systematic manner, as Mr. Barlow “‘entreat[s]’”, perform the functionally pedagogical purpose of “‘plac[ing] the marks
                     just as I see the stars placed in the sky; and . . . writ[ing] the names for me, .
                     . . till I was acquainted with all the stars in the heavens’”—then what pattern, if
                     any, is formed by situating the constellations “next in this poetry”? Does the ordering
                     of the constellations in the poem reveal an aesthetic, if not a practical aim?
         While the poemʼs repeated “next” seems to line up the constellation names without
                     a plan, the sequence of naming can be interpreted as the equivalent of Mr. Barlowʼs paper globe—that is, the constellation names inscribe a formal pattern on a star
                     map that reads as a spherical shape plotted on a flat plane. As mentioned at the start
                     of this Discussion, Ruskin did own a celestial globe. Print sources were also available to him that contained
                     examples of planispheres, such as Jamiesonʼs “Stereographic Projection of the Northern Celestial Hemisphere on the Plane of the
                        Equinoctial” (Celestial Atlas, pl. 1). Ruskinʼs poem can be read as reversing Mr. Barlowʼs suggestion, by flattening a celestial globe or dome of the sky on paper in the
                     manner of a “stereographic projection”. The eye of Ruskinʼs speaker inscribes a series of arcs, first by anchoring a “glorious sight”: “there”
                     is Venus “in the evening air”, with Orion “beside it”. Then, having anchored Venus and Orion on a horizontal plane, the speaker raises the eye “high” to Mars, thus forming an arc. Ruskin anchors an on the horizon and inscribes a spatial arc upward in the sky. As the poem
                     goes on to name the constellations, a spatial pattern emerges of repeated anchoring
                     and arcing, tracing a verbal planisphere.
         The sequence begins with the northern circumpolar constellations (lines 7–11), as
                     do the printed scientific dialogues. In Ruskinʼs sources, the dialogues typically identify only a few of these constellations—Charlesʼs Wain inside of Ursa Major, its pointer stars leading the eye to the Pole Star, which forms the tip of Ursa Minorʼs tail. In Ruskinʼs poem, the circumpolar constellations serve repeatedly as an anchor to which the
                     sequence returns at fairly regular intervals: Cor Caroli (Charlesʼs Heart, line 13), Ursa Minor (Little Bear, line 18), Cepheus and Bootes (line 27), Lynx (line 30), and Cameleopardalis (line 33). In between these returns to the center, the poem arcs outward by naming
                     constellations on the periphery of the planisphere. This oscillating pattern begins
                     by naming Cygnus (the Swan, line 12), which, viewed from London, skirts the north‐northeast horizon (i.e., at 9:00 P.M. in the evening, to adopt
                     Aspinʼs standard, and choosing the first quarter of 1828 for observation). From Cygnus, the poemʼs next‐named constellation (Cor Caroli) returns the viewer to the center, only to be directed back to the periphery with
                     Caput Medusae (Medusaʼs Head, line 14, as originally drafted and fair‐copied), which lies on the
                     north‐northwest horizon. This time, before returning to the center, the next named
                     constellation circles the viewer back to the northeast horizon near Cygnus, by calling out Equuleus (Little Horse), Anser (Goose), and Lyra (Lyre) (lines 15–17). Then back to the center (Ursa Minor), only to rebound to the Cygnus group in the northeast by naming Vulpecula (the Fox, line 19; see plates 14–15 of Uraniaʼs Mirror, which picture all these constellations). The pattern is comparable to placing oneʼs
                     thumb on the polar north of a celestial globe, or on the center‐point of a planisphere
                     map of the northern hemisphere, and extending oneʼs fingers first toward the quadrant
                     containing Cygnus, and then rotating toward the quadrant containing Perseus et Caput Medusae, and then back again.
         Having established this sideways rotation, at line 20 the poem plunges into the southern
                     hemisphere, casting a meridian arc from North Pole to South Pole. Thus, a circle becomes
                     a sphere. Naming the “blessed cross”, Ruskin forms a latitudinal vector that can point simultaneously north and south, since the
                     name cross can refer either to Cygnus, which is also known as the Northern Cross, or to Crux, the Southern Cross. To confirm the southern direction, Ruskin next names Robur Carolinum (Charlesʼs Oak, line 21), which is nearly adjacent to Crux. Then, sending a latitudinal line back up the sphere, the sequence passes through
                     Crater (the Cup, line 22)—a southern constellation that, unlike Crux and Robur Carolinum, lies far enough north to be visible from London on the southwest horizon. Continuing north, the poem lands on Hercules and Cerberus (lines 23–24), near the northern pole. Having inscribed this latitudinal circle,
                     the poem returns to the longitudinal circle by again naming constellations in the
                     Cygnus group—Lacerta (the Lizard, line 25), and Aquila (the Eagle, line 26). Finally, the poem regains the northern pole by naming Cepheus, the King, and Bootes, the Huntsman, (line 27), constellations that are balanced on nearly opposite sides
                     of the pole. And then the poem loops to the South Pole again, naming Apus (Bird of Paradise, line 28, Anglicized as the English “Hirundo” or Swallow, in Ruskinʼs translation).
         In “Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”, Ruskinʼs Harry presents Lucy with a flat diagram of Charlesʼs Wain as an “introduction to astronomy”. Ruskin reproduces the diagram as a “plate” in his tale, copied from Joyceʼs Scientific Dialogues, where the Tutor similarly presents his pupils, Charles and James, with the diagram. (Joyce, Scientific Dialogues, 2:16; fig. 1)
         
         
         1.7.5. “The Constellations” as an Expression of British Pride
         Ruskin makes a point of naming constellations with British associations, including Telescopium Herschelii (Herschelʼs Telescope) and the Carolingian constellations, Cor Caroli (Charlesʼs Heart) and Rober Carolinum (Charlesʼs Oak)—the latter requiring a plunge into southern constellations invisible to British viewers.
                     Ruskin also lends an English inflection to constellation names where possible: for example,
                     Apus is not the tropical Bird of Paradise but the northern Swallow; Leo is not the fierce Nemean Lion but the “generous” and therefore, one supposes, British kingly beast (see the contextual
                     glosses for these constellations; see also Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children).
         British pride in the nationʼs standing in astronomy was aroused by competition with
                     the French. The French astronomer, Nicolas‐Louis de Lacaille (1713–62), who mapped the stars in the southern hemisphere from the vantage of the Cape of Good Hope in south Africa, took aim at Robur Carolinum, which honored Charles II of England. As Lacaille created numerous new constellations of his own in the southern hemisphere, he eliminated
                     the British honorific constellation, criticizing its inventor, the English astronomer
                     Edmond Halley (1656–1742), for an illogical redistribution of stars originally belonging to the ancient southern
                     constellation, Argo Navis (the Ship of the Argonauts). Restoring Roburʼs stars to the shipʼs prow, Lacaille justified uprooting Robur on ostensibly scientific grounds, given that new constellations typically were formed
                     from “unformed” stars—that is, stars ignored by Ptolemy in plotting the ancient constellations—rather than by robbing old constellations
                     of their stars for new configurations. In designing his own new constellations, Lacaille was inspired by an Enlightenment principle of honoring the modern arts and sciences
                     rather than paying tribute to individual monarchs. Historians suspect Lacaille, however, of a prejudicial view when targeting specifically a British honorific constellation,
                     while inconsistently retaining constellations that paid tribute to other nationsʼ
                     rulers (Barentine, Lost Constellations, 352–54). The rivalry persisted in Ruskinʼs time, when an 1820s British astronomy manual bitterly mocked an attempt to rename a portion of the constellation
                     Orion after Napoleon (Aspin, A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy (2d ed., 1825), 147; see Orion, contextual gloss).
         Another rivalry between British and French popular science, while not directly related
                     to astronomy, was in the news when Ruskin was composing “The Constellations“ and may have animated his choice to name the constellation Camelopardalis (the Giraffe), although he assigns it no contextualizing epithet. In 1827–28, the first living specimen of a giraffe was imported to Britain, an event that spurred competition with France, which also received a specimen (see Camelopardalis, contextual gloss). What appears a preference for constellations representing animals, birds, and fabulous
                     beasts among Ruskinʼs choices may have been prompted by the opening of the London Zoo in March 1828.
         
         
         1.7.6. Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology
         The evidence of two successive endings in the MS IA draft of “The Constellations𠇍
                     points to how astronomy led young writers to conflicts over the kinds of knowledge
                     they absorbed. Originally ending with Capricornus (the Sea‐Goat), which Ruskin set apart from the other constellation names merely
                     by adding a rhetorical flourish (see Two Successive Endings), the subsequently drafted ending introduced an awareness that knowledge--even knowledge
                     as seemingly neutral as a catalogue of names--called for a hierarchy of values:
         
         
         
         1.7.6.1. 
         
         bright these stars are, beauteous gold
         but let history unfold
         her page of learning let us see
         whether that is not more bright than thee
         een thou o beauteous mercyry
         much better than the brightest star
         virtue I will say you are
         better than history indeed
         virtue you should have the lead
         
         
         
         
         As shown by the revision of the fair copy in RF T70, even this caveat did not suffice.
                     In this peroration, Ruskin struck out "history" and substituted "knowledge", thus
                     extending the sway of "virtue" over a potentially broader scope of ways of knowing.
                     Objectionable knowledge in this poem took two forms, as suggested by the lines that
                     his mother flagged for revision and Ruskin's consequent revisions: evocations of horror
                     or violence, and examples of paganism that approached blasphemy from a Christian perspective
                     (see Margaret Ruskinʼs Role in the Fair‐Copying Process).
         In the print sources on astronomy available to Ruskin in the 1820s, the problem of
                     reconciling astronomical knowledge--scientific or "historical" (i.e., mytholological
                     and pre-Christian)--adopted a range of approaches. In Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children, Mrs. Sherwood cannot avoid the pagan, mythical names of the constellations, but she avoids alluding
                     to the myths themselves, defining the constellations neutrally as “remarkable groups
                     or clusters of stars, to which names of various figures have been given”. She does
                     not pursue the identity of the figures or their stories, presumably fearing that a
                     fascination with the myths approaches idolatry, as suggested by a quotation she delivers
                     from Chronicles: “For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods
                     of the people are idols: the Lord made the heavens” (1 Chron 16: 25–26). Instead, Mrs. Sherwood directs admiration of the stars toward Christian praise: “We find in Scripture the
                     glory of the righteous in the resurrection compared to that of the stars; by which
                     comparison we find, that their splendour will partake of that of the Son of God himselfȁ
                     (Sherwood, Introduction to Astronomy, 14, 12).
         The correlative of Mrs. Sherwood's approach, likewise avoiding the myths but from
                     an opposite source of aversion, Jeremiah Joyce in the Scientific Dialogues expresses a rationalist contempt for the fanciful patterns in the sky and their stories:

         Tutor. “Nor do I.”
         (Scientific Dialogues, vol. 2, “Of Astronomy”, Conversation 4, “Of the Ephemeris”, 2:36–37).
         
         
         
         In between these extremes, in A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy, Jehoshaphat Aspin takes a moderate path, treating the mythic origins of the constellations as useful
                     knowledge: “The names and figures are of very ancient date, and are still retained
                     for the sake of distinction, as well as to avoid confusion in comparing ancient with
                     modern observations” (A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy, 102). This functional justification does not prevent Aspin from summarizing the “fables” associated with each of the constellations—summaries
                     keyed to the cards depicting the mythical figures, which are collected in Uraniaʼs Mirror. Aspin reconciles the pagan tales with Christian revelaton by occasionally interpreting
                     the mythical figures as biblical types (in the contextual glosses on the poem, see
                     Aspin's commentary, e.g., on Orion, Draco, and Pegasus).
         Jacob Green, Aspin's American competitor for the market in illustrated guides to the
                     mythology of the constellations, and Alexander Jamieson, whose illustrations in the
                     Celestial Atlas were plagiarized by the artists for both Green's Astronomical Recreations
                     and for Urania's Mirror, were given to jousting with more specific theological controversies
                     surrounding astronomical lore. Green fumed, for example, over the controversy surrounding
                     the Zodiac of Dendera--an Egyptian stone antiquity representating the zodiac, which
                     was purloined by French agents during the Napoleonic era and believed by some savants
                     to predate the generations of Noah by thousands of years. Contradicting the biblical
                     narrative, the Zodiac of Dendera appeared to present an alignment of equinoxes with
                     constellations that the artifact's creators could have witnessed only in an ancient
                     sky from long before the Flood, as proven by calculations based on the precession
                     of the earth's poles. This controversy, which provoked a surprising investment of
                     scientific, philologial, theological, and political attention (see Buchwald and Josefowicz,
                     The Zodiac of Paris), was countered dismissively by Green with an appeal to the popular
                     theological lectures of Thomas Chalmers (see the contextual gloss on Leo (the Lion)). While Green's appeal is complacent and reactionary, Chalmers's blending of natural
                     theology and Scottish evangelicalism probably reflected the standing of Ruskin's parents
                     on questions of conflict between science and biblical authority. The family library
                     included a copy of Chalmers's Discourses on the Christian Revelation Viewed in Connection with the Modern Astronomy (1817), which sought to refute skeptical arguments that the evidence of astronomy undermines
                     the truth of Christian revelation (Dearden, Library of John Ruskin, 67 [no. 473]; for John James Ruskin's attendance at a lecture by Chalmers in 1838,
                     see Ruskin Family Letters, ed. Burd, 516, 518 n. 1).
         Within this range of solutions to reconciling secular astronomical learning with the
                     sacred, Ruskin is unequal to the third approach--an engagement with the varieties
                     of natural theology, which attempt a dialogue between science and faith--but he combines
                     the other two approaches in the conclusion to "The Constellations". First, in his
                     declaration that "history" or "knowledge" is less "bright" than "virtue", he effectively
                     adopts Mrs. Sherwood's strategy of bluntly subordinating astronomical facts to Bible
                     quotations. Comparing their treatments of the planet Mercury, which Ruskin likens
                     to virtue, one finds Mrs. Sherwood's information about that planet dominated by a
                     quotation from Acts. Paul and Barnabas, while preaching in the Roman colony of Lycaonia,
                     are horrified to be confused by their audience with pagan gods, Mercury (Hermes) and
                     Jupiter (Zeus). Amazed that Paul successfully commanded a cripple to walk, the Lycaonians
                     "lifted up their voices, saying . . . 'The gods have come down to us in the likeness
                     of men!'". The point of the episode is to condemn as idolatrous any knowledge other
                     than the apostles' witness. In Mrs. Sherwood's transcription:
         
         
         
         1.7.6.1. 
         And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.
                              Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands
                              unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people. Which when the apostles,
                              Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people,
                              crying out, and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions
                              with you, and preach unto you, that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living
                              God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein.
         (Acts 14:11-15; Sherwood, Introduction to Astronomy, 26)
         
         
         
         In the exercise that Mrs. Sherwood recommends for the use of her book, the child reader
                     is expected to memorize and recite this passage of scripture along with a few facts
                     about the planet (see Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children). No application of the scripture is invited or necessary, since the message is flattened
                     to the solitary implication that any learning is idolatrous that fails to lead to
                     praise of the Creator.
         Ruskin's comparison of "beauteous" Mercury with virtue entails an additional level
                     of interpretation, however, since his choice of Mercury implies a typological reading
                     based on knowledge that Mrs. Sherwood prohibits--the myths of Hermes. Even the story
                     from Acts requires such knowledge to explain why the Lycaonians believed Paul to be
                     Hermes, given that "he was the chief speaker". Ruskin may have found an explanation
                     in a reference work on Greek and Roman mythology known to have existed in the family
                     library, and probably acquired in the 1820s when he composed "The Constellations":
                     The Pantheon: Or, Ancient History of the Gods of Greece and Rome, by Edward Baldwin,
                     a pseudonym of William Godwin (Dearden, Library of John Ruskin, 21 [no. 136]; and for dating, see Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Untraced Books—Baldwin [pseud. William Godwin], Fables Ancient and Modern). Here, Ruskin would have found pleasure in the attributes of the god of eloquence:
         
         
         
         1.7.6.1. 
         [Mercury] "is said to be the inventor of letters; and his Greek name, Hermes, is derived
                              from a word in that language which signifies "to interpret" or "explain": in this
                              quality Mercury is the God of eloquence, as Apollo is the God of poetry: an ingenious
                              writer of the present age (John Horne Tooke, in his Diversions of Purley) has considered
                              the wings which this God annexes to his feet, as emblematical of the wings which language
                              gives to the thoughts of men.
         (Baldwin [pseud. Godwin], The Pantheon, 58)
         
         
         
         While this extended gloss identifies Mercury with oratory, Ruskin's more surprising
                     association of the deity with virtue requires examining the effects of eloquence.
                     To make this case, The Pantheon is a compelling source, since Godwin disassociates
                     Mercury from the evil uses of rhetoric, just as he exonerates the god from dishonest
                     uses of buying and selling, in his role as "inventor of traffic, . . . said to have
                     introduced the use of weights, measures, and contracts". In an exception that John
                     James Ruskin would perhaps have appreciated, Godwin argues that "licentiousness" in
                     the "Greek imagination" led them to have "indecorously represented Mercury as the
                     God of thieves", since a failing lies in human nature and in the system of traffic
                     itself, which is "too apt to degenerate into a system of fraud": "[W]hen men engage
                     in buying and selling and barter as a profession, the more keen and grasping among
                     them will endeavour to buy cheap and sell dear, and cozen and overreach those with
                     whom they have any dealings" (Baldwin [pseud. Godwin], The Pantheon, 58).
         Thus, whereas Mrs. Sherwood's exercise sets up a hierarchy of whole categories of
                     knowledge, Godwin's approach undertakes to educate the child reader's own imagination,
                     which he engages by humanizing the sacred: "There are many things related of this
                     God, which forcibly suggest to us the idea of a man, who for his great and essential
                     services to his fellow-beings, was worshipped as a divinity after his death". Mercury
                     wields magical powers by virtue of his caduceus--the winged wand coiled by two serpents, which he carries--but the magic resides
                     less in this instrument itself than in its uses, its "sovereign power in appeasing
                     quarrels and controversies":
         
         
         
         1.7.6.1. 
         if the God touched with . . . [the caduceus] two mortal enemies, they instantly began
                              to regard each other with eyes of affection: one of the earliest experiments that
                              was made of it in this respect, happened thus: two serpents were fighting with terrible
                              fierceness; their eyes flashed fire, their hissings were infernal, it seemed as if
                              the combat could end in nothing less than the destruction of both: Mercury, happening
                              to come by, touched them with his wand; they were immediately at peace; they embraced
                              each other; they wreathed themselves round the instrument of their reconciliation,
                              and remained ever after the ornament of the caduceus of the God.
         (Baldwin [pseud. Godwin], The Pantheon, 57-58)
         
         
         
         This direction of the imagination toward fellow-feeling characterizes Margaret Ruskin's
                     uses of Godwin's texts. In place of the lines of "The Constellations" that she marked
                     for revision, Ruskin substituted epithets, which reference stories of mutual help
                     and generosity taken from Godwin's Aesopian collection, Fables Ancient and Modern, Adapted for the Use of Children (see the contextual glosses on Leo [the Lion] and on Lynx).
         
         
         1.7.7. Beyond the Books: Theatrical and Other Popular Sources of Astronomical Instruction
                        in Early Victorian Britain
         It is possible that Ruskin produced this poem by relying entirely on print sources, albeit not a single source.
                     While Joyceʼs, Dayʼs, and Maria Edgeworthʼs books are proven influences, their books refer to only a handful of the constellations
                     named in Ruskinʼs poem. The addition of a tabular source like Mrs. Sherwoodʼs, combined with Ruskinʼs imagination, could account for the whole, but “The Constellations” hints at a still larger context of early Victorian astronomical instruction in the
                     form of lectures, toys, and just real‐life observation. Did Ruskin engage in actual stargazing as preparation for any part of the poem? Does the poem
                     reflect conditions of British astronomoical practice and popular education in the
                     1820s? Evidence is limited, but the introduction to astronomy provided by Ruskinʼs books itself pointed to the theatrical and real‐life entertainments that were readily
                     available to youth.
         
         1.7.7.1. The Lenten Astronomy Lecture
         After , Ruskin arrives at the Zodiac, as also mentioned in his title, which may hint at another context for his interest
                        in astronomy. As a distinct activity from professional astronomy with its mathematical
                        orientation combined with observation—the less popularly accessible approach, which
                        Joyceʼs Tutor encourages over the mythological tradition—there thrived in the 1820s a popular form of astronomy education, which combined technology with art, modern
                        science with traditional elements such as the Zodiac. The popular astronomy lecture was a theatrical entertainment, commonly known as
                        Lenten astronomy lectures since they could be held in London theaters during the holy season, when plays were forbidden. The timing of these spectacles
                        fits with the proposed April–June 1828 period for composition of “The Constellations”, which might have been initiated by attendance at a lecture. (In 1828, Easter Day fell on 6 April. John James Ruskinʼs accounts for April 1828 include “Abernethys Lectrs” for 12s, but this entry probably refers to published lectures by the surgeon, John Abernethy [1764–1831]; Account Book, 6r).
         The astronomy lecture circuit—originating in the late eighteenth century, becoming a craze in the 1820s, and remaining a staple of popular science instruction at least until mid—century—has been researched by Hsiang—Fu Huang, who finds that its performative and entrepreneurial aspects overlapped with the
                        insitutional framework of lecturing that was supposedly displacing these popular forms
                        of instruction in the 1820s (Huang, “A Shared Arena”). A target audience for the lectures included children, as Huang notes (“When Urania Meets Terpsichore”, 60–61), astronomy being regarded as an uplifting area of knowledge religiously as
                        well as scientifically. As a guidebook of London amusements solemnly assured parents about the content of Lenten astronomy lectures—even
                        as performed by George Bartley (1784–1858), who was not a scientist but a comic actor, famed for his portrayals of Shakespeareʼs Falstaff—the spectacle would convey “to the minds of their children the lofty and magnificent
                        ideas that Astronomy supplies”—namely,
         
         
         
         1.7.7.1.1. 
         Beauty, Order, and Sublimity in the Heavens, [which] appear to their expanding intellect, in all their delightful
                                 prospects; and the feelings, that will certainly influence their entrée into life, will be characterized by a marked reverence for that “Divinity which breathes
                                 within us, / And points out an after state to man”. Adults, as well as children, will
                                 derive, from this exhibition, an increased perception of the power, dignity, and ubiquity,
                                 of that Being whom we ought to serve.
         (Wellbeloved, London Lions for Country Cousins and Friends about Town, 4; on Bartley, see Huang, “When Urania Meets Terpsichore”, 54–57)
         
         
         
         Even as educational entertainments for children, however, the Lenten astronomy lectures
                        were regarded with some criticism by educators, as Ruskin would have known from Maria Edgeworthʼs Frank. After Frank has attempted and failed on his own to construct an orrery, a model of the solar system, his parents take him and his cousin Mary to an astronomy lecture at a theater. The performance features something like the
                        large—scale, illuminated or “transparent” stage orreries with Greek—inspired names
                        like Eidouranion, which combined the older mechanical, three—dimensional orrery that reproduced the
                        revolutions of the sun and planets with transparancies projected by a magic lantern
                        (see Huang, “When Urania Meets Terpsichore”, 49–51, 66 n. 23). For Edgeworth, criticism of these spectacles pertains not just to quack lecturers and creaky, dysfunctional
                        orreries, which Huang finds in satires of the day (“When Urania Meets Terpsichore”, 62–63); more fundamentally, Edgeworth points to conflicts with reformersʼ principles of effective pedagogy.
         The theatrical spectacle is a grand but passive presentation, discouraging learning
                        through experience and self—discovery. Even though Frank had failed to complete his own orrery because he over—reached his abilities, the
                        stage orrery is “particularly interesting to Frank” thanks only to “the pains he had taken, and the various attempts he had made, to
                        understand and to represent” the revolving bodies. The other “little children” in
                        the audience went “dead asleep” and “even he”, Frank, “after all his reading in Scientific Dialogues, had much difficulty sometimes in understanding both the machine and the lecturer”.
                        Edgeworthʼs most severe criticism is aimed at the failure to scale knowledge to the age—appropriate
                        accessibility of young listeners. The lecturer overwhelms the audience “with a vast
                        number of words, which” Frank “strained his attention” to understand, trusting that the lengthy explanations “were
                        all necessary”, yet “of which nearly half were nothing to the purpose” and put Mary to sleep altogether. As for the London guidebookʼs promise of the theatrical augmentation of Beauty, Order, and Sublimity,
                        it is the sight of the real moon on the ride home that prompts a spontaneous reaction
                        from Mary: “‘How beautiful!’ said she: ‘and how—’ sublime! she would have said, but she did
                        not know the word well enough: she knew the feeling.” Feelings are represented as accessible, regardless of age and learning; and despite Edgeworthʼs promotion of the Industrial Sublime in Harry and Lucy Concluded, here Frank responds to Maryʼs admiration: “How wonderful! What is the orrery compared to this, Mary! . . . How grand! how different from any thing that the most ingenious man in this
                        world can make!” (Edgeworth, Frank: A Sequel, 2:251, 253, 255, 249, 256, 257).
         The opposite effect on children was promised by promoters of astronomy as a theatrical
                        spectacle: astronomical science in particular, it was argued, benefits by the intervention
                        of art. According to the 1826 guidebook, astronomy lectures are the epitome science enhanced of metropolitan “improvements
                        and amusements”:
         
         
         
         1.7.7.1.1. 
         Astronomy, universally acknowledged the most sublime and interesting of those sciences
                                 which admit of popular illustration, is doubly valuable for its powerful influence
                                 and effect in the general improvement of the human mind. . . . {T}he science of astronomy
                                 is . . . the very science of which a popular display may most successfully be aided
                                 by the ornamental arts. Music, painting, sculpture, may be called in as auxiliaries,
                                 with powerful effect, and manifest benefit; a tasteful introduction of poetry may
                                 be deemed almost essential to success; and we would undertake that Urania need not
                                 disdain the co—operation of Terpsichore herself.
         (Wellbeloved, London Lions for Country Cousins and Friends about Town, 3; see Huang, “When Urania Meets Terpsichore”, 47)
         
         
         
         Wellbeloved devotes two pages describing in detail how a new “hydraulic” orrery has improved
                        on older “instruments . . . hitherto . . . constructed by a complication of wheel—work,
                        which, although extremely ingenious, are nevertheless almost unequal to the imitation
                        of those equable, silent, and undeviating movements, which characterize the grandest
                        works of the Creator”. Yet, despite the interest the reader is assumed to take in two close pages of technical
                        description of how hydraulic improvements have brought the orrery closer to the operations
                        of the Creator, the accompanying engraving sets the machine in a “design of our own”—a moonlit natural
                        landscape like the scene that impresses Mary and Frank as tending to the disadvantage of technology (London Lions for Country Cousins and Friends about Town, 6–7).
         Despite these conflicts with the Edgeworthian basis of Ruskinʼs education, some elements of the Lenten lectures correspond to Ruskinʼs poem. The lectures appear to have presented a somewhat uniform set of topics. In
                        Edgeworthʼs fictional treatment, the topics resemble those listed in An Epitome of Astronomy . . . as Illustrated by the Eidouranion, a pamphlet published to accompany lectures by the Walker family, first published
                        in 1782 and here quoted from the edition of 1812:
         
         Scene 1. “The Sun and Earth: with the Zodiacal Constellations” (p. 6). 
                           
         “This scene is surrounded by transparent paintings of the twelve signs of the Zodiac,
                                 shewing how the Sun, or rather the Earth, enters and passes through Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, &c.” (p. 8).
         
         
         Scene 2. “Sun, Earth, and Moon: Phases and Eclipses” (p. 9).
         Scene 3. “Theory of Tides” (p. 13) 
                           
         In Frank: A Sequel, “By this time the lecturer had come to an explanation of the cause of the tides,
                                 which neither Mary nor Frank could comprehend. His father judiciously and kindly took them out to rest their attention,
                                 and refresh themselves while this lasted. They went into a cool room, where they eat
                                 oranges and biscuits, and drank lemonade, till the tides were over” (2:252).
         
         
         Scene 4. “The Solar System” (p. 16), including “Four New Planets” (p. 23) and “Comets” (p. 29).
         Last Scene. This final scene is not announced in the pamphlet by a separate heading, as is the
                           case with the four preceding scenes, but embedded in a peroration on the infinitude
                           of the universe: “. . . how in adequate must the utmost stretch of finite faculties
                           be to represent infinity! The stars, disposed in constellations, and surrounded by
                           concentric circles, may perhaps assist the imagination a little: The attempt in the
                           LAST SCENE, if not admired, we hope will be forgiven. But was it possible we could actually
                           take our flight into infinite space, or be borne on the wings of lightning, to the
                           most distant fixed Star we can now see, even there, perhaps we should find ourselves
                           on the confines of creation, and see as many stars before us as we left behind! For
                           space has neither top nor bottom in it; it is a circle whose centre is every where,
                           but whose circumference is no where!” (pp. 36–37).
         
         According to this description, the “Last Scene”, at least as delivered by the Walker family, which by 1828 had passed into the management of Deane Franklin Walker (1778–1865 [Huang, “When Urania Meets Terpsichore”, 50]), the most comprehensive view of the constellations was presented as the finale.
                        Could Ruskin have conceived of his poem as an ekphrastic version of this final, totalizing scene?
                        Apparently, in this show, a transparency exhibited a circle of the starry night, surrounded
                        by concentric rings to suggest infinitude. In an engraving by I. Stow (ca. 1770–1823), after E. F. Burney (1760–1848), The proscenium of the English Opera House in the Strand, (Late Lyceum.) as it appeared on the Evening of the 21st March 1817, with Walkerʼs Exhibition of the Eidouranion, published by Robert Wilkinson, Scene 1 represented the earth and sun by turning the orbit vertically to the audience,
                        enclosing this revolution of the Eidouranion within a projection of an outer ring,
                        which showed the Zodiac constellations. The Zodiac constellations were represented by their respective mythological figures. Perhaps
                        the transparency for the Last Scene exhibited a similar ring of constellations in
                        their mythological guise, which Ruskin in his way has reproduced.
         The beginning of the poem, however, starts with a version of Scene 1 in the Walkersʼ
                        exhibition—or more precisely, a portion of their Scene 4—with the rising and setting
                        of Venus and Mars. As noted earlier, the poem is atypical of Dayʼs and Joyceʼs introductions to the constellations, which begin with finding the circumpolar constellations
                        in the sky. Ruskin incorporates that observation as the second stage of his poem. The Zodiac constellations form a distinct piece within the poem. The most significant point
                        to draw from the context of the Lenten astronomy lectures is that Ruskinʼs catalogue may have attempted a sublime totality, an expression of religious awe.
