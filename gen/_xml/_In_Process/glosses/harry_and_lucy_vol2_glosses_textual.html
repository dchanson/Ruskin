                    Ruskin encases the first line of the title in a rectangle, 
                    which includes scrolls or leaf ornaments, as if imitating a cartouche in a printed book. 
                    He also places the numeral <i>2</i> on opposite ends of the rectangle, 
                    both as ornamentation and declaration of his second volume.</div></span><br><br>

                  <div class="p"><b>Unidentified superscript mark (<span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>)—</b>The meaning 
                    of the superscript character between the <i>l</i> and the <i>s</i> is obscure. 
                    Perhaps Ruskin started to form an apostrophe but stopped as he realized his error in making a plural into a possessive.</div></span><br><br>
               
               <a id="DOUBLE-PERIOD-QUOTATIONMARK" class="anchor-control gloss-padding-fix"></a><span>
                  <div class="p"><b>Double period followed by a single or double quotation mark (<span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>)—</b>Ruskin 
                    uses this baffling punctuation several times in this second volume of "Harry and Lucy", 
                    consisting of two punctuation marks that in themselves are usages apparently of his own invention and obscure in their purpose--one, 
                    the double period; and the other, a closing quotation mark unaccompanied by an opening quotation mark, whether double or single 
                    (see <a href="/notes/editorial_rationale_note#COMMA" target="_self">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology: Element, Attribute, and Value Usage—Commas, Periods, Quotation Marks, and Other Punctuation</a>). 
                    It is unclear whether Ruskin brought these two miarks together to form a distinct, single punctuation mark--a punctuation enhanced, in at least two examples, by the addition of a third element, a vertical line--or 
                    whether Ruskin considered the elements as retaining their separate functions. Whatever his exact intention or the origin of the invention, 
                    a consistent usage in "Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2" appears to signify a break in the narrative, a shift from one episode to another.</div></span><br><br>
               
               <a id="DOUBLE-PERIOD" class="anchor-control gloss-padding-fix"></a><span>

                    see <a href="/notes/editorial_rationale_note#COMMA" target="_self">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology: Element, Attribute, and Value Usage—Commas, Periods, Quotation Marks, and Other Punctuation</a>.</div></span><br><br>

                  <div class="p"><b>Closing quotation mark unaccompanied by opening quotation mark (<span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>)—</b>Similarly 
                        to the case described above of the double period combined with a closing quotation mark, 
                        Ruskin combines a single period with a closing quotation mark that lacks pairing with an opening quotation mark. 
                        Again, the usage appears meant to signal the closure of an episode. The quotation mark is unrelated to direct or even indirect discourse.</div></span><br><br>

                        "Harry and Lucy", Ruskin slants print lettering in imitation of italic typeface. The purpose might be to add emphasis or as in the instance of 
                        the (misspelled) place name  to imitate the appearance of print sources such as travel guides.</div></span><br><br>

                  <div class="p"><b>“new” (<span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>)—</b>As in the previous case of mistaken overwriting, Ruskin 
                        originally wrote <i>now</i> in pencil but incorrectly traced <i>new</i> in ink.</div></span><br><br>

                        letter <i>i</i> is doubled, Ruskin perhaps starting to complete the word before realizing he must divide the syllables 
                        to maintain his right-margin justification.</div></span><br><br>
