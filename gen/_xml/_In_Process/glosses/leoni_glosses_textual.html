                    undecided about a name for the castle, Ruskin left a gap for the name to be filled later.

                    perhaps indicates that here, like the gap left at the beginning of the story to be filled in with the name of the old man, 
                    Ruskin had temporized over the name of Giulietta's brother, as well</div></span><br><br>
