                  <div class="p"><b>Chapter divisions (MS I)—</b>Chapter divisions are Ruskin's addition to his imitation 
                    of the physical and design features of Edgeworth's text, as are his "frontispiece" and "plates". In the first edition (1825) of Harry and Lucy Concluded, 
                    which Ruskin owned (see <a href="/notes/boyhood_books_note" target="_self">Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Youth</a>), 
                    episodes are divided simply by a horizontal bar, and no pictures or diagrams embellish the text. Beginning in chapter III, 
                    Ruskin does adopt the typographical treatment used to highlight the start of section divisions in Edgeworth's text.</div></span><br><br>

                    In the transcription, end-of-line horizontal marks that are not notated as justification marks are hyphens connecting syllables of words broken between lines, 
                    as will be evident where they occur. Occasionally, Ruskin drops word-break hyphens to the beginning of the line following the beginning of the word division. 
                    More often, he breaks words without using a hyphen at all.</div></span><br><br>

                  <div class="p"><b>“<span class="doubleletter-fill">Y</span>es” (MS I)—</b>Ruskin appears to have modeled his decorative capital <i>Y</i> 
                    on the font of large capitals used on the title page of Maria Edgeworth, Harry and Lucy Concluded (1825). See the <i>Y</i> in "<span class="caps">EARLY</span>".

                    his dialogue, Ruskin writes an ambiguously shaped mark that might be taken for a question mark or an exclamation mark. 
                    We have interpreted the mark as one or the other, depending on context, but its meaning is unclear.</div></span><br><br>

                    two horizontal marks might be interpreted as two successive justification marks (an unprecedented use between two words, much less one between two letters within a word), 
                    or the longer mark might be interpreted as a dash and only the second as a justification mark 
                    (see <a href="/notes/editorial_rationale_note#JUSTIFICATION" target="_self">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology: Element, Attribute, and Value Usage—Justification, Runover, and Word Division</a>). 
                    In Harry and Lucy Concluded, Edgeworth does use a dash to express a speaker's pause for emphasis.</div></span><br><br>

                  <div class="p"><b>Ending quotation mark above horizontal line (MS I)—</b>This 
                    mark may be Ruskin's attempt to imitate Edgeworth's use of a dash <i>followed by</i> a closing quotation mark, 
                    which is used in Harry and Lucy Concluded to represent a pause or speech broken off, although Ruskin's usage does not appear to conform with this meaning.</div></span><br><br>

                  <div class="p"><b>“deafing” (MS I)—</b>Probably a misspelling rather than a dialect usage

                    by reducing the size of the letters, but then apparently decided to sacrifice right-justification to clarity by overwriting the syllable with larger letters.</div></span><br><br>

                    Harry and Lucy Concluded contains no chapter divisions, sections are separated by a horizontal bar, and initial words are highlighted 
                    typographically with a capital and small capitals--a treatment that, beginning with this chapter, Ruskin imitates and further embellishes 
                    with his "double letter" style.</div></span><br><br>

                    Ruskin having started to complete the word <i>merrilly</i> on this line, but instead placed the suffix at the top of p. 26.</div></span><br><br>

                    Ruskin has once previously used a carefully drawn comma as terminal punctuation. Here for the first time he uses a comma 
                    as nonterminal punctuation, and does so a second time in the line at the bottom of this page. 
                    More or less correct usage of commas--at least, in the middle of sentences, rather than at the end--remains rare 
                    in "Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I", next occurring on pp. 29, 33.</div></span><br><br>

                  <div class="p"><b>Caret (MS I)—</b>For the first time, Ruskin uses a caret to signify 
                    where an insertion above the line belongs; however, he has drawn it upside down.</div></span><br><br>

                    has been torn out and reattached, using a gummed strip (see MS I: Description). 
                    Since the tear line fits the remaining stub, the leaf evidently was not moved here from elsewhere. 
                    Gummed strips can be found put to a similar use in W. G. Collingwood’s proof sheets for Poems (1891) (RF MS 70), 
                    so he may have been responsible for this crude but effective mending.</div></span><br><br>

                    Ruskin scored through "4" and replaced the number with "5". The number <i>4</i> would have been correct 
                    in the current condition of MS I, with its missing leaf, pp. 30-31. Changed to <i>5</i>, 
                    the plate numbering suggests that the missing leaf contained a plate, numbered plate 4. Taking speculation further afield, 
                    another possibility is opened up by Ruskin's having left p. 25 blank, the verso of the page containing plate 3. 
                    Did he mean to add a plate to this space, which would have been plate 4?</div></span><br><br>

                  <div class="p"><b>Caret (MS I)—</b>For a second time, Ruskin uses the caret symbol, 
                    again drawn upside down, and multiplied three in a row apparently in order to extend the width of the insertion, which is set above the line.</div></span><br><br>

                  <div class="p"><b>Justification mark(?) andn caret (MS I)—</b>The horizontal mark before the suffix <i>ly</i> 
                    may be meant as a justification mark, but the function of the (upside-down) caret can only be guessed. Possibly, having stretched out the word 
                    <i>Presently</i> using a justification mark to fill the line, Ruskin felt he needed to tie the suffix securely to the base word.</div></span><br><br>

                  <div class="p"><b>“he showed to Lucy” (MS I)—</b>This phrase appears to have been crowded onto this line 
                    after the centered "chap 7" heading was already in place. Since the insertion is necessary to complete the dependent clause begun on the line above, 
                    and not an afterthought extending the sentence, it serves as evidence that Ruskin fair-copied the text in MS I from a draft (not extant). Only an omission 
                    in copying, not in composition, explains the insertion logically.</div></span><br><br>
