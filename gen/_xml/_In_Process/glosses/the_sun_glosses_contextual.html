                    perhaps means that these heavenly bodies attend on the sun by following a path close to the sunʼs ecliptic. 
                    As the <span class="persName-fictional-TUTORJJ">Tutor</span> explains in <span class="persName-JJ">Jeremiah Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="title-book-JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><i>Scientific Dialogues</i></span>, the moon “is always either in the ecliptic, 
                    or within five degrees and a third of it on one side or the other. The planets also, by which I mean, <span class="name--MERCURY">Mercury</span>, 
                    <span class="name--VENUSPLANET">Venus</span> [the “Evening Star”}, <span class="name--MARS">Mars</span>, <span class="name--JUPITER">Jupiter</span>, <span class="name--SATURN">Saturn</span>, and the <span class="name--URANUS">Herschel [Uranus]</span>, are never more than eight degrees distant from the line of the ecliptic”. 
                    His pupil then asking to trace the ecliptic in relation to the fixed stars, the <span class="persName-fictional-TUTORJJ">Tutor</span> describes the constellations of the zodiac 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES" target="_self"><span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>, <span class="title-book-JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><i>Scientific Dialogues</i></span></a>, “Of Astronomy”, conversation 3, <span class="title-lesson-JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUESECLIPTIC">“Of the Fixed Stars, and Ecliptic”</span>, 2:28–29). 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, however, does not identify constellations in the zodiac; instead, he names prominent constellations that, unlike the seasonal ones in the zodiac, 
                    remain visible throughout the year, and that are commonly chosen as starting points in lessons about the night sky. <span class="name--ORION">Orion</span> lies along the celestial equator, and therefore, in the northern hemisphere, appears high in sky for part of year, and low for the remainder. 
                    The rest are circumpolar constellations, revolving around the <span class="name--POLARIS">“North Star”</span> (Polaris)—<span class="name--URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major (Great Bear)</span>, 
                    of which the <span class="name--PLOUGH">“Plough”</span> or <span class="name--CHARLESSWAIN">“Charlesʼs Wain”</span> forms a part; 
                    <span class="name--URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor (“Lesser” Bear)</span>; and <span class="name--CORONABOREALIS">Corona Borealis (“Northern Crown”)</span>.</div></span><br><br>
