                    (<span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>)—</b>Ruskin's drawing of Harry's steamboat 
                    resembles the first steam-powered commercial packets, which were driven by paddlewheels on each side of the vessel,
                    but which also carried sails. The first such vessel to be successful was The Comet (1812), 
                    which initially operated on the Clyde River in Scotland, ferrying between Glasgow and Greenock. 
                    The Comet then toured Scotland in order to stir interest in steam voyaging, and it ended up in 1816 operating on the Firth of Forth. 
                    Its single tall funnel was sturdy enough to double as a mast (Batchelor and Chant, Complete Encyclpedia of Steamships, 32-33). 
                    Ruskin's drawing does not show a sail attached to his steamboat's chimney, 
                    but his actual experience of steam travel on water--and according to his autobiography, Praeterita, 
                    he sailed by steam with his parents as early as age three (see Tours of 1822-24)--would not necessarily 
                    have been aboard the famous Comet, since by that time its success had inspired construction of dozens of steam passenger vessels by the 1820s.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">What Ruskin's Harry means by crossing the "sea" is unclear. The phrase "across the sea", if it reflects actual experience at all, 
                        could refer to crossing the Bristol Channel. Ruskin's drawing, "picture of the Bristol channel", later in "Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2" (p. 15), 
                        depicts two steamboats among other craft, one close to the viewer and the other in the distance. 
                        The nearer vessel is chugging into (or out of) the scene, its smokestack parallel with the frame of the picture, 
                        seeming to impinge on a world of sail represented by a ship with three masts in full sail, which is towing a smaller craft. 
                        The Ruskin family could have boarded a sidewheeler steam packet in the course of their Wye Tour of 1827, 
                        described in his second volume of Harry and Lucy, or their aborted Tour of 1828, which was interrupted when they had reached Plymouth. '
                        The first regular passenger service in this region was established between Bath and Bristol in 1813, 
                        and extended into the Bristol Channel in 1822. By the end of the 1820s, several routes were established around the channel 
                        including a crossing from Bristol to Chepstow on the Wye River (Farr, West Country Passenger Steamers, 2-3; 
                        Coombes, Passenger Steamers of the Bristol Channel, 7).</div></span><br><br>

                    from Jeremiah Joyce's Scientific Dialogues with the Witch of the Alps episode from Byron's Manfred, he does not ascribe a time of day to the events; 
                    however, since Ruskin begins that final chapter of volume one by placing Harry on the beach in the morning, digging seashells, the subsequent events would logically last until noon. 
                    More compelling, however, is the time of day in Byron's Witch of the Alps scene, 
                    which commences when "[i]t is not noon" and therefore "the Sunbow's rays still arch / The torrent with the many hues of heaven"

                  <div class="p"><b>“salt hill” (<span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>)—</b>In 
                        Ruskin's time, Salt Hill was a village situated a mile west of Slough, within the old borders of Buckinghamshire. Known for its inns, 
                        the village was reached along the so-called Bath Road or Great West Road that led from London to Bristol. 
                        For the young traveller Ruskin, the place featured poetic and scientific associations. 
                        The vicinity offered views of Eton and Windsor Castle to the south, which brought to mind Thomas Gray's (1716-71)
                        "Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College"; and a Norman church, St. Laurence's, in the village of Upton, was claimed as the original 
                        of Gray's church tower and churchyard inspiring "Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard". 
                        Since Ruskin was studying astronomy at this time, he may also have remarked the house belonging to Sir William Herschel (1738-1822), 
                        "in the garden of which his great telescope was set up; here most of his discoveries were made, including that of the planet Uranus". 
                        At the time of an 1860 guidebook, "[t]he tube of the telescope alone remain[ed] on the spot"; at the time of the Ruskins' Tour of 1827, 
                        Herschel had been dead for only five years and buried in St. Laurence's churchyard 
                        (Hare, Handbook for Travellers in Berks, Bucks, and Oxfordshire, 95).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">The name Salt Hill also refers to a tumulus within the village, which was the site of a "singular custom celebrated at Eton school, every third year, 
                        on Whit Tuesday, under the name of the <i>Montem</i>". As described in a guidebook of the 1820s, a "procession is made to a tumulus, 
                        near the Bath road, which has acquired the name of Salt-hill, by which also the neighbouring inns have long been known. 
                        The chief object of this <i>ceremony</i>, which has of late years been conducted with more decorum than formerly, 
                        is to collect money for <i>salt</i>, as the phrase is, from all persons travelling on the road. 
                        The scholars who collect the money are called <i>salt-bearers</i>, and are dressed in rich silk habits. 
                        'Tickets, inscribed with some motto, by way of password, are given to such persons as have already paid for <i>salt</i>, 
                        as a security from any further demands. The procession has been frequently honoured with the presence of his Majesty and the royal family, 
                        whose liberal contributions, added to those of many of the nobility and others, who have been educated at Eton, 
                        and purposely attend the meeting, have so far augmented the collection, that it has been known to amount to more than 800£. 
                        The sum so collected is given to the senior-scholar, who is going off to Cambridge, for his support at the university"

                        approaching the city from the east ("London to Bath" and "London to Gloucester", Mogg, Paterson's Roads, 97, 119). Alternatively, 
                        from Maidenhead they could have continued west to cross the river at Henley on Thames and then turn northwest via Watlington, 
                        approaching Oxford from the south ("London to Worcester through Henley and Oxford", Mogg, Peterson's Roads, 114). Either way, 
                        the traveling distance from Maidenhead to Oxfore would have amounted to 30-32 miles.</div></span><br><br>

                        the entrance from the east was described as follows in The Oxford Visitor (ca. 1821), 
                        an illustrated collection of "picturesque views" drawn, engraved, and probably written by
                        the father-and-son team of topographical artists, James Storer (1771-1853) and Henry Sargant Storer (1796-1837):

                        and St. Mary's Churches, and those of Christ Church College to the left. 
                        On passing over the Bridge, and proceeding up High Street, the fronts of several colleges, churches, and private dwellings are gradually and successively unfolded to the sight. 
                        The street is broad and long,--it has a gentle bend, or curve, along its whole extent. 
                        At every step the passenger is struck with new objects and fine combinations; 
                        and what with the tower of Caerfax, &c. completing the vista at the extremity of the above side-scenery, 
                        on both hands,--the whole 'forms a street-scene of unrivalled variety and beauty'". The entrance from the south, "though not so grand", 
                        led "from meadows, over three or four bridges", to Ruskin's future college--"the noble towers and turrets of Christ Church, with its stately avenue of elms"

                        decade later, the Ruskins referred to the Angel Hotel, 84 High Street, as their usual accommodations in Oxford 
                        (Margaret to John James Ruskin, 23 December 1836, in Burd, Ruskin Family Letters, 385, and see 424 n. 1). 
                        The Angel originated under that name in the early 1500s, and a portion of its frontage on the High Street survives today, 
                        as shown on the website, Oxford History: The High, along with an engraving of the hotel as the Ruskins would have viewed it in the 1820s. 
                        Until its trade declined with the advent of rail, the Angel was Oxford's principal coaching inn, 
                        with "coaches depart[ing] in all directions from 3 a.m. until midnight every day, including Sundays". 
                        It would not have been unusual, therefore, to arrive here "so very late", as Ruskin describes, if this was their inn. 
                        The Angel was also highly respectable, described in the 1830s as the "fashionable hotel" where even royalty sometimes lodged
