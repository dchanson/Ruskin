                    by <span class="persName-ME">Maria Edgeworth</span>, <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span> “began counting to [his cousin] <span class="persName-fictional-MARYME">Mary</span> all the stars, 
                    whose names he had lately learned”. In <span class="persName-fictional-FRANKME">Frank</span>ʼs case, he brings shame on himself for showing off, 
                    “talking of . . . [the stars] as if they were all his own familiar acquaintance, 
                    and had scarcely been heard of by any body else in the world”. While an episode like this in <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>ʼs 
                    <span class="title-series-EDGEWORTHEARLYLESSONS"><i>Early Lessons</i></span> series may in part be behind the “lesson book”

                    these tales do not contain data of the kind that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> sourced to compile lists of constellation names 
                    and corresponding numbers in his <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">third volume of “Harry and Lucy Concluded”</span>.

                    “The figures” does not follow the specifications for constructing
                    the theater; rather, first there occurs the one‐sentence paragraph about the
                    macaw (incomplete?), and then occurs “The figures. . . .” Some
                    confusion between draft and fair copy at this point might have contributed to
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs discouragement with the project.</span><br><br>
