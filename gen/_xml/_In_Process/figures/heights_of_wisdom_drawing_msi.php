                        only “those who are themselves children, or . . . those who know children right well” will credit 
                        <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-LUCYME">Lucy</span>ʼs “sudden falls from the heights of wisdom to the depths of folly”. The protagonists 
                        have been engaged in well‐regulated learning: <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span> has been teaching <span class="persName-fictional-LUCYME">Lucy</span> the mechanics of air pumps, 
                        using a pump made of glass in order to exhibit its inner workings. “How did <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-LUCYME">Lucy</span> spend 
                        the remainder of this morning, two whole hours?” the narrator asks. They spoil the glass pump by 
                        setting it to work in a muddy puddle, and they soil their clothing so badly that they are forced 
                        to hide in a tree to avoid their <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMAME">mother</span>ʼs summons to greet unexpected visitors. To their consternation, 
                        their shame and bashfulness cost them an interesting account of a shipwreck, which the visitors related. 
                        <span class="persName-fictional-HARRYME">Harry</span> and <span class="persName-fictional-LUCYME">Lucy</span> beg their <span class="persName-fictional-MAMMAME">mother</span> to repeat the story, but she refuses lest they lose this motivation to overcome 
                        their follies of bashfulness and carelessness with their things (1:103, and see 103–14).</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Assuming that the source is correctly identified, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> can be seen translating a didactic narrative into an emblematic picture 
                        by dispensing with the narrative details and fixing on the simple pictorial contrast of “heights of wisdom” and 
                        “depths of folly”. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs edition of <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span> was not illustrated (see

                        however, emblems were familiar to him from illustrations in other childrenʼs books, such as 
                        <span class="title-anthology-SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALES"><i>Christmas Tales</i></span> by 
                        <span class="persName-fictional-SOBERSIDES">Solomon Sobersides</span>. 
                        Its frontispiece represents Wisdom and Folly competing to lead the steps of youth, as explained by an accompanying text: 
                        “See here the Youth, by Wisdom led, / The Paths of Life, securely tread; / The dangʼrous Lures of Folly shun, / 
                        And Virtueʼs Course serenely run.”</div>

                        “A masterpiece of its kind”, the engraving shows “Wisdom (looking rather like Britannia) giving a book to a young boy,
