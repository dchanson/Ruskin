            <h1 class="page-title">Library Edition</h1>
            
            <div class="p">Edited by E. T. Cook and Alexander Wedderburn, and published
                    1903–12 by George Allen, this 39-volume set was the first collected edition of Ruskinʼs works to attempt
                    comprehensiveness. Allen himself oversaw production and release of
                    several volumes before his death in 1907.</div>
            
            <div class="p">The Library Edition presented a
                    significant departure from the first collected edition, the Works Series, which
                    Ruskin dramatically limited in scope. The new edition aimed at collecting all of
                    the published works, along with a considerable extent of unpublished materials
                    such as drafts, letters, and diary extracts.</div>
            
            <div class="p">Despite these aims of comprehensiveness, the results for the early works were
                    mixed. The first two volumes containing Early Prose (vol. 1 ) and Poems (vol.
                    2 [1903]) were hurried along by Allen, who was anxious to prevent subscribers
                    from perceiving default of the edition. He thus caused the editors, Wedderburn
                    and Cook, to rely heavily on Allenʼs previously published editions
                    of early works and, especially in the case of the early prose, to cobble
                    together compilations of the earlier “editing.” The
                    volume of Poems, too, shows the seams between merely reprinting W. G.
                    Collingwoodʼs work on the Poems of 1891 and attempting to deliver on
                    the editionʼs promises by expanding on that earlier editorial
                    work.</div>
            
            
            <div class="p">Motivations for the unprecedented comprehensiveness of the edition were both financial and philosophical.
                    Wedderburn, as one of Ruskinʼs three literary trustees, urged as
                    early as March, 1900, following Ruskinʼs death in January, that
                    copyrights of Ruskinʼs published books be extended by inclusion of
                    new material. This would profit himself, who stood to gain by terms of
                    Ruskinʼs will, and George Allen, who as publisher gained by terms of
                    his former agreement with Ruskin. Of the two other trustees, Joan Severn and
                    Charles Eliot Norton, the former looked forward to profit while the latter
                    dissented, expressing a fundamentally different editorial philosophy from
                    Wedderburnʼs. For Norton, guided by  Ruskinʼs
                    procedure in the Works Series, the editorʼs responsibility was to
                    omit all materials except those he judged important and even to destroy
                    manuscript materials that might prove embarrassing to a writerʼs
                    reputation.</div>
            
            <div class="p">W. G. Collingwood, who as editor of Poems (1891) had demonstrated sound editorial
                    abilities, but who, unlike Wedderburn, gained nothing as an editor by terms of
                    Ruskinʼs will, repudiated what he saw as Wedderburnʼs
                    and the Severnsʼ greed, while agreeing with Wedderburn in editorial
                    philosophy. This
                    left Wedderburn, Allen, and Joan Severn as collaborators on the new edition, who
                    projected a profit of £30,000 to be split as even thirds.</div>
            
            <div class="p">Norton remained critical of what he saw
                    as “gripe– all –characters”  in
                    Wedderburn and Allen (quoted in Dearden, “Library Edition of John
                    Ruskin,” 53), but he tended to exempt Joan Severn from greed,
                    (because she was a woman?)  For Allen, surely, the project represented not only
                    new profits but also an opportunity for fine bookmaking. His first endeavor was
                    to commission handmade paper watermarked with Ruskinʼs monogram and
                    coat of arms, designed by W. H. Hooper ().</div>
            
            <div class="p">With Collingwood distancing himself from the scheme, Wedderburn required a
                    collaborator with editorial experience, whom he found in E. T. Cook. Although
                    Cook was responsible for the greater part of editorial labor, Wedderburn always
                    treated his coeditor with condescension, paying him £1,500 for ten years of
                    scholarship.</div>
            
            <div class="p">Cook worked from typed and longhand transcripts, bound in red cloth (now at
                    Bodleian and RL), made by .</div>
            
            <div class="p"> According to the “Publisherʼs Notice”
                    announcing completion of the edition (where is this?)  , 2,062 sets were produced,
                    with 2,000 for sale. Each volume in the standard maroon Holliston cloth cost 1
                    guinea (more for special bindings), which subscribers could pay on receipt of
                    each volume, although separate volumes were not for sale apart from a set. By
                    1912, on completion of the series, sales had slowed sufficiently that remaining
                    unbound sheets were sold to Encyclopedia Britannica, which issued sets in blue
                    cloth along with the special incentive of a separately bound Ruskin letter
                    (supplied by the Allen family). When George Allen & Company was
                    reorganized as George Allen & Unwin in 1914, remaining bound copies
                    passed to the new company, which continued to sell them.</div>
