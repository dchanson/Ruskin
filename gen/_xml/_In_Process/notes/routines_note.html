               <div class="p">Daily routine in the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> household or during family travels can elude recovery, 
                    since rituals tend to be remarked only in the breach, and in any case likely changed over time. 
                    Some evidence of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs daily life in boyhood can be assembled, however, and perhaps contextualized.</div>

                  <div class="p">In his <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">“Harry and Lucy Concluded”</span> narratives, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> repeatedly records times for <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">“Harry</span>ʼs” lessons and play periods 
                         in relation to the meals of dinner and tea. According to <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I”</span>, 
                         <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span> “always went to his lessons at twelve” (chap. 9) at least when vacationing at <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span>, 
                         having spent the morning playing on the beach or taking a walk with his father. Noon lessons preceded the midday meal of dinner, 
                         which occurred around 3:00 p.m. This time is evidenced by <span class="persName-fictional-HARRY">Harry</span>ʼs disorientation on the longest day of the year, the summer soltice, 
                         when the lingering light caused evening tea to arrive “seemingly at three o‐clock”—the dinner time—instead of its proper time of 7:00 p.m. (chap. 8). 
                         Similarly, according to <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL2">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”</span>, a disorientation hinges on this mealtime, 
                         when “[a]fter dinner” he “had to learn his lessons” again because they had been 
                         “quite driven them out of his head. But he learned them so quickly that he had from three to nine to play 
                         but he did not play he spent from three to half past it in learning his lessons for tomorrow 
                         and spent the rest in drawing took tea and went to bed” (chap. 1).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">Dinner at three in the afternoon, as <span class="persName-JUDITHFLANDERS">Judith Flanders</span> shows, 
                         was considered an older convention in the <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth‐century</span>—observed, for example, 
                         by <span class="persName-fictional-DORASPENLOW">Dora Spenlow</span>ʼs old‐fashioned maiden aunts in <span class="title-book-DICKENSDAVIDCOPPERFIELD"><i>David Copperfield</i></span>, 
                         who correspondingly take their tea at six‐thirty in the evening. 
                         Fashionable life later in the century called for evening dining at six or seven. 
                         Even the elder Ruskins, when entertaining, liked an evening dinner, so <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> 
                         could sit up until midnight talking with friends. When married, <span class="persName-JR">John</span> and <span class="persName-ECG">Effie</span> 
                         apparently set an unusually early dinner of one in the afternoon at their house in 
                         <span class="placeName-building-PARKST">Park Street</span>, <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, 
                         followed by an evening tea. This meal schedule perhaps revolved around <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs work, 
                         just as meals were timed with his lessons in boyhood
