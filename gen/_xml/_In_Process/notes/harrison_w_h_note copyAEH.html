                    writing and editing as his primary income: in his reminiscences, he mentions
                    holding positions in connection with banking houses, and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> seats him at a

                    34:99), referring apparently to the Crown Life Assurance Company,
                    which existed from at least the early <span class="date-1830-1839">1830</span> at New Bridge
                    Street, <span class="placeName-BLACKFRIARS">Blackfriars</span>. (In <span class="date-1856-1858">1856–58</span>, the building was handsomely

                    Like the Ruskin family in the <span class="date-1830-1849">1830s–40</span>s, the Harrisons resided in

            <div class="p">When the Ruskins first became acquainted with <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> in 18, he would have
                    been able to regale them with reports of conversation with such relics of
                    Regency literary society as <span class="persName-WTB">William Beckford</span> (ca. <span class="date-1760-1844">1760–1844</span>) as well as
                    with minor, but influential literary men of the day, such as the editor <span class="persName-WJ">William
                    Jerdan</span> (ca. <span class="date-1782-1869">1782–1869</span>) and the author and clergyman <span class="persName-GCREV">George Croly</span>
                    (ca. <span class="date-1780-1860">1780–1860</span>). <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>ʼs piquant recollections of famous
                    writersʼ appearance, haunts, and conversation suggest a man of humor
                    and observation, and a frequenter of convivial and benevolent institutions such
                    as the Literary Fund Club. <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>, then, was a respectable City man with
                    literary and artistic connections, who would have appealed to <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>,
                    and who importantly could introduce the Ruskins to the fringes of the early
                    Victorian literary world.</div>
            
            <div class="p">According to his reminiscences, <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> traced his first encounter with a famous
                    author to hearing <span class="persName-STC">S. T. Coleridge</span> (ca.<span class="date-1772-1834">1772–1834</span>), in lectures that can
                    be dated , when <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> would have been  years old.
                    “He was giving a series of lectures on the Belles
                    Lettres in a large room on the first floor of a sixthߚrate tavern at

                    “a very young man” to dine at his house with artists
                    such as <span class="persName-DRP">David Roberts</span> (<span class="date-1796-1864">1796–1864</span>) (<span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>, “Notes and

            <div class="p"> <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> knew <span class="persName-DRP">Roberts</span> from their common association with
                    <i> <span class="title-book-JENNINGSLANDSCAPE">Jennings Landscape Annual</span> </i>, but they did not collaborate on
                    <span class="persName-DRP">Roberts</span>ʼs important work for that publication based on his Spanish
                    excursion of <span class="date-1832-1833">1832–33</span>. The letterpress for those volumes of
                    – was written by <span class="persName-TRT">Thomas Roscoe</span> (ca. <span class="date-1791-1871">1791–1871</span>).
                    Instead, for the volume of <span class="date-1839">1839</span>, <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> collaborated with the artist <span class="persName-JHP">James
                    Holland</span> (ca. <span class="date-1799-1870">1799–1870</span>) on depictions of <span class="placeName-PORTUGAL">Portugal</span>, the logical
                    followߚup on the successful Spanish volumes (see
                    Saglia, “Imag(in)ing Iberia”). Surely it is no accident
                    that <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>ʼs writing about <span class="placeName-PORTUGAL">Portugal</span> for this important landscape
                    annual fell so close in time to his first introduction to his <span class="placeName-CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</span>
                    neighbors, the partner in a firm importing sherry from the vineyards of <span class="persName-PD">Pedro
                    Domecq</span> .</div>
            
            <div class="p">Subsequently, <span class="placeName-PORTUGAL">Portugal</span> became something of a specialty of <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>ʼs,
                    supplying the setting for other tales and poems in the annuals, such as .
                    <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> is selfߚconsciously a writer of “light
                    literature,” however, and, for him,
                    a “specialty” necessarily reflected a cultural
                    phenomenon—in this case, the appeal of the <span class="placeName-IBERIA">Iberian peninsula</span> to the
                    late Romantic and early Victorian imagination, owing to <span class="placeName-SPAIN">Spain</span>ʼs
                    occupation and looting by <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span> and subsequent liberation, along with
                    subsequent visits by <span class="persName-DRP">Roberts</span> and <span class="persName-DWC">David Wilkie</span>  figuring in prominence of .
                    It is not known that <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> ever visited this country— <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>
                    intimates that his old friend had never left <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span> (<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>,
                    <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span> )—and it seems likely that <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> worked in the
                    fashion of many writers for the ephemeral travel literature of the day, culling
                    and synthesizing information available in the vast outpouring of volumes
                    published by travelers to exotic places. This approach is significant as it
                    provides some basis for speculating about the manner of conversation between
                    <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> and <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, who did possibly travel to <span class="placeName-PORTUGAL">Portugal</span> prior to his
                    marriage , and who was a partner with the Portuguese vintner <span class="persName-PD">Pedro Domecq</span> .</div>
            
            <div class="p">The reticence of <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>, “Notes and Reminiscences,” in
                    which he mentions the Ruskins only in passing, perhaps played a part in
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs crafting of the much more delicately balanced
                    rhetoric—poised between nostalgic admiration and critical
                    satire—of his introduction to these sketches, “My First
                    Editor: An Autobiographical Reminiscence” (<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <i> <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Works</span> </i>,
                    34:93–104). For his part, <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> appears to have
                    deemed reflection on his friendship and professional relation with the Ruskins
                    as out of bounds for his “Reminiscences,” with the
                    possible exception of the section on <span class="placeName-OXFORD">Oxford</span>. That recollection reads like an
                    unused travel sketch for the annuals, recounted by the narrator of his other
                    tales and sketches—genial, ironic, given to rhetorical flourish. The
                    sketch concludes by opening a window only slightly on the relationship he
                    developed with the “Graduate of Oxford”: “As
                    in athletics, so in intellectual contests, life is often the price of the prize.
                    Here is a poem from the pen of an undergraduate, who has since achieved a
                    worldߚwide fame. It was published without the name of the author, and I
                    dare not add it”—and he quotes “Christ
                    Church, <span class="placeName-OXFORD">Oxford</span>” ([<span class="date-1878-08">August 1878</span>] p. 223). The mixture of anxiety and
                    nostalgia speaks worlds without giving much away.</div>
