               <div class="p">In a letter of 3 March 1823 to <span class="name--JJR">John James Ruskin</span>,
                   <span class="persName-MR"></span>Margaret Ruskin mentions receiving this publication 
                    (Ruskin Family Letters, ed. Burd, 121). Her remark does not make clear when the Ruskins'subscription began, 
                    but it might be significant that, with the 1823 issues, the magazine initiated volume 1 of a new series.</div>

                     <div class="p">The Evangelical Magazine was founded in 1793 as a nondenominational voice of evangelical culture 
                    embracing Anglican Evangelicalism, Old Dissent, and New Dissent (Altbolz, Religious Press in Britain, 45). 
                    That spirit of pan-evangelical catholicity of opinion and mission was reaffirmed at the start of the new series in 1823, 
                    but the position was being tested. A "Retrospect" published in the first issue of the new series admitted to the emergence of rival denominational publications 
                    on both the Anglican Evangelical and Congregational sides. In fact, the editorship of the <span class="title-">/</span> itself 
                    became dominated by Congregationalists, just as that sect prevailed within the organization that the magazine most prominently represented, 
                    the London Missionary Society (LMS)

                     <div> 
                        
                        <div class="p">So much of each issue was given over to news and formal reports of LMS activity that the Ruskins’ (or at least Margaret's) 
                    regular reading of the Evangelical Magazine implies a strong interest in missionary work. 
                    The reports included lists of charitable contributions to the LMS, which, as Sujit Sivasundaram argues, 
                    inspired readers with a collective experience of evangelical zeal. The lists comprised both large and small donations, 
                    even so modest as used copies of the Evangelical Magazine to be sent to missionaries abroad, 
                    who duly reported back with their gratitude for fresh reading to relieve the tedium of their missions. 
                    Readers therefore felt they played a part in a worldwide evangelistic effort 
                    (“The Periodical as Barometer,” 43-48).</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">Such outreach was characteristic of the LMSʼs larger effort in print culture, 
                    which <span class="persName-AJOHNSTON">Anna Johnston</span> describes as the construction of “a reading audience through its canny manipulation 
                    of textual and media technologies, a readership that would unite religious Britons in a common cause 
                    despite differences of class, region, gender, and age” (, 30). 
                    The young <span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span> was captured by the excitement, as evidenced by , 
                    which appears to record a speech or sermon at a meeting of a missionary society. 
                   <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was also vulnerable to the appeal of missionary celebrity, as shown by his starstruck enthusiasm 
                    for the poetry and journals of <span class="persName-RHBC">Reginald Heber, Bishop of</span><span class="placeName-Calcutta">Calcutta</span>.</div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="p">Besides reporting on the missionary activities of the LMS, <span class="title-">EVANGELICALMAG</span>the <i>Evangelical Magazine</i> addressed other interests that probably engaged the Ruskin family. 
                    Each issue contained a section of poetry, albeit strictly pious in subject matter; and the January issue routinely 
                    printed poems for the New Year, which may have influenced Ruskinʼs custom of composing a <a href="/" target="_self">New Yearʼs ode</a> to be fair‐copied 
                    and presented to his father on New Yearʼ;s Eve. Feature articles mainly concerned religious topics but 
                    occasionally encompassed other areas of knowledge, such as natural history. 
                    A section of book reviews and brief notices of religious publications, including pious works for children, 
                    evidently informed the elder Ruskinsʼs choice of some books for John, since some notices correspond to books 
                    that he is known to have owned (see, e.g., -->. Among the most prominent features in each issue 
                    were lengthy obituaries and biographies of celebrated clergy, embellished by an engraved portrait of a clergyman, 
                    which supplied the sole graphic interest in each issue, apart from the engraved banner. 
                    These biographies exposed the reader to peoples, landscapes, and customs of cultures around the world, 
                    albeit filtered through the perception of missionaries.</div>
