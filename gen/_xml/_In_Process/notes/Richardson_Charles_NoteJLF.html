            <div class="p">Cousin of <span class="persName-">John Ruskin</span>, a son of <span class="persName-">Margaret</span> <span class="persName-">Ruskinʼs sister, Bridget</span>, and her husband <span class="persName-">George Richardson</span>, a baker. 
                    The Richardsons lived in the suburb of <span class="placeName-CROYDON">Croydon</span>, near the <span class="placeName-">Kingʼs Head</span>, the tavern operated by Margaret and <span class="persName-">Bridget</span>ʼs mother, <span class="persName-"> Margaret Cock</span>, and the sistersʼ birthplace. 
                    <span class="persName-">Margaret</span> took <span class="persName-">John</span> from a very young age to visit his <span class="placeName-">Croydon</span> cousins, though he was distanced from the family, being kept on walks or in his room, 
                    except for visits by <span class="persName-">Charles</span> and his sister <span class="persName-">Mary</span> (Margaret to John James Ruskin, 30 January 1822, in <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span>, 108).</a></div>
            
            <div class="p">By <span class="date-1829-10">October 1829</span>, <span class="persName-">Charles</span> was employed by the publisher, Smith, Elder, for at this time he presented <span class="persName-">John</span> with a copy of 
                    <a href="/notes/friendships_offering_note" target="_self"><span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span></a>, 
                    the “Literary Album and Annual Remembrancer” that the firm had recently taken over from its initial publisher. The editor was 
                    <a href="/notes/pringle_thomas_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-">Thomas Pringle </span>(<span class="date-1789-1834">1789–1834</span>)</a>, who was possibly introduced to the Ruskin family through the Smith, Elder connection. 
                    According to <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, <span class="persName-">Charles</span> decided to emigrate to <span class="placeName-">Australia</span> to join his brother, ???, 
                    because advancement at the publishing firm was unlikely. <span class="persName-">Charles</span> was drowned while the ship remained anchored off <span class="placeName-">Cowes</span> in <span class="date-1834-01">January 1834</span> 
                    (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 35: 135-37). 
                    One wonders whether <span class="persName-">Pringle</span>—whose experience had been mixed as an immigrant to <span class="placeName-">South Africa</span>, and who coincidentally died later in the same year—had encouraged the move.</div>
