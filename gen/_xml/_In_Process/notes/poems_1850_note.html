                  <div class="p">In <span class="date-1847-03">March 1847</span>, when <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> wrote to his friend, <a href="/notes/harrison_w_h_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-WHH">W. H. Harrison</span> (ca. <span class="date-1792-1878">1792–1878</span>)</a>, 
                        to affirm his intention to have a collection of his sonʼs poems printed, he referred to having “had for a very long time a Volume of yours containing some light pieces of my son”. 
                        In other words, before the <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1850"><i>Poems</i> (<span class="date-1850">1850</span>)</span> was realized, the family and friends 
                        produced and made use of compilations of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poems (<span class="title-letter-jjr_to_whh_1847-03-08"><span class="placeName-LEEDS">Leeds</span>, <span class="date-1847-03-08">8 March 1847</span></span>, in

                        The “volume” mentioned in this letter probably refers to a present from <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> for the holiday season of <span class="date-1844-12-25">Christmas 1844</span> and <span class="date-1845-01-01">New Yearʼs 1845</span>.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">On <span class="date-1845-01-04">4 January 1845</span>, while spending a disagreeably unseasonal holiday at the seaside with his family in <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> thanked <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> for the “trouble you have taken to get me a Set of 
                        <span class="persName-pen_name-JR">JR</span>. <span class="title-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING">F.O</span> contributions”, 
                        referring to <span class="persName-JR">John</span> by the pen name he used for most of his contributions to annuals 
                        (<span class="title-letter-jjr_to_whh_1845-01-04">letter</span>, in <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFMSL5" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-RFMSL5"><span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> to <span class="persName-WHH">W.

                        The current location of this volume, if extant, is unknown, so its contents cannot now be determined. If limited, as <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> indicates, to contributions to 
                        <a href="/notes/friendships_offering_note" target="_self"><span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span></a>, 
                        the choice was logical as a gift from the former editor (<span class="date-1836-1841">1836–41</span>) of that annual—and an editor 
                        who had grown particularly close to the Ruskin family during that tenure. Given the history of his relationship with the Ruskins, it seems no coincidence that the holiday season 
                        of <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>ʼs gift also marked the end of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs regular appearances in the holiday gift annual that had brought them together, 
                        <span class="title-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span>. After having contributed annually to the volumes for <span class="date-1835-1844">1835 through 1844</span>, 
                        in <span class="date-1845-01-01">New Yearʼs 1845</span> <span class="persName-pen_name-JR">J.R.</span> apppeared instead in two annuals edited by <span class="persName-MGBLESSINGTON">Lady Blessington</span> for Longmans

                  <div class="p">Possibly the “set” of poems described by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> in this letter was the same item as the collection of “proofs of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs contributions

          <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>“bound up” for <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> to carry “on his tours“

                        with this statement, any more than with the “volume” in <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs letter. If the same object, one can speculate that the volume would have been bound in a size convenient for transport, 
                        and it was also intended for ease of reference. As <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> commented later in the year to <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>, 
                        he was often frustrated by “the Scatterment” of his sonʼs poems published in annuals over several years; it was “the Looking for the needle in the Bundle of Hay 
                        I dislike—I know not how to have him or where to find him”

          was the bound holograph manuscript, <a href="/apparatuses/edmond_ms_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-EDMONDMS">“<span class="persName-JR">J. Ruskin </span>| Poems” (n.d.), or “Edmond manuscript”</span></a>. 
                        This consists of transcriptions, in an unidentified hand, of poems by <span class="persName-pen_name-JR">J.R.</span> published in <span class="title-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span>. 
                        As a holograph manuscript, it does not answer to the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>ʼs description of <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>ʼs 
          bound proofs. Another possible indication of a provenance disconnected from <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> is the omission of certain transcriptions—for example, the poem 
          <a href="/apparatuses/remembrance_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRREMEMBRANCE">“Remembrance”</span></a>, 
          which is not signed “<span class="persName-pen_name-JR">J.R.</span>” in <span class="title-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING">Friendshipʼs Offering</span>, but which <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> would have known to be <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs; and of poems that were published in another publication edited by <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> 
                        in <span class="date-1839">1839</span>, the <span class="title-periodical-LONDONMONTHLYMISC"><i>London Monthly Miscellany</i></span> 
                        (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#JRWORKSLE" target="_self"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 38:5).</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="p">While the hand responsible for the <span class="title-manuscript-EDMONDMS">“Edmond manuscript”</span> has not been identified, the physical item does make a good fit 
                        with circumstances mentioned by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> in his <span class="title-letter-jjr_to_whh_1847-03-08"><span class="date-1847-03-08">8 March 1847</span> letter</span> quoted above, in which 
                        <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> declares his intention to have <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poems printed. After thanking <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> for his “volume”, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> goes on: “I have delayed having them [<span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs “verses”] penned because I want to get the best 
                        of all he has ever penned selected & printed in good Type”. The <i>penning</i> clearly refers to a copyistʼs work at the behest of <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, preliminary to publication. 
                        In <span class="date-1845">1845</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> followed a similar procedure in having <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs letters from <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> copied, preparatory to publishing them as an epistolary travel narrative. As <span class="persName-HIS">Harold Shapiro</span> 
                        explains in his edition of the letters, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> “carefully preserved them, of course, and put them in order. More than that, the originals are full of his markings. He numbered them, 
                        supplied missing dates and places in the headings, made notations on them for a copyist, underlined the passages to be copied, cancelled details to be omitted, and even inserted a word 
                        here and there” (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RUSKININITALY" target="_self"><span class="persName-HIS">Shapiro</span>, introduction to <span class="title-book-"><i>Ruskin in Italy</i></span></a>, xx). 
                        While no such editorial markings by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> are evident in the <span class="title-manuscript-EDMONDMS">“Edmond manuscript”</span>, its very exacting transcriptions 
                        might represent a stage in the evolving plans toward a printed volume; and while the existence of this manuscript seems to conflict with <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs statement that he had “delayed” 
                        transcription of <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs poems, the manuscript may have been rejected as a false start, given <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs requirements in <span class="date-1847">1847</span>. As explained in the 
                        <a href="/apparatuses/edmond_ms_apparatus#DESCRIPTION" target="_self">description</a> of the manuscript, the transcriptions are not “selected”, 
                        as <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> now wanted—starting, as they do, with <a href="/apparatuses/#SALTZBURG_apparatus" target="_self">
                     <span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">“Saltzburg”</span></a>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs first poem published in 
                        <span class="title-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span>, 
                        which was not ultimately chosen for inclusion in the <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1850">Poems (<span class="date-1850">1850</span>)</span>—and the sequence of transcriptions is faulty, foundering on a mistake in transcription of the poems for 
                        <span class="date-1842">1842</span>. Nonetheless, regardless of whether this manuscript is related directly to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs project of printing the <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1850">Poems</span> in <span class="date-1850">1850</span>, 
                        the manuscript attests at the very least to the interest <span class="date">before 1850</span> in collecting <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs poems scattered throughout published annuals.</div>

                  <div class="p">In <span class="date-1845">1845</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs need “to have these trifles [of poems] more comeatable—less scattered” came to seem more pressing 
                    as four new poems by <span class="persName-JR">John</span> were sent to <span class="persName-MGBLESSINGTON">Lady Blessington</span>, 
                    who divided them between two annuals under her editorship, <a href="/notes/bibliography#KEEPSAKE1846" target="_self"><span class="title-annual-KEEPSAKE1846"><i>The Keepsake, 1846</i></span></a> and

                    she had done with three poems by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in the previous year. “You know we centred all in <span class="title-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING">F. O.</span>”, 
                    <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> reminded <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>, referring to the long run of poems by <span class="persName-pen_name-JR">J.R.</span> 
                    published in the Smith, Elder annual. <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> pointed out that it would be “no joke” 
                    having now to present two annuals as holiday remembrances to people connected with the family—and those two publications no less than the grand and expensive annuals superintended for 
                    Longmans by the daring entrepreneur, <span class="persName-CTH">Charles Heath</span> (<span class="date-1785-1848">1785–1848</span>), 
                    as compared with the familiar and less imposing annual produced by the Ruskinsʼ friends at Smith, Elder

                  <div class="p">A more worrying prospect to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> than the expense of holiday gifts, however, and a more emotional cause for collecting the poems for publication 
                        in <span class="date-1850">1850</span>, was the wrenching fact that the poems were becoming less important to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself. Already, <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>ʼs 
                        gift of the <span class="date-1845">1845</span> collection had apparently prompted some affectation of indifference by <span class="persName-JR">John</span>, his father reporting that “some in this House had no recollection 
                        of having before seen” certain poems, although considerably connected with the Author”

                    Now, when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> departed for <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> in <span class="date-1845-04">April 1845</span>, 
                        his first Continental tour without his parentsʼ direct supervision, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> grew more outspoken about losing interest in verse composition. 
                        Although continuing to oblige his father by sending home new poems for publication, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> paraded his indifference and even contempt: 
                        “Of course do all that you like with poems. <span class="persName-MGBLESSINGTON">Lady B[lessington]</span> just as good as any one. I have neither pride nor pleasure in them”. 
                        On his fatherʼs birthday, he wrote less flippantly, but more decisively, explaining that his poetical impulse was dulled by a critical temper, which he regarded as superior: 
                    “I almost always see two sides of a thing at once, now—in matters poetical—& I never get strongly excited without perceiving drawbacks & imperfections 
                    which somehow one lost sight of when one was younger”

                        After temporizing with the hope that it was only “at present” that <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs “poetry . . . has got among [his] prose”, 
                        and admitting to <span class="persName-JR">John</span> that it may have been “cruel in me to ask you to write for me—you should never write Poetry but when you cannot help it”—by 
                        the following year, in <span class="date-1846">1846</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> was ready to “put an end to doubt as to annuals” and confirm to <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> 
                        that “my <span class="persName-JR">Son</span> seems disposed to shake hands & part from” such publications altogether. By <span class="date-1847">1847</span>, therefore, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> 
                        was resolved that the time had arrived to collect the poems formally as “a family Record” for private distribution

                        emphatic that the collection would not be comprehensive but “selected &, representative of “the best of all [<span class="persName-JR">John</span>] has ever penned” in verse. 
                        Besides the focus on <span class="title-anthology-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendshipʼs Offering</i></span> poems—which 
                        do predominate in <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1850"><i>Poems</i> by J.R. (1850)</span>, albeit not exclusively—another 
                        decision weighing against inclusion of <span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER">“On Skiddaw and Derwent Water”</span> 
                        was a preference for more mature poetry. At first, in an <span class="date-1850">1850</span> letter to his son, who was working in <span class="placeName-VENICE">Venice</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> proposed opening the volume with some poems composed at age twelve, which were family favorites; and he pressed his son to decide also if he wanted 
                        “any few lines in the under 10 Little Book to put in.” By a “Little Book”, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> must refer to one of 
                        the <a href="/notes/red_book_note" target="_self">Red Books</a> composed prior to age ten. 
                        Then on the next day (<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs birthday), before <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> could have replied to this previous letter, 
                        his father all but overruled the inclusion of early juvenilia, informing his son that “[w]e shall not print your 12 year [i.e., age twelve] poems which tho marvellous are better 
                        in your own <u>printed</u> written [i.e., hand‐lettered] little Book—We shall begin with [the poem] <span class="title-poem-JRMONTHS">Months</span> age 16
