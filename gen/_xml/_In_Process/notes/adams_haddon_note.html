               <div class="p"><span class="persName-HA">Haddon C. Adams</span> made an important bequest to the Ruskin Galleries, <span class="placeName-BEMBRIDGE">Bembridge</span>,
                    which came to the Galleries on <span class="date-1971-09-15">15 September 1971</span>, following <span class="persName-HA">Adams</span>ʼs
                    death on <span class="date-1971-06-14">14 June 1971</span> (although he had deposited some items, including diaries
                    of <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, prior to his death). <span class="persName-HA">Adams</span>, a civil engineer and a friend
                    of <span class="persName-JHW">John Howard Whitehouse</span>, started collecting during a visit to <span class="placeName-">Brantwood</span> in
                    <span class="date-1928-06">June 1928</span>. Early work forming part of the <span class="persName-HA">Adams</span> bequest included the commonplace
                    book, MS ; <i>Little Jack</i>, with its
                    tracings; and drawings of <span class="date-1831">1831</span> (a tower, signed with initials and dated <span class="date-1831-01-09">1 September
                    1831</span>), <span class="date-1832">1832</span> (“Tunbridge Castle” [<span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span> 38:
                    288, no. 1698]), <span class="date-1835">1835 </span>(twelve drawings from the tour of that year), and undated
                    but possibly early copies of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>. Work by <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> associated with
                    his sonʼs youth included his diary for <span class="date-1833">1833</span>, and the drawing “<span class="placeName-building-">Conway
                    Castle</span>.” </div>
