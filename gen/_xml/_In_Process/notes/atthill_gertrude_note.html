            <div class="p">As granddaughter of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs cousin, <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span>, <span class="persName-MGPBA">Atthill</span> both
                    inherited and purchased a collection related to Ruskin family history. Items
                    from the early years included <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span>ʼs diaries of <span class="date-1833">1833</span> and
                    <span class="date-1840-1841">1840–41</span> (now at the Huntington Library ), and one of her sketchbooks
                    (now at <span class="placeName-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span>); and the portraits of <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>, by <span class="persName-JNORTHCOTE">James Northcote</span>,
                    and of <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, by  Watson (both now at <span class="placeName-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span>). <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span>
                    speculated that all the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drawings listed in the <i>Catalogue of Drawings</i> (<span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span> 38:) as owned by
                    <span class="persName-JJBOLDING">J. J. Bolding</span> (<span class="persName-MGPBA">Atthill</span>ʼs father) belonged to her, as well, but these
                    had disappeared (see <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span>, “Mrs Gertrude Atthill”).</div>
