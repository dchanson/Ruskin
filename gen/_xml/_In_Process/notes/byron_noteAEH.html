            <div class="p">In <span class="date-1834-01">January 1834</span>, when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="persName-JJR">father</span> wrote in reply to 
                    <a href="/" target="_self"><span class="persName-JH">James Hogg</span> (ca. <span class="date-1770-1835">1770–1835</span>)</a>, 
                    who had asked for an account of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs progress in using his wonderful abilities, <span class="persName-">John James</span> included a sample of <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs rhymes, possibly taken from 
                    <a href="/" target="_self">Account of a Tour on the Continent</a>, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was composing at that time. 
                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>ʼs critique of the lines, which is known only from <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span>ʼs reply to <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>, dwelled on the boyʼs imitation of <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span> and <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>, 
                    presumably intending to encourage greater originality. 
                    <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span>ʼs comment identifies the boyʼs sense of how these two poets related to one another: 
                    “I have read <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span> with wonder, and <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span> with delight, they have caused me many a day-dream and night-dream”
