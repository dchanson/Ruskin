(see <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>ʼs discussion of this 261). <span class="persName-">Runciman</span> was employed initially to teach <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span>ʼs cousin, <span class="persName-">Mary Richardson</span>. . . .</div>

                    <span class="persName-">Runciman</span> is assigned the specialty of a historical painter, and he is credited with 57 exhibitions between <span class="date-1825-1867">1825 and 1867</span>, of which 16 were at the Royal Academy,
                    25 at the  British Institution, and 16 at the Suffolk Street Exhibitions (i.e., the Society of British Artists) (p. 203). [check ref works in <span class="persName-KDH">Harris</span>]. <span class="persName-PHW">Walton</span> 
                    says that <span class="persName-">Runciman</span> “tried unsuccessfully for years to attract favourable attention as a painter of landscapes, genre scenes, and historical subjects” (9).</div>
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-">Runciman</span>ʼs metier was teaching of perspective (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 261 n. 13), reflected in <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span>ʼs description of a lesson: “I took my paper & I fixed my points, 
                    & I drew my perspective, & then as Mr <span class="persName-">Runciman</span> bid me, I began to invent a scene”. 
                    Working within this method, <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span> constructed a scene by means of what he termed “patch[ing] . . . together”: “I examined one of <span class="persName-">Mary</span>ʼs pictures, 
                    to see how the rocks were done, & then another to see how the woods were done, & another to see how the moutains were done, 
                    and another to see how the cottages were done, and I patched them all together, & I made such a lovely scene” (<a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1832-02-20_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter of <span class="date-1832-02-20">20 February 1832</span></span></a> [<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 262–63]). 
                    Although <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span> expected to be scolded for this patchwork approach to invention, but the masterʼs response was that ‘patch[ing] up . . . was not copying’”, 
                    and that “there was something in” <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span>ʼs picture “that would make him totally change the method he had hitherto pursued with me”. Forthwith, <span class="persName-">Runciman</span> 
                    instructed <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> to use watercolor on grey paper, beginning “with a few of the simplest colours, in order to teach me better the effects of light & shade”. 
                    The aim was “to teach me water colour painting, but . . . only as a basis for oil” (<a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1832-02-27_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter of <span class="date-1832-02-27">27 February 1832</span></span></a> [<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 267].</div>
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-">Paul H. Walton</span> speculates this change in approach signifies that <span class="persName-">Runciman</span> “believed that he had encountered a boy who would one day bring lustre to his teacherʼs name through his success as a professional 
                    artist in the exhibitions of the Royal Academy”, but that such ambitions were foiled by the elder <span class="persName-">Ruskins</span>ʼ plans of a more gentlemanly profession for their son, 
                    for which “advanced training in the techniques and materials of art” such as oils “would introduce an unnecessary and inappropriate degree of specialization” (9. 11). 
                    In due course, as <span class="persName-">Walton</span> points out, <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span> came to dislike oil painting, complaining in an <span class="date-1835">1835</span> rhymed letter to his father of its smell and messiness. Instead, 
                    “<span class="persName-">C. Fielding</span>s tints alone for me”, <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span> declared, having begun his lessons with <span class="persName-">Copley Fielding</span> in this year, the same year in which he appears to have ended 
                    his instruction with <span class="persName-">Runciman</span> (<a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1835-03-11_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter of <span class="date-1835-03-11">11 March 1835</span></span></a> [<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 312, and see 261 n. 13, 314 n. 3]). If snobbery about an ungentlemanly dirtying 
                    of oneʼs hands was a factor in <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span>ʼs rejection of <span class="persName-">Runciman</span>ʼs course of instruction, 
                    so was the time involved in “some fifty coats to be / Splashed on each spot successively” (<a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1835-03-11_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter of <span class="date-1835-03-11">11 March 1835</span></span></a> [<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 312]). From the start, however, even when <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span> was still 
                    “patching together” his pictures, the quality that perhaps gained <span class="persName-">Runciman</span>ʼs attention was a <span class="persName-">Wordsworthian</span> combining of memory and spontaneity. When constructing 
                    his first scene for <span class="persName-">Runciman</span>, <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span> was not entirely copying, because he “thought . . . [his] model resembled” his memory of “the cottage that we saw, 
                    as we went to <span class="geogName-RHAEADRDDU">Rhaidyr Dhu</span>, near <span class="placeName-MAENTRWOG">Maentwrog</span> where the old woman lived whose grandson went with us to the fall, so very silently” (<a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1832-02-20_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter of <span class="date-1832-02-20">20 February 1832</span></span></a> [<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 262]); and the 
                    painting that he had in prospect to learn from <span class="persName-">Runciman</span> seemed to <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span> a “superior” art, because he would be able to “carry off <span class="geogName-">Derwent Water</span> & <span class="geogName-">Skiddaw</span>
                    in my pocket” (<a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1832-02-27_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter of <span class="date-1832-02-27">27 February 1832</span></span></a> [<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 268]). When graduating to <span class="persName-">Fielding</span>ʼs instruction, <span class="persName-">Ruskin</span> was still looking to capture the ephemeral, “To sketch the scenes that pass me by” in 
                    the “lovely world” of “the heavens high” that remind him of other places, such as an illusory “heap of Alpine snow” over the <span class="geogName-">Norwood hills</span> (<a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1835-03-11_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">letter of <span class="date-1835-03-11">11 March 1835</span></span></a> [<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 311, 310]).</div>
