               <div class="p">The term is applied also to some works that do belong to a related, conventional
                    genre, such as the topographical poem, in order to signal that the work refers
                    or may refer to an actual journeyâ€”thus distinguishing the work from
                    others based on journeys drawn from the imagination or literary inspiration. Of
                    course, it may be difficult to tell apart the record of an actual journey from
                    an imagined one, just as literary journeying doubtless influenced what and how
                    the Ruskins beheld actual landscapes. The term is used conservatively,
                    indicating that a case can be made connecting a work being directly to a
                    specific journey; and the modifier <i>possible</i> is added only
                    when the occurrence of the journey itself is uncertain. The term <i>possible travel document</i> is not extended to descriptive
                    works that, for example, may happen to contain a memory of a place the Ruskins
                    visited: in those cases, the Discussion section of the apparatus will point the
                    reader toward the distant associations.</div>
