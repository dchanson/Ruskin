                    from <span class="date-1871">1871</span>. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> first encountered <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span> in <span class="date-1854">1854</span> at the Working Menʼs College.
                    <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span> was pursuing art studies there to augment his developing reputation as a
                    skilled joiner and carpenter, and his abilities so sufficiently impressed <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>
                   that he was picked as an assistant drawing master.
                    His skill in engraving . <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span> became <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs personal
                    assistant in , turning down offers from <span class="persName-WM">William Morris</span> as a
                    founding member for furniture design in <span class="persName-WM">Morris</span>, <span class="persName-CM">Marshall</span>, <span class="persName-CFAULKNER">Faulkner</span> and Company, and
                     for care of furnishings in the Queenʼs household.</div>
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-GA">Allen</span>ʼs devotion to his “Master” (upheld
                    despite periodic strains caused by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs violent outbursts in
                    times of illness) combined well with his shrewd business sense to enable him to
                    realize <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs experiments in publishing and bookselling while
                    remaining profitable. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> aimed to bypass the complex system of discounts
                    that growing up between publishers and trade as a result of cheaper printing
                    methods, widening of the reading public (including demands
                    for “self‐culture” by the working classes), and
                    competing influences of the subscription libraries and booksellers. All this
                    encouraged dissemination of “cheap classics” without
                    regard, in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs paternalistic view, for felt sacrifice in
                    obtaining value both in content and the physical quality of a book, or for fair
                    royalties to authors supporting new writing (although later, by <span class="date-1882">1882</span>, <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span>
                    eased <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs resistance to inexpensive editions of his works).
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> proposed establishing the same consistent and open prices for trade and
                    public alike, providing fair return to both author and publisher (<span class="persName-GA">Allen</span> agreed
                    with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> for a third of profits, which continued after <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs
                    death) while exposing any additional price added by a middleman.</div>
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> laid out these principles in <i>Fors Clavigera</i>
                    ([1871–]; see, e.g., <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span> ),
                    inaugurating them with the monthly publication of those pamphlets as well as
                    with the Works Series. <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span> printed and distributed the pamphlets from his home
                    in <span class="placeName-KENT">Kent</span>, first at Heathfield Cottage, <span class="placeName-KESTON">Keston</span>, and then, from <span class="date-1874">1874</span> as the
                    business grew, at <span class="placeName-building-SUNNYSIDE">Sunnyside</span>, <span class="placeName-ORPINGTON">Orpington</span>—the familiar imprint for
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs part‐publications throughout the <span class="date-1870-1879">1870s</span> and <span class="date-1880-1889">1880s</span>.
                    At first, the pastoral village setting, while charming to both 
                  <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span> and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs sense of the place of
                    handcraftsmanship in English life, caused practical difficulties that the
                    cosmopolitan London book trade was swift to ridicule. But </div>
               
               <div class="p">Through contentious negotiations with <span class="persName-GS">Smith</span> and <span class="persName-AE">Elder</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs

                    for <i>Fors</i>), <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> finally obtained in  copyright of
                    his earlier works and, in <span class="date-1878">1878</span>, purchase of engraved plates. For <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, the
                    relations with <span class="persName-GS">Smith</span> and <span class="persName-AE">Elder</span> were painfully bound up with relations with his
                    father, who until his death had managed his sonʼs publishing
                    affairs. Despite bitter emotions that colored the negotiations, the decision to
                    transfer all his titles to <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span> proved sound.</div>
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-GA">Allen</span>ʼs alertness to the market assured that steady sales of

                    <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span> frequently complained about . His early skill in engraving drew him to
                    producing fine editions, although he was keenly conscious the full spectrum of
                    the market for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs works. Attention to both ends of the market
                    decided the dual format of works important to the publication history of
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs juvenile work, which <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span> exploited in order to expand his
                    list while operating under the unusual condition of serving, at first, as a
                    single‐author publisher. <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i></span> (<span class="date-1891">1891</span>), <i>Three Letters and an Essay on Literature</i> (<span class="date-1893">1893</span>), <i>Letters to a College Friend</i> (<span class="date-1894">1894</span>), and <i>
                       Poetry of Architecture</i> () were all issued in both fine and cheap
                    editions. Before his death in <span class="date-1907">1907</span>, <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span> oversaw production and release of
                    several volumes of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> (<span class="date-1903-1912">1903–12</span>), the first two
                    volumes containing <i>Early Prose</i> (vol. 1 []) and <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Poems</i></span> (vol. 2 [<span class="date-1903">1903</span>]) and incorporating
                    <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span> and <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>ʼs earlier editions of early
                    works.</div>
               
               <div class="p">Fine editions were limited and printed on handmade paper .</div>

                    board. With <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> sales slowing, <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span> sought to expand his list with other
                    offers; however, after his death in <span class="date-1907">1907</span>, slow sales  of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>
                    and the inadequate list  apart from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> proved a drag on the business.
                    Efforts to expand occurred in <span class="date-1909">1909</span> with acquisition of the publishing branch of
                    Bemrose and Sons and, in <span class="date-1911">1911</span>, of Swan Sonnenschein & Company, creating

                    into receivership under <span class="persName-SUNWIN">Stanley Unwin</span> (), who formed George Allen &
                    Unwin in <span class="date-1914">1914</span>. That company continued for a while to issue remaining unbound
                    stock in the Uniform Edition, sometimes with George Allen & Unwin
                    imprinted on the spine, but high costs and uncertainties of the market in the
                    war years prevented new reprints of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>.</div>

                    reprints. By terms of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs will, <span class="persName-AW">Alexander Wedderburn</span>, one of
