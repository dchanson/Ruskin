               <div class="p">That <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> timed his purchase of <span class="persName-EDB">Butterworth</span> as an aid to <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs coming of age as a young scholar answers to <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs own submission 
                    of “his first written letter” to his father, as announced by <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> in the same <a href="/apparatuses/mr_to_jjr_1827-04-28_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-"><span class="date-1827-04-28">28 April 1827</span> letter</span></a> 
                    in which she mentions <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs delight “at being able to use pen & ink”. By “first written letter”, 
                    <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> may have meant, not just <span class="persName-JR">John</span>ʼs first letter using cursive in ink, 
                    but his first epistle written in his own hand independently of his mother and mailed to his father. 
                    What <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> called <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs “first letter” was written by <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> in her hand, 
                    taken by dictation from <span class="persName-JR">John</span> who “pretended to read from his paper” that “he said was a letter to send to you” 
                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 128; see <a href="/apparatuses/jr_and_mr_to_jjr_1823-03-15_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-jr_and_mr_to_jjr_1823-03-15">autograph letter, <span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span> and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> to <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, <span class="date-1823-03-15">15 March 1823</span></span></a>). 
                    Between <span class="date-1823-01-01-1827-12-31">that so‐called “first letter” in 1823 and what <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> dubs the “first written letter” in 1827</span>, 
                    <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a> contains no other letters independently <i>posted</i> 
                    by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> to his father, or any letters at all in a conventional sense. There is the <span class="date-1827-01-01">New Yearʼs 1827</span> presentation copy of 
                  <a href="/apparatuses/time_blank_verse_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-poem-JRTIMEBLANKVERSE">“Time: Blank Verse”</span> (<span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>)</a>, 
                    which mimics a letter in its fold and direction to the recipient, but which presumably <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> hand‐delivered to his father. 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrote this <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> document in pencil print, using lettering which suggests a printed book model rather than a handwriting copybook. 
                    For his “first written letter” (which <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> declares “unidentified”, but which can persuasively be identified as 
                    <a href="/apparatuses/jr_to_jjr_1827-05_al_apparatus" target="_self"><span class="title-letter-">autograph letter, <span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span> to <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, <span class="date-1827-05">May 1827</span></span></a>), 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrote the text of the letter in cursive, mostly in pencil except for a final sentence prior to the signature inserted in ink. 
                    Composed prior to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>ʼs acquisition of <span class="title-manual_guide-BUTTERWORTHYOUNGARITHMETICIAN"><i>Butterworthʼs Young Arithmeticianʼs Instructor</i></span> two months later, 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>ʼs cursive in this letter strongly resembles his <span class="persName-MR">mother</span>ʼs in the formation of the characters.</div>
