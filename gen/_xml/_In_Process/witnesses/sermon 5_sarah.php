            <span class="head-chapter" id="">The character of Abraham</span>
            
            <div class="p">1st verse XXIV.  And <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> was old
                    <br/>and well stricken, in years, and the <span class="persName-GOD">Lord</span> 
               <br/>had blessed <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> in all things.  I 
                    <br/>have read these verses, in order to make 
                    <br/>some observations on the history, char
                    <br/>acter, and religion of <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>, as an 
                    <br/>illustration of the faith and obedience, of 
                    <br/>which he sets us so striking an example.
                    <br/>Now I should premise that although we 
                    <br/>often consider religion, generally, as a cr
                    <br/>eed of outward institutions, and although 
                    <br/>it is fitting so to do, yet it is also ne
                    <br/>cessary, that we should consider it, as 
                    <br/>embodied in some of the principal
                    <br/>characters which are held forth, for our 
                    <br/>imitation, in the holy <span class="title-scripture-BIBLE">scripture</span>s.  For
                    <br/>religion, as drawn by the pen of in
                    <br/>spiration, is entirely perfect, both in 
                    <br/>its injunctions, and in its ordinan‐
                    <br/>ces, but as it appears in character, 
                    <br/>it is imperfect sometimes distorted, its 
                    <br/>injunctions are forgotten, and its ordi‐
                    <br/>nances are not observed, which is entire
                    <br/>ly caused by the imperfection of man, 
                    <br/>not of religion.  Yet, it will be profita
                    <br/>ble for us to observe how far, and how 
                    <br/>perfectly, religion can be embodied, in 
                    <br/>the character of any human creature 
                    <br/>and thus, and thus only we shall be a
                    <br/>ble to feel, and to lament the great‐
                    <br/>ness of our own coming short.  
                    <br/>Without therefore, yielding one title, of 
                    <br/>the influence, and perfect excellency of 
                    <br/>religion, we wish to see how far that 
                    <br/>influence extends itself, over the life,
                    <br/>the actions, and the character, of this 
                    <br/>great patriarch.  Now, the history of</div>
            <div id="296805v_0027" class="pb"></div>
            <br/>
            <div class="p"><span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>, is not that, of a young and 
                    <br/>inexperienced convert, it is not of the first 
                    <br/>enthusiasm, and budding of religion, but of
                    <br/>the steady and undeviating piety of an ag
                    <br/>ed, and venerable man, of one who has 
                    <br/>been much tried. and whose trials having
                    <br/>been passed through with glory, and with 
                    <br/>honour, have only caused him to come
                    <br/>forth like refined gold from the furnace 
                    <br/>he was old, and stricken in age, and the 
                    <br/><span class="persName-GOD">Lord</span> had blessed him in all things.</div>
            <br/>
            <div class="p">We shall now proceed to consider the var
                    <br/>ious points of the history of the patriarch
                    <br/>and the example, which they present us 
                    <br/>with.  The conduct of <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> through
                    <br/>out the whole of his life, is, in the first 
                    <br/>place, a most striking illustration of faith 
                    <br/>and this faith was realized in his every 
                    <br/>action. and indeed, in the very first action
                    <br/>of which any mention is made.  He was 
                    <br/>told to leave his house, his family, his coun
                    <br/>try, but for what compensation?  He is not
                    <br/>told where is his residence to be.  He is not 
                    <br/>told.  What is the use of the sacrifice.  He is 
                    <br/>not told.  The place in which he had been 
                    <br/>brought up, where his affections must have
                    <br/>been centred, and with which recollections
                    <br/>most dear to him must have associa‐
                    <br/>ted, must be left in order to go to an un
                    <br/>known land, of which nothing whatever
                    <br/>is told <span class="del-strikethrough">us</span> him.  Now, had <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>, in
                    <br/>stead of exercising faith required evidence 
                    <br/>farther evidence than the voice of <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, it is
                    <br/>possible, that on account of this hesitati
                    <br/>on, he might have been disinherited,  The 
                    <br/>only evidence which he had, or which he 
                    <br/>asked for, was, the certainty that <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>
               <br/>had spoken, and all, except this, was en
                    <br/>tirely unsatisfactory.  Oh, that we could
                    <br/>be contended to do thus, to believe the 
                    <br/>promises of <span class="title-scripture-BIBLE">Scripture</span>, without prying in
                    <br/>to the future and to receive the word of
                    <br/><span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, as sufficient testimony.  But, it
                    <br/>may be asked, if we receive the testimony 
                    <br/>of <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> in any other way than that, in 
                    <br/>which it was accepted by <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>, and
                    <br/>before I answer this question, I would,
                    <br/>observe how exceedingly different are the
                    <br/>circumstances in which we are placed, from
                    <br/>those in which we have found <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> 
               <br/>exercising his faith <span class="del-strikethrough">so</span> in such an unqual
                    <br/>ified, and unhesitating manner.  We have
                    <div id="296805v_0028" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>seen these promises fulfilled, which had only
                    <br/>been made to <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>, we have seen the
                    <br/>birth of that <span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">redeemer</span>, on whom it was 
                    <br/>faith only which enabled <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> to be
                    <br/>lieve, and during a lengthened series of 
                    <br/>ages, we have seen the christian church
                    <br/>passing through <span class="del-strikethrough">?</span> severe and numberless 
                    <br/>trials and passing through them with vic
                    <br/>tory, and triumph, We stand on ground in
                    <br/>finitely superior to that on which <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>
               <br/>stood, and under these circumstances,— I
                    <br/>would answer, that I very much doubt, 
                    <br/>if we atall accept the word, in the man
                    <br/>ner in which it was accepted by <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>,
                    <br/>If the word of <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> were, indeed, 
                    <br/>thus received, should we not be inclined to 
                    <br/>enquire more closely and  more constantly
                    <br/>into the <span class="title-scripture-BIBLE">Scripture</span>s, into that which is 
                    <br/>the very ground of our faith.  I think, that
                    <br/>if we did receive the word thus unqualifi
                    <br/>edly, without <span class="del">dis</span> endeavoring to under
                    <br/>stand those parts which the <span class="persName-GOD">Almighty</span>
               <br/>hath placed above our comprehension, there
                    <br/>would be more unity of action, and prac
                    <br/>tical effect, in the whole of the Christian 
                    <br/>system, I consider, that the petty, and in
                    <br/>dubitably occasioned by that spirit of <span class="del-strikethrough">u</span>
               <br/>unbelief, or at <span class="del-strikethrough">at</span> least of receiving the 
                    <br/><span class="title-scripture-BIBLE">bible</span> only with commutations and reser
                    <br/>vations, to bring down its inscrutable, 
                    <br/>mysteries to the levell of our feeble com
                    <br/>prehensions, instead of accepting the tes‐
                    <br/>timony at  once, of risking all when the 
                    <br/><span class="persName-GOD">Lord</span> hath spoken, and the <span class="persName-GOD">Almighty</span> hath 
                    <br/>commanded us.  It was no light thing
                    <br/>nor one that in any <span class="del-strikethrough">ther</span> other case would
                    <br/>have been entered upon without long & 
                    <br/>mature consideration, that <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> should 
                    <br/>leave his family and his friends, his home 
                    <br/>and his country to go into a strange, and 
                    <br/>unknown land, whose inhabitants, if it
                    <br/>had other inhabitants than the wild beasts 
                    <br/>of the field, knew nothing of the <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> whom
                    <br/>he worshipped and obeyed, It had been 
                    <br/>long, ere <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> in such a circumstance
                    <br/>as this, had followed the advice of the wi
                    <br/>sest or the holiest of mortals, and it had
                    <br/>then been after much doubt and deep de
                    <br/>liberation.  But when he heard the voice
                    <div id="296805v_0029" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>of the <span class="persName-GOD">Lord</span>, he complied at once, and his com
                    <br/>pliance was unhesitating and unqualified.
                    <br/>I should question the wisdom of man, if it
                    <br/>led me into trouble or perplexity, but if the
                    <br/>commands of the <span class="persName-GOD">Almighty</span> appeared to
                    <br/>bring me into either, yet I feel myself en
                    <br/>tirely safe, under his guidance, and am will
                    <br/>ing to sacrifice any thing, and every thing
                    <br/>if the <span class="persName-GOD">Lord</span> commands me so to do.</div>
            <br/>
            <div class="p">Again, <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> was promised by <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> 
               <br/>that he should have a son, and that in 
                    <br/>him should his seed be called, and thus, 
                    <br/>all the promises which <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> ever made
                    <br/>to <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>, that his should be made a 
                    <br/>great nation, that his name should be 
                    <br/>made great &, are entirely centred upon
                    <br/><span class="persName-ISAAC">Isaac</span>.  And yet, in apparent contra‐
                    <br/>diction to the whole of this, another com
                    <br/>mandment is given to <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>, to sac
                    <br/>rifice <span class="persName-ISAAC">Isaac</span>. to take away that life
                    <br/>on which the fulfilment of all the promis
                    <br/>es depended. and besides all this, it was,
                    <br/>apparently in contradiction to the for<span class="del-strikethrough">m</span>
               <br/>mer commands of <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>., for human sac
                    <br/>rifice had been expressly forbidden.  Now
                    <br/>under these circumstances and in our way 
                    <br/>of receiving the word of <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, these opp
                    <br/>posing points would have, very likely des

                    <br/>ed, and reasoned, & deliberated and hesita
                    <br/>ted and most likely rejected,  But, we 
                    <br/>see that <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> does not reason
                    <br/>atall upon the circumstance, he knows
                    <br/>not, and he does not endeavour to ascer
                    <br/>tain, how his expectations justly found
                    <br/>ed on the promises, were to be realized
                    <br/>but he knows that he is a creature with
                    <br/>his creator, and his motto which he kept 
                    <br/>continually in view was, Shall not the 
                    <br/>judge of all the earth do right, he does
                    <br/>not take upon him to reconcile opposing 
                    <br/>circumstances, he does not suffer his affec
                    <br/>tions, or aught else to interfere with his
                    <br/>obedience, and <span class="del-strikethrough">t</span> we find him about to
                    <br/>sacrifice <span class="persName-ISAAC">Isaac</span>.  But the trial of his
                    <br/>faith is sufficient. he is arrested by an
                    <br/>angel, and a ram, provided as a more ac
                    <br/>ceptable sacrifice to the <span class="persName-GOD">Almighty</span>, is 
                    <br/>offered up in the stead of <span class="persName-ISAAC">Isaac</span>.  But it
                    <br/>may again be objected, why was his faith 
                    <br/>thus tried, was it merely to increase that
                    <br/>faith, was it only to improve his charac
                    <br/>ter, Certainly not.  It was to afford
                    <div id="296805v_0030" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>a farther example and illustration, of faith
                    <br/>to the descendants of the patriarch, who was 
                    <br/>to be the father of the faithful.  Let us
                    <br/>now again direct the attention of those who
                    <br/>are wanting in faith to <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>. and ask

                    <br/>ceptation of the word of <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> is equally free,
                    <br/>and unlimited, with that of the patriarch
                    <br/>I should, next consider the circumstan
                    <br/>ces of the life of <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>, as a most re
                    <br/>markable illustration of the power of 
                    <br/>Prayer. 2, and 22 to 33 verse XVIII We here
                    <br/>find <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> and <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, in immediate 
                    <br/>and visible contact.  Three men appear
                    <br/>ed unto <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> in the plain of <span class="placeName-MAMRE">Mamre</span>
               <br/>, as he sat in his tent door in the heat 
                    <br/>of the day.  One of these was <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> him Se
                    <br/>self, the other two were angels, We may 
                    <br/>ask how <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> was present to <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>, & 
                    <br/>I would answer, in the same manner
                    <br/>as he appeared to <span class="persName-MOSES">Moses</span> in the fiery bush,
                    <br/>or to the Israelites, in the pillar of cloud 
                    <br/>That is, he chose some body, in this in
                    <br/>stance he appeared in the form of him 
                    <br/>whom he created in his own image, to in
                    <br/>dicate, or signify his especial presence; al
                    <br/>though this body, whether it were cloud
                    <br/>or fire, or flesh, could not, strictly speak
                    <br/>ing be called <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, Now, after the
                    <br/><span class="persName-GOD">Lord</span> had made himself known unto
                    <br/><span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> we find that he entered into
                    <br/>conversation with him, the creature was
                    <br/>thus placed in intimate communion with
                    <br/>the <span class="persName-GOD">Creator</span>, and I do not know anything
                    <br/>throughout the whole range of sacred
                    <br/>writings that is so strikingly illustra
                    <br/>tive of the power of prayer, as the result 
                    <br/>of this conversation.  We see <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>
               <br/>in perfect self possession, yet remember
                    <br/>ing that he is but dust and ashes, calm
                    <br/>ly offering up, in the spirit of benevolence
                    <br/>his prayers for <span class="placeName-SODOM">Sodom</span>, and presenting
                    <br/>his reasons to the <span class="persName-GOD">Almighty</span> for inter
                    <br/>rupting his purpose, & <span class="del-strikethrough">to</span> every one of these
                    <br/>supplications, we find to be answered in 
                    <br/>the affirmative.  Here then, we have 
                    <br/>an example of the feelings with which
                    <br/>we constantly and invariable should pray  
                    <br/>This prayer rests upon faith, and we may
                    <br/>be sure that prayers which are not
                    <br/>so grounded, will not be accepted.

               <br/>And, in our own case, if we can believe, the
                    <br/><span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Redeemer</span> has died, and has obtained for us
                    <br/>salvation, we may then with all boldness
                    <br/>appear before <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, yet with diffidence, know
                    <br/>ing our own depravity yet assured that our
                    <br/>prayers will be granted.  For <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> looks not
                    <br/>for certain forms of worship or for cer
                    <br/>tain turns of expression, but for the feeling
                    <br/>the faith, the love, the faith, which should,
                    <br/>instigate the prayer, the love, which sho

                    <br/>should animate the prayer, and be assur
                    <br/>ed, that the prayer of the patriarch, was
                    <br/>entirely in keeping with all these.  <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> 
               <br/>premises, that he is but dust and ashes,
                    <br/>here was his humility, he asked nothing
                    <br/>for himself, he entirely forgot his own 
                    <br/>case in his anxiety for the preservati

                    <br/><span class="placeName-SODOM">Sodom</span>, for he was not so anxious for
                    <br/>the safety of the few righteous men who
                    <br/>might exist in <span class="placeName-SODOM">Sodom</span>, as that their
                    <br/>presence might preserve the unrighteous 
                    <br/>from destruction, he reduces the sup

                    <br/>benevolence toward his fellow crea

                    <br/>from thee to do after this manner
                    <br/>to slay the righteous with the wicked
                    <br/>and that the righteous should be as

                    <br/>Shall not the judge of all the earth do 
                    <br/>right,?__ Here was his accordance in 
                    <br/>and certainty of, the divine justice, 
                    <br/>and being grounded and supported 
               <br/>this justice, his prayer was accepted.
                    <br/>In the 3rd, and last place, I would
                    <br/>wish to consider the circumstances,
                    <br/>attendant upon the life of <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>
               <br/>as an illustration of the <span class="del-strikethrough">pe</span> general.
                    <br/>weakness of human nature,.  Relig
                    <br/>ion, as we before observed, is perfect,
                    <br/>and spotless in itself, but we never
                    <br/>find it so in the history of man, be
                    <br/>cause the evil of his nature is constant
                    <br/>ly resisting the operation of religion
                    <div id="Ruskin_MA_3451_296806_Verso_1" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>Now had <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> been entirely per
                    <br/>fect, it might be said that we had 
                    <br/>found religion embodied purely em
                    <br/>bodied in his character, in contradic
                    <br/>tion to all other experience. But he was
                    <br/>not perfect, he deviated from the path
                    <br/>of religion in many circumstances and
                    <br/>those not unimportant ones, When he
                    <br/>went into <span class="placeName-EGYPT">Egypt</span>, he denied that 
                    <br/><span class="persName-SARAH">Sarah</span> was his wife in order to avoid
                    <br/>an imaginary injury, it might be said
                    <br/>he told the truth when he said she 
                    <br/>was his sister, but not the whole truth 
                    <br/><span class="del-strikethrough">and</span> the deception was as great as if 
                    <br/>it had been a positive falsehood, and 
                    <br/>the wickedness in him, was, therefore 
                    <br/>also equal.  When we consider, that
                    <br/>this was the same man who would un
                    <br/>hesitatingly have sacrificed his son at 
                    <br/>the command of <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, is it not a won
                    <br/>derful illustration of the words of st <span class="persName-STPAUL">Paul</span>
               <br/>“the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh 
                    <br/>is weak.  Now it may be asked, why 
                    <br/>the failings of <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> are told us,
                    <br/>and there are two reasons, First, it was
                    <br/>to bring evidence, of the truth of the nar
                    <br/>rative, For had <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> been held
                    <br/>up to us, as perfect religion embodied, 
                    <br/>as faultless, had the history of his faith
                    <br/>his love his justice, alone been given to
                    <br/>us, this handle would be at once have
                    <br/>been seized upon by infidelity, and the
                    <br/>accuracy of the whole narrative would 
                    <br/>have been questioned, if not its truth
                    <br/>as being in entire contradiction to the
                    <br/>maxims inculcated by the <span class="title-scripture-BIBLE">Scripture</span>s 
                    <br/>and confirmed by experience.  And sec
                    <br/>ondly, that the conduct of <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> 
               <br/>might be constantly held up to all
                    <br/>posterity, as an example, which not on
                    <br/>ly ought to imitated, but which
                    <br/>in some degree, might be so.  For
                    <br/>we again repeat, that if we had not
                    <br/>been informed of the failings of the
                    <br/>patriarch, and he had been held up
                    <br/>to us entirely perfect, we should have
                    <br/>affirmed that the model was beyond 
                    <br/>our imitation, and that either the man
                    <br/>who attained to such a high degree of
                    <br/>perfection. must have been gifted with
                    <br/>powers <span class="del-strikethrough">to</span> much superior to ours,—or 
                    <div id="Ruskin_MA_3451_296806_Recto2" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>else, must have been placed in totally 
                    <br/>different situations, and which were 
                    <br/>much more favourable.  Thus, hav
                    <br/>ing no hope of success, we should have
                    <br/>been deterred from making the ef
                    <br/>fort, and the whole benefit of the exam
                    <br/>ple presented to us by <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>, would 
                    <br/>have been entirely lost, But when we 
                    <br/>see how great the failings were, even 
                    <br/>of <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>, we can consider him, as 
                    <br/>going before us in a path, in which 
                    <br/>by the grace of <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, we may follow.
                    <br/>him, and as are, whom we are able 
                    <br/>to imitate, inasmuch as even he, was 
                    <br/>not perfect.  Still these failings, it 
                    <br/>must be remarked, were only inciden
                    <br/>tal, they were not of frequent occurr
                    <br/>ence, and his habit his general ha
                    <br/>bit, was to rise above them, And, al
                    <br/>though he was a man of like passions 
                    <br/>with ourselves, yet there may have. 
                    <br/>been other causes, which can also ac
                    <br/>count for his so utterly forgetting
                    <br/>himself.  There is, there can be, no 
                    <br/>doubt. that <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> had one, gen
                    <br/>eral rule, by which to guide himself
                    <br/>in all difficulties, this was, to ask. if 
                    <br/><span class="persName-GOD">God</span> had spoken, if so, <span class="del-strikethrough">to</span> instantly to 
                    <br/>obey, without even so much as reason
                    <br/>ing upon the subject, and it was 
                    <br/>only when he forgot himself, and 
                    <br/>deviated from this general rule, or line 
                    <br/>of conduct, that he was drawn into
                    <br/>into any failing like that which we
                    <br/>have been considering.  It is neither 
                    <br/>said that <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> was comman
                    <br/>ded to go into <span class="placeName-EGYPT">Egypt</span>. nor that he
                    <br/>asked <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> whether it were fitting so 
                    <br/>to do, No, we are told that he fear
                    <br/>ed for his flocks, and for his herds, be
                    <br/>cause of the famine that prevailed, 
                    <br/>through the land, it was entirely a 
                    <br/>selfish consideration, which induced him
                    <br/>to go down into <span class="placeName-EGYPT">Egypt</span>, and therefore, 
                    <br/>not being under the protection of <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>
               <br/>he was first encompassed by danger, & 
                    <br/>then induced to commit crime, in order, 
                    <br/>to escape.  We may learn from this, that
                    <br/>it is necessary constantly to adhere to our
                    <br/>fundamental principles, if we deviate from
                    <br/>those but a very little, we are gone

               <br/>There is another remarkable failing of 
                    <br/><span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>, which remains to be noticed
                    <br/>his taking <span class="persName-HAGAR">Hagar</span> to be his wife, It is true 
                    <br/>that <span class="persName-ISHMAEL">Ishmael</span>, the son of <span class="persName-HAGAR">Hagar</span> was under 
                    <br/>divine protection but it was not by him 
                    <br/>that the promises were to be fulfilled.  The
                    <br/><span class="persName-GOD">Lord</span> had expressly said, In <span class="persName-ISAAC">Isaac</span> shall 
                    <br/>thy seed be called, and it was not by
                    <br/>his command, that <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> took 
                    <br/><span class="persName-HAGAR">Hagar</span>. and the after circumstances as
                    <br/>might have been expected, ended evilly 
                    <br/><span class="persName-SARAH">Sarah</span> believed imperfectly, that is, she
                    <br/>believed that the promises would be ful
                    <br/>filled, but she could not trust the man
                    <br/>ner of it to the <span class="persName-GOD">Almighty</span>, and as this 
                    <br/>manner was above her comprehension
                    <br/>she endeavoured to fulfill<span class="del-strikethrough">ed</span>, them, in 
                    <br/>her own way, and it was the part of 
                    <br/><span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> to have resisted her.  But we
                    <br/>see, that here again he forgot himself 
                    <br/>and yielded, therefore, let us hencefor
