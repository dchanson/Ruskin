               <br/>Ye have seen, that I have talked with

                    <br/>thinks rightly of the character of the
                    <br/>law, and of the attributes of the <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>
               <br/>who gave it, must be aware, that,

                    <br/>are approaching a subject of the very
                    <br/>highest importance.  As erroneous
                    <br/>opinion has sometimes been enter‐
                    <br/>tained, that the <span class="title-scripture-GOSPEL">Gospel</span> requires no‐

                    <br/>it would at first appear, that the

                    <br/>much exalted by this view of the 
                    <br/>subject.  But, we may be sure, that 
                    <br/>all homage is rejected, which confin

            <div class="p">In the next place, let us see how far
                    <br/>this view of the immense impor‐
                    <br/>tance of the law, is supported by the
                    <br/>circumstances of its delivery, for much
                    <br/>useful information may always be 
                    <br/>gathered from a examination of 
                    <br/>particulars, which at the first glance,
                    <br/>appear but of little consequence.  The 
                    <br/>children of <span class="persName-ISRAEL">Israel</span>, a multitude whose 
                    <br/>number cannot be reckoned less, 
                    <br/>than three millions, had, it should
                    <br/>be remembered, but just escaped from
                    <br/>a humiliating state of slavery, cor
                    <br/>ruption, and Idolatry; They were 
                    <br/>shut out and separated from the 
                    <br/>whole world, by the desert ,and the 
                    <br/>sea, and in this solitude, they were 
                    <br/>left to commune visible with God 
                    <br/>and we find that <span class="persName-GOD">the Deity</span> did 
                    <br/>not come to dwell among his people 
                    <br/>until he had laid down the law, 
                    <br/>which was, to be their principle of
                    <div id="MS Sermon 002a" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>action, in a manner, which should
                    <br/>give importance both to the law its‐
                    <br/>elf, and to his servant <span class="persName-MOSES">Moses</span>. who 
                    <br/>was a mediator between <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> and the 
                    <br/>Israelites.  We find the <span class="persName-GOD">Lord</span> descen
                    <br/>ding upon <span class="geogName-SINAI">Mount Sinai</span>, in fire to deli
                    <br/>ver his commandments, to this 
               <br/>ing assembly, We are told that <span class="geogName-SINAI">Mont Sinai</span>
               <br/>was altogether on a smoke, and 
                    <br/>there were thunderings and lightenings
                    <br/>and the whole mount quaked greatly
                    <br/><span class="persName-MOSES">Moses</span> himself said that he ex
                    <br/>ceedingly feared, Nature was entire‐
                    <br/>ly overwhelmed by this wonderful
                    <br/>manifestation of the power of the 
                    <br/><span class="persName-GOD">God</span> of glory The invisibility of the 
                    <br/><span class="persName-GOD">Almighty</span> added to the mysterious ter
                    <br/>ror and grandeur of his descent
                    <br/>And can we suppose, that this 
                    <br/>was an introduction to anything 
                    <br/>of little moment, We must rather 
                    <br/>suppose, that something of the great
                    <br/>est importance was connected with
                    <br/>it, For when preparation is made 
                    <br/>in heaven, we may be sure, that
                    <br/><span class="persName-GOD">God</span> intends to show something wor
                    <br/>thy of the observation of men, and
                    <br/>of angels,  This is one of the very
                    <br/>grandest scenes that ever were
                    <br/>witnessed upon the earth or recor‐
                    <br/>ded in history, and, as such, we can
                    <br/>not expect that the subject which
                    <br/>it introduces, should likewise have
                    <br/>its grandeur consisting in outward
                    <br/>appearances,  For nature had alread
                    <br/>y done all that she could, she had
                    <br/>called together all her wonders, all her
                    <br/>terrors, all her majesty and its 
                    <br/>was impossible for her to have gone
                    <br/>beyond what she had already ac‐
                    <br/>complished, and we therefore do
                    <br/>not expect any thing of outward
                    <br/>visible grandeur, the subject then
                    <br/>to be introduced, must excel in
                    <br/>its moral worth which is infinitely
                    <br/>more impressive than any thing that
                    <br/>the mere concentrated phenomena of 
                    <br/>nature can show, or do.  <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> has al
                    <br/>ready, gathered together his thun‐
                    <br/>ders and his lightnings he has ar
                    <br/>rayed himself in clouds and fire,
                    <br/>he has caused the earth to quake from
                    <br/>its foundations, and has shaken the
                    <br/>stoutest heart of <span class="persName-ISRAEL">Israel</span>.  He then goes
                    <br/>into the other department, and brings
                    <div id="MS Sermon 002a" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>forward the world of morals,  It is
                    <br/>not my object at present to enter
                    <br/>into all the details of the law which was
                    <br/>introduced in such an awful manner
                    <br/>but rather to observe the general prin‐
                    <br/>ciple, the extent of its application, and the
                    <br/>manner of its fulfilment.</div>
            <br/>
            <div class="p">First, the law was intended to be
                    <br/>of universal extent, and to promote
                    <br/>honesty, and purity of society among
                    <br/>creatures and supreme attachment
                    <br/>to the <span class="persName-GOD">Creator</span>.  For there is no being
                    <br/>that has been formed for insula‐
                    <br/>ted existence,  We find in all the
                    <br/>desire to escape from solitude, and
                    <br/>to enter into the social, pure, and hon
                    <br/>est intercourse for which we were
                    <br/>made. for impurity tends to debase

                    <br/>iety would be the cause of its own an
                    <br/>nihilation, if it were impure.  No
                    <br/>shepherd was ever placed over placed

                    <br/>ways given them, in order to pro.
                    <br/>mote this pure, and honest society,?
                    <br/>But let us go still higher.  The an
                    <br/>gels have these faculties, and in a
                    <br/>much greater degree  They also are 
                    <br/>often set over us. and governors and

                    <br/>charge governing thee lest at any time
                    <br/>thou dash thy foot against a stone.
                    <br/>They therefore, it is evident, must
                    <br/>have the same faculties. We are told
                    <br/>that it is one of the objects of <span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span>
               <br/>to unite all these angels, and prin
                    <br/>cipalities, and powers,  This is another
                    <br/>proof of this intention of the law. A
                    <br/>gain we are to enter into an innum
                    <br/>merable company of angels, there are 
                    <br/>many other proofs which could be
                    <br/>deduced from scripture, and all show
                    <br/>ing that the principalities of the law
                    <div id="MS Sermon 003a" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>are all intended to purify this fellow‐
                    <br/>ship,  The injunction to which the whole
                    <br/>law was reduced by <span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span> is another
                    <br/>confirmation of the same opinion Thou 
                    <br/>shalt love the <span class="persName-GOD">Lord</span> thy <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> with all
                    <br/>thy heart, and soul, and strength, &
                    <br/>thy neighbor as thyself.  But I shall
                    <br/>say that this same law is binding. e
                    <br/>ven upon the fallen angels, I say that
                    <br/>it is also binding upon the fallen an
                    <br/>gels, it is binding though it may not
                    <br/>be obeyed, and this, and this only is
                    <br/>the course of the eternality of punishment
                    <br/>because their refusal to obey this uni‐
                    <br/>versal law is a principle coeval with
                    <br/>their existence, with their immortality
                    <br/>of existence, and the punishment must
                    <br/>be coeval with their existence also.  For,
                    <br/>among those who have passed into a 
                    <br/>state where probation is at an end, in
                    <br/>iniquity, there never can be a prin
                    <br/>ciple of pure and honest fellowship
                    <br/>they must continue there, in the
                    <br/>same state in which they had been
                    <br/>while upon the earth, Every thing must
                    <br/>cling to them, their sins and iniquity
                    <br/>must be augmented tenfold.  There ne‐
                    <br/>ver can be a principle of good fel‐
                    <br/>lowship here, and therefore the pun
                    <br/>ishment must correspondingly be everlasting.</div>
            <br/>
            <div class="p">But also this law, as well as uni
                    <br/>versally binding, is eternally bind‐

               <br/>very nature is sufficient confirmation
                    <br/>of this, and it therefore is not a mere

                    <br/>of enjoyment. a power which must
