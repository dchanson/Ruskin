            <div class="p">11. to 24 verse. VII. There is nothing more re‐
                    <br/>markable in the annals of history, than 
                    <br/>this grand operation of divine vengeance,
                    <br/>both as a manifestation of <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">Gods</span> justice,
                    <br/>& of his detestation of sin, and of his power
                    <br/>to punish it, except the sacrifice of his son.
                    <br/>We propose contemplating this great cat‐
                    <br/>astrophe, first in the preliminary circum‐
                    <br/>stances, which led to it. We have seen in
                    <br/>our previous observations, the vitiated, and 
                    <br/>corrupt state of the children of men, im‐
                    <br/>mediately before the flood. It is evident
                    <br/>that they could not continue long in this 
                    <br/>state, for the violence with which  they were
                    <br/>filled, would certainly, at no very distant 
                    <br/>period, have exterminated the human 
                    <br/>race. But <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> declares, in the 3rd verse
                    <br/>of the 6th chapter, that he will aticipate 
                    <br/>this extermination, My spirit shall 
                    <br/>not always strive with man, yet his days 
                    <br/>shall be an hundred and twenty years. 
                    <br/>Various applications have been made, of the 
                    <br/>number of years thus appointed, by <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span>.
                    <br/>Some think that it refers to the time
                    <br/>occupied in the construction of the Ark, 
                    <br/>after <span class="persName-NOAH">Noah</span> had received the first annun‐
                    <br/>ciation of the coming deluge; and others 
                    <br/>consider, that it refers to the general period 
                    <br/>of human life, which <span class="del-strikethrough">was</span> appear to have 
                    <br/>been greatly diminished, either immediate‐
                    <br/>ly before or after the flood. But, I rather 
                    <br/>think that it refers to neither of these 
                    <br/>circumstances, but that it announces, 
                    <br/>that one hundred, and twenty years, should be the period of human probation, that 
                    <br/>this probation should not always be con‐
                    <br/>tinued, that this time of strife and of
                    <br/>violence, should at last be ended by a sig‐
                    <br/>nal act of vengeance, We see, that no 
                    <div id="296805v_0006" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>directions are given at present, for the im‐
                    <br/>mediate construction of the ark, but that 
                    <br/>there is, in the intervening period, ample 
                    <br/>opportunity afforded to man, for repen‐
                    <br/>tance, and amendment, which might 
                    <br/>have been effected by the preaching of <span class="persName-NOAH">Noah</span> 
               <br/>for we have reason to believe, that <span class="persName-NOAH">Noah</span> did
                    <br/>exert himself in this <span class="del-strikethrough">per</span> manner, during 
                    <br/>the entire space of time between the first 
                    <br/>annunciation of <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">Gods</span> wrath, and the
                    <br/>final catastrophe, they had, I say, the 
                    <br/>diligent preaching of a faithful, and of 
                    <br/>a righteous man, during a hundred and 
                    <br/>twenty years, yet they would not hear

                    <br/>not abate, and thy continued in obsti‐

               <br/>have been turned from its wickedness, for 
                    <br/>the perverse race of man might have inf
                    <br/>erred, that the skill of the contrivance, and 
                    <br/>the magnitude of the undertaking, indic{ated} 
               <br/>something above their feeble capacities, some
                    <br/>thing like the assistance, and the superin‐
                    <br/>tendence, of an infinitely supreme, and pow
                    <br/>erful being. but still, they would not believe, 
                    <br/>they would not renounce any one of their 
                    <br/>evil practices There remains yet another pre
                    <br/>liminary to be mentioned, which, it might
                    <br/>be supposed, would have worked with them 
                    <br/>this was the entrance of the beasts and the 
                    <br/>birds and the creeping things into the ark. 
                    <br/>Through their obstinate infidelity, they might 
                    <br/>have doubted if the ark which <span class="persName-NOAH">Noah</span> was 
                    <br/>erecting, was in fact intended to preserve 
                    <br/>him, and his family from the deluge, but 
                    <div id="296805v_0007" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>how was it possible, that they could doubt
                    <br/>longer, when they saw the animal tribes 
                    <br/>of their own accord gathering round and 
                    <br/>entering into the ark, and that just in 
                    <br/>the numbers, and in
                    <br/>the order which <span class="persName-NOAH">Noah</span>

                    <br/>very strongest proofs on record, of the utter
                    <br/>wickedness of the human soul. For had men,
                    <br/>had human creatures only come to the ark,
                    <br/>they might have suspected some combin
                    <br/>ation to deceive them, into a belief in the
                    <br/>ful{fil}ment of <span class="persName-NOAH">Noahs</span> threatenings, but in 
                    <br/>the case of the brute creation, <span class="del-strikethrough">there</span> it
                    <br/>was evident there could be no combina‐

                    <br/>sible cause or reason for their unbelief
                    <br/>And can we then wonder, that after
                    <br/>one hundred and twenty years had
                    <br/> been allow{e}d them for consideration
                    <br/>and for repentance, and after that per
                    <br/>riod, so many infallible proofs had been
                    <br/>given them of the truth of those denun
                    <br/>ciations which were pressed upon them
                    <br/>by <span class="persName-NOAH">Noah</span>, can we wonder that after such
                    <br/>preliminaries as these the deluge should fol
                    <br/>low, and that after such longsuffering
                    <br/>the vengeance of heaven should be delay

                    <br/>which may be supposed to have actut‐

                    <br/>however suppose, that even when the foun

               <br/>which preserve all the species exist at the present time. And, in
                    <br/>deed, when we look upon the multitude
                    <br/>the amazing multitude of living beings
                    <br/>which surround us, we might, perhaps,
                    <br/>arrive at this inference. But, if we would
                    <br/>ascertain facts, we should <span class="del-strikethrough">co</span> remember
                    <br/>that all the classes of animals may be
                    <br/>reduced to a very few specimens, as it were
                    <br/>the stamina of the creation, from which
                    <br/>common stocks[,] the different and lesser
                    <br/>varieties, may be supposed to be derived
                    <br/>and we shall then find, that a modern
                    <br/>first rate line of battle ship, would be amp‐
                    <br/>ly sufficient to contain both the requi‐
                    <br/>site number of animals, and thier food
                    <br/>There remains now to be answered, only one
                    <br/>objection, of the least importance. We are
                    <br/>told, in the 19, of the 7th, that all the high hills
                    <br/>that were und{e}r the whole heaven, were co‐
                    <br/>vered; Now, it may be asked, where could
                    <br/>such a quantity of water be found, as,
                    <br/>would thus fill the lowest vallies, and co‐
                    <br/>ver the highest mountains. And, if the,
                    <br/>common order of nature, would ever ad
                    <br/>mit of such an event, why have we not
                    <br/>a more frequent recurrence of it. Now, if
                    <br/>we were to confine ourselves to the common
                    <br/>and present order of things, this objection would
                    <br/>be valid, But the deluge was, from its com‐
                    <br/>mencement, <span class="del-strikethrough">a</span><span class="add">e</span>ntirly a miraculous operation,
                    <br/>showing the extent of <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">Gods</span> indignation, a‐
                    <br/>gainst sin, and, considering it thus, this
                    <br/>phenomenon is no longer extraordinary, for
                    <br/>the same power, which afterwards multiplied
                    <br/>the loaves and fishes, could also have easily in‐
                    <br/>creased the bulk of the waters, for, if <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> ma‐
                    <br/>de. the whole, we must also allow that he guid‐
                    <br/>es the whole, and if he guides the whole. <span class="del-strikethrough">H</span> it
                    <br/>is evident he could alter the course of nature
                    <br/>Fossil shells also at the present day being found
                    <br/>on the summits of the highest Mountains
                    <br/>is another convincing evidence. Now lastly,
                    <br/>if we consider the introduction, and o‐
                    <br/>peration, of the flood from its commence
                    <div id="296805v_0011" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>ment, we see his great long suffering, and al
                    <br/>so his dreadful vengeance, If we look at
               <br/>this last, we dare not consider that <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> is
                    <br/>not alive to the depravity of Sin, and all
                    <br/>hope is taken away from us, except that
                    <br/>which has its foundation in the sacrifice
                    <br/>and atonement of him in whose blood only
                    <br/>lieth salvation.</div>
