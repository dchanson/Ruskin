            <div class="p">1st to 3rd verse. XII. We must fix our attention
                    <br/>to day, in the first place, upon the various dis
                    <br/>pensations, which have been, both before, and af
                    <br/>ter the flood, held forth to man, as the means
                    <br/>of his salvation. The first of these dispensa
                    <br/>tions, was that before the fall, which was en
                    <br/>tire perfection in the creature, and power to
                    <br/>obtain his own salavation, in consequence
                    <br/>of which, a proportionate demand was made
                    <br/>upon him, of perfect obedience, by his <span class="persName-fictional-CREATOR">Creator</span>.
                    <br/>But this perfection was lost, and the
                    <br/>power of obtaining salvation by that dispen
                    <br/>sation, was at an end. Then there came a
                    <br/>change, but it is to be observed, that it
                    <br/>was only a change of the creature, not of
                    <br/>the <span class="persName-fictional-CREATOR">Creator</span>, <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> made the same demands
                    <br/>upon man, but another mode was ordain
                    <br/>ed to him, of fulfilling them; The <span class="persName-fictional-CREATOR">Creator</span>
               <br/>was, and is, the same, under every
                    <br/>change and every dispensation and these
                    <br/>various changes were only different modes
                    <br/>of showing his glory, his justice, and his
                    <br/>soverignty, Now, we must bear in mind
                    <br/>that the dispensation after was quite uni
                    <br/>versal in its character, the promise of sal
                    <br/>vation was equally extended to all the hu
                    <br/>man race, it shut out none, and there
                    <br/>was no benefit given to one individual,
                    <br/>which was not attainable by all, it was
                    <br/>universal in efficacy, although it was not
                    <br/>so in facts, and it would also have been
                    <br/>on account of sin.</div>
            
            <div class="p">But this universality is now lost, in the
                    <br/>administration to <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>. A particular
                    <br/>nation is selected descending from a single
                    <br/>individual; But we should observe, that al
                    <div id="296805v_0019" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>though, this particular administration, is
                    <br/>limited, the former one is still continued
                    <br/>and still extending its benefits to all men,
                    <br/>it is an addition, not  limitation, it is
                    <br/>introduced into the former economy, with
                    <br/>out destroying it. And we have several
                    <br/>proofs of this. For under what dispensa
                    <br/>tion can we suppose what <span class="persName-MELCHISEDEK">Melchisedek</span> was
                    <br/>a high preist, Certainly under the first, and
                    <br/>not under the Abrahamic We may now
                    <br/>enter into the particulars of the calling of
                    <br/><span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>. 31st verse, 11. It may be as
                    <br/>ked, how <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>, as it is here told us
                    <br/>departed, with his family, from <span class="placeName-UR">Ur of Chaldees</span>,
                    <br/>apparently before he was called by
                    <br/><span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span>. But, I think it is evident that <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span>
               <br/>had appeared to him before he left <span class="persName-HUR">Hur</span> and
                    <br/>arrived in <span class="placeName-HARAN">Haran</span>. For, there is no doubt
                    <br/>that the beginning of the twelfth chapter
                    <br/>goes back to events which had happened
                    <br/>previously to his departure from <span class="placeName-UR">Ur</span>.
                    <br/>Let us look at the seventh chapter of <span class="title-scripture-ACTS">Acts</span>,
                    <br/>and the 2nd verse. <span class="persName-STEPHEN">Stephen</span> says, "The <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span>
               <br/>of Glory appeared unto our father <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>
               <br/>when he was in <span class="placeName-MESOPOTAMIA">Mesopotamia</span>, before he dwelt
                    <br/>in <span class="placeName-HARAN">Charran</span>, which is <span class="placeName-HARAN">Haran</span> , according
                    <br/>to the Greek pronunciation" and said un
                    <br/>to him Get thee out of thy country,
                    <br/>and from thy kindered and come into the land
                    <br/>which I shall show thee For taking the
                    <br/>order of the words in <span class="title-book-BIBLE">Genesis</span>, we should i 
                    <br/>magine, that <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> was called after
                    <br/>he had dwelt in <span class="placeName-HARAN">Haran</span>, or <span class="placeName-HARAN">Charran</span>, but we
                    <br/>may be sure, that <span class="persName-STEPHEN">Stephen</span> and <span class="persName-MOSES">Moses</span> were
                    <br/>in perfect unison, and that, as <span class="persName-MOSES">Moses</span> says
                    <br/>"the <span class="persName-LORD">Lord</span> had said to Abram," the seeming 
               <br/>contradiction is only from the transposi
                    <br/>tion of the words</div>
            
            <div class="p">We may next consider the situation of
                    <br/><span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> and his family his religious views
                    <br/>, and condition, before he was called, in or
                    <br/>der to preserve the worship of the True <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span>,
                    <br/>who was, at this period, almost entirely
                    <br/>forgotten, amid the depravity and idolatry
                    <br/>so generally prevailing, prevailing so com
                    <br/>pletely indeed, that we have authority
                    <br/>for supposing that there were idols, even
                    <div id="296805_0020" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>even in <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abrahams</span> own family; Now, if
                    <br/>this state of things had continued for a very
                    <br/>small time longer, the earth would have been
                    <br/>left without one single testimony of even the
                    <br/>existence of the true <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span>. It was therefor nec
                    <br/>essary, immediately to bring <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> away
                    <br/>from his house, and from his kindered, and to
                    <br/>wean him from the worship of the Idols, which
                    <br/>were placed even in his own house. For, we
                    <br/>read in the twenty fourth chapter of <span class="persName-JOSHUA">Joshua</span>, and
                    <br/>the second verse, "Your fathers dwelt on the other
                    <br/>side of the flood in old time, (that is, on the other
                    <br/>side of the river <span class="geogName-EUPHRATES">Euphrates</span>; which was called the
                    <br/>flood, because it was the largest river then
                    <br/>known; and not meaning the deluge) even <span class="persName-TERAH">Terah</span>,
                    <br/>the father of <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> and the father of
                    <br/>Nahor, and they served other <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">Gods</span>," it is distinct
                    <br/>ly stated that they were Idolaters, and al
                    <br/>though it does not positively affirm, that
                    <br/><span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> himself was a worshipper of idols
                    <br/>, yet, I think we may suppose him to have
                    <br/>been so, before he was called of <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span>, and his
                    <br/>future blessings announced to him.</div>
            
            <div class="p">In these blessings, there are a few particulars
                    <br/>which may be severally noticed. There is,
                    <br/>first, a simple promise made to <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>
               <br/>that the <span class="persName-LORD">Lord</span> will shew him a land, there
                    <br/>is nothing more, there is no imitation
                    <br/>given as to its character, its name, or its po
                    <br/>sition, it is not said whether it shall be
                    <br/>barren, or fruitful, large, or small, desert
                    <br/>or inhabited. He is left to exercise his
                    <br/>faith, he must leave his house, his coun
                    <br/>try, his kindred, and he must trust all
                    <br/>his interests in the hands of his <span class="persName-fictional-CREATOR">Creator</span>.
                    <br/>This however, he does, and what without a
                    <br/>moments hesitation, as the <span class="persName-LORD">Lord</span> had spo
                    <br/>ken unto him, and his instant and willing
                    <br/>compliance presents us with an example
                    <br/>of what our conduct ought invariably
                    <br/>to be, with regard to the promises of
                    <br/><span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span>. But how much, how con
                    <br/>stantly we deviate from the rule of con
                    <br/>duct which the patriarch has, in this
                    <br/>instance, so strictly observed. How daily,
                    <br/>how hourly, are we wishing, and even
                    <br/>stipulating to the <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">Almighty</span> to under
                    <br/>stand the entire bearing of everything
                    <br/>which is written in <span class="title-book-BIBLE">Scripture</span>, 
               <div id="296805v_0021" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>When we ought, without a moments hes
                    <br/>itation, to trust ourselves, and our con
                    <br/>cerns wholly to the keeping, and man
                    <br/>agement, of a true, kind, and a faith
                    <br/>ful <span class="persName-fictional-CREATOR">Creator</span>, we are as suspicious
                    <br/>as if we were moving in the country
                    <br/>of an artful, and vigilant enemy, and
                    <br/>where an ambush was laid for us in every
                    <br/>thicket. How different how exceedingly
                    <br/>different, was the spirit of <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>. He
                    <br/>knew only, but he knew that certainly
                    <br/>that <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> had spoken, and that the
                    <br/>path which he had to follow, was in
                    <br/>stant and unhesitating confidence, &
                    <br/>he therefore waits for nothing more. If
                    <br/>we were to follow his example, and, ha
                    <br/>ving seen some of the promises clearly
                    <br/>and completely fulfilled, will believe
                    <br/>that those which are yet obscure to us,
                    <br/>shall, in time, be discovered to be e
                    <br/>qually true we shall then be able to
                    <br/>travel on fearlessly, with such a
                    <br/>degree of firmness as will enable us,
                    <br/>trusting in the faith of our <span class="persName-fictional-CREATOR">Creator</span>, to
                    <br/>relieve our minds from all worldly f
                    <br/>ears and troubles. Let us remember, that
                    <br/>very few promises indeed had been made
                    <br/>to <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>, in comparison of the num
                    <br/>ber which have been delivered to us, and,
                    <br/>that, of those few, none had been hither
                    <br/>to fulfilled, that he saw those prophe
                    <br/>cies only under an obscure and dawn
                    <br/>ing light, which are seen by us under
                    <br/>a full blaze of noontide splendour, and let
                    <br/>us then who rise so far above in the
                    <br/>degree of explicitness belonging  to those
                    <br/>prophecies which we are required and co
                    <br/>mmanded to trust to, not fall far be
                    <br/>low him in either the greatness, or 
                    <br/>the readiness of our faith.</div>
            
            <div class="p">The next article of this promise, is, that
                    <br/>the <span class="persName-LORD">Lord</span> will make of <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> a great
                    <br/>nation, showing, what we have men
                    <br/>tioned before, that the Abrahamic dis
                    <br/>pensation was limited to a peculiar
                    <br/>nation, the descendants of <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>, al

                    <br/>to the test, but it fails not The verse
                    <br/>goes on I will bless thee. Now, we should
                    <br/>remark here, that to be made a great
                    <br/>nation alone might, or might not be a

                    <br/> and it is therefore, this blessing,
                    <br/>which constitutes what is really good
                    <br/>or desireable, in every thing. We might
                    <br/>suppose kingdoms and rulers and nations
                    <br/>to be submitted to <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>, or forces,
                    <br/>and wealth and power, and dominion, to
                    <br/>be given unto him, but if we suppose
                    <br/>him alone possessed of infinitely
                    <br/>more than all these, and beyond the
                    <br/>power of man to injure him, while on the
                    <br/>other hand, though he might be endowed
                    <br/>with every good thing which earth
                    <br/>could bestow upon him, if we suppose
                    <br/>him void of divine grace, we suppose
                    <br/>him unblest, with every blessing, and un
                    <br/>happy with every happiness, while the pow
                    <br/>er in which lay his pride, or the domin
                    <br/>ion in which lay his power, might, in
                    <br/>the end, only prove preludes to his fear
                    <br/>ful and irrrevocable overthrow. It is
                    <br/>only when the blessing of <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> rests
                    <br/>upon a man, that we can imagine
                    <br/>him happy, or upon a nation, that
                    <br/>we can imagine it great.</div>
            
            <div class="p">Again, it is promised to him, that his
                    <br/>name shall be made great. Now, we
                    <br/>are not to infer from this, that <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>
               <br/>desired a great name. On the contra
                    <br/>ry had he desired it, it would most probably
                    <br/>not have been granted him, because, we
                    <br/> may be sure, that this was not to min
                    <br/>ister to his pride, but to support his
                    <div id="296805v_0023" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>weakness. It was to encourage him in his
                    <br/>humble simplicity, and in order that he might
                    <br/>not yield to any despondency, which, other
                    <br/>wise, might have overcome him, when he
                    <br/>found himself in a strange land, where the
                    <br/><span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> whom he served was not known, and far
                    <br/>from his own his own country, his kin
                    <br/>dred, his friends, and his family. The pro
                    <br/>mise to make his name great, was to
                    <br/>encourage his diffidence, and not to sup
                    <br/>port his ambition.</div>
            
            <div class="p">The next promise, is, that he shall be
                    <br/>a blessing. This is a very great, and im
                    <br/>portant addition, to the former promise,
                    <br/>that he should be blessed. For, had this
                    <br/>only been granted him, his enjoyment
                    <br/>would have been personal only, he would
                    <br/>have stood alone, and his happiness would
                    <br/>have been greatly cloyed, by seeing the
                    <br/>misery, the vice, the violence, and the dep
                    <br/>ravity with which he was surrounded.
                    <br/>We cannot suppose one, who has attained
                    <br/>a tall rock, in the middle of a tempes
                    <br/>tuous ocean, and who sees his fellow‐be
                    <br/>ings perishing around him to be hap
                    <br/>py, although we may suppose him thank
                    <br/>ful, and we cannot suppose, that <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>
               <br/>would have been supremely happy,
                    <br/>although blest with all the good that
                    <br/>earth or heaven could give, had that
                    <br/>blessing been only personal: But, was it
                    <br/>not a great encouragement to him, when
                    <br/>he knew, that wherever he went, his pre
                    <br/>sence should scatter blessings on every
                    <br/>one around, that mirth should fol
                    <br/>low his footsteps, and gladness accom
                    <br/>pany his presence. This would se
                    <br/>cure the blessings of all around him, en
                    <br/>vy would not detract him, and malice
                    <br/>would not injure him, his benevolence
                    <br/>would be gratified, and his selfishness
                    <br/>forgotten, or subdued. Now, it may
                    <br/>be asked, if this circumstance, that <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>
               <br/>should be a blessing to all, was
                    <br/>not inconsistent with, or contradic
                    <br/>tory to, the limitation, the peculiar
                    <br/>limitation, of the Abrahamic dipsen
                    <br/>sation. We would answer No. For

               <br/>although, on account of the peculiar cir
                    <br/>cumstances in which the patriarch was
                    <br/>placed, he might be forced so far, to en
                    <br/>ter into correspondence with the idolaters
                    <br/>by whom he was surrounded, and although
                    <br/>this correspondence might, in some de
                    <br/>gree bring a blessing upon them, although
                    <br/>he might, enter into traffic with them
                    <br/>and buy and sell, (as we see from the 9th
                    <br/>and following verses of the XXIII Chapter
                    <br/>that he bought a cave, from <span class="placeName-EPHRON">Ephron</span>, of
                    <br/>the children, of <span class="persName-HETH">Heth</span>, for four hundreds
                    <br/>shekels of silver) yet we cannot suppos
                    <br/>that he was intimate with them. <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span>
               <br/> had pointed out to him the path which
                    <br/>he was to follow, and that was one of
                    <br/>entire seclusion and seperation, from
                    <br/>the rest of mankind, and it was his
                    <br/>bounden duty, under all circumstances
                    <br/>to stand aloof from all the worshippers
                    <br/>of other <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">Gods</span>, and to adhere to this se
                    <br/>vere rule so strictly, as even to with
                    <br/>draw himself from his own family, &
                    <br/>friends, when these went after unknown
                    <br/>gods, in short, all, that the smallest de
                    <br/>gree would interpose between him, and
                    <br/>the <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> whose servant he had been
                    <br/>appointed, must be entirely set aside.
                    <br/>And, let me say, that this should
                    <br/>be our line of conduct at the present
                    <br/>day, we should stand aloof from every
                    <br/>thing that, would seperate us, and our
                    <br/>heavenly <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">Father</span>. We must not enter
                    <br/>more into correspondence with world
                    <br/>ly men more than is absolutely neces
                    <br/>sary, we must set the world and the
                    <br/>things of the world aside, or we shall
                    <br/>share in their ruin. Lot did not ad
                    <br/>here strictly to this rul, but entered in
                    <br/>to an alliance with the people of <span class="placeName-SODOM">Sodom</span>
               <br/>and <span class="placeName-GOMORRAH">Gomorrah</span>, and although he himself
                    <br/>by a timely flight was enabled to es
                    <br/>cape, yet we know, that one individ
                    <br/>ual of his family, who left the city
                    <br/>of the idolaters with delay, and regret,
                    <br/>was overtaken by the same destruction
                    <br/>Let this, my friends be a warning to
                    <br/>us, and let us remember, that the less
                    <div id="296805v_0025" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>we have to do with the things of this
                    <br/>world, the better we are preparing for anoth
                    <br/>er.</div>
            
            <div class="p">Again, the verse goes on, to say that <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span>
               <br/>not only will bless the friends of <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>
               <br/>but will set himself against his enemies
                    <br/>Still, we observe that is exactly the line of
                    <br/>enemies of his people may perhaps triumph
                    <br/>on the earth, but their triumph will be
                    <br/>but of short duration, and <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> will, in
                    <br/>the latter end, bring them to a fearful
                    <br/>account, for in all these things, we are
                    <br/>more than conquerors. Even on the ear
                    <br/>th, when he hath flourished for a little
                    <br/>time like a flower of the field, and spread
                    <br/>out his branches, like a green olive tree,
                    <br/>by the rivers of waters, yet but a little
                    <br/>while, and he passeth away, and the
                    <br/>place thereof shall know it no more
                    <br/>We have an example of this, in the battle
                    <br/>of kings, in which we are told that
                    <br/><span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>, with three hundred and eigh
                    <br/>teen men, defeated the forces of the five
                    <br/>combined kings.
                    <br/>We now come to the last, but the prin
                    <br/>cipal part of this blessing, I say the prin
                    <br/>cipal, because in this part, the dispen
                    <br/>sation, which before was confined to
                    <br/>one peculiar nation, is here extended
                    <br/>to all the nations of the earth, "and in
                    <br/>thee shall all families of the earth, be
                    <br/>blessed. This part of the covenant, with
                    <br/>out doubt, refers to <span class="persName-LORD">Christ</span>, who, being
                    <br/>one ofthe descendants of <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>, yet
                    <br/>extends the Abrahamic dispensation,
                    <br/>through his death, to the Jew, and the
                    <br/>Gentile, to the bond and the free, to all,
                    <br/>who will believe on him. Such were
                    <br/>the various circumstances of the Abra
                    <br/>hamic dispensation. And now, my
                    <br/>friends let me repeat, for I cannot
                    <br/>too often impress it upon you, how very
                    <br/>striking an instance, of the blessed pow

                    <br/>of <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>, on this occasion, <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>
               <br/> believed, and was steady in that
