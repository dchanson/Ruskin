                    <br/>this part of the Mosaic narrative, we 
                    <br/>have a most imprtant subject presen
                    <br/>ted to us, for when we take the church

                    <br/>ing from strength to strength, daily & 
                    <br/>rapidly increasing among in the midst 
                    <br/>of all endeavours to suppress it, we un

                    <br/>the Providence which brought it up 
                    <br/>than we could possibly do, if we on
                    <br/>ly considered it in its present ma
                    <br/>ture and flourishing state of perfection 
                    <div id="Ruskin_MA_3451_296806_Verso_5.jpg" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>We must first, in order fully to under
                    <br/>stand this subject, remember the condit
                    <br/>ion of the Israelites, before <span class="persName-JOSEPH">Joseph</span>ʼs death 
                    <br/>We are told, that when <span class="persName-JACOB">Jacob</span>, and his 
                    <br/>family first came up into <span class="placeName-EGYPT">Egypt</span>, they 
                    <br/>had possessions in flocks and herds, they 
                    <br/>had been shepherds from their youth, and 
                    <br/>Pharaoh therefore, in requital of the ser
                    <br/>vices of <span class="persName-JOSEPH">Joseph</span>, established them in the 
                    <br/>land of <span class="placeName-GOSHEN">Goshen</span>, because it was a fruit
                    <br/>ful land, and fit for cattle. And there-
                    <br/>fore, during the life of Pharoah, being un
                    <br/>der the favour of the King, and placed 
                    <br/>in an eligible situation, we may sup
                    <br/>pose that they accumulated very much 
                    <br/>wealth of this sort, and at the death of 
                    <br/>Pharaoh. were in a most prosperous, & 
                    <br/>flourishing condition, till another king 
                    <br/>arose, which knew not <span class="persName-JOSEPH">Joseph</span>. Now, 
                    <br/>if we ask how the very numerous and 
                    <br/>important services of <span class="persName-JOSEPH">Joseph</span>, could 
                    <br/>be so soon forgotten, we would reply 
                    <br/>that it can be accounted for in no 
                    <br/>other way than by considering the na
                    <br/>ture of human gratitude, Some, 
                    <br/>affirm, that the new king was a 
                    <br/>usurper, and feared the proximity of 
                    <br/>the Israelites because they had now 
                    <br/>become a very powerful people, and, ha
                    <br/>ving experienced many benefits from 
                    <br/>the former monarch, might perhaps 
                    <br/>assist the native Egyptians, in depos
                    <br/>ing him from the throne which he __. 
                    <br/>But this is a mere supposition, de
                    <br/>duced only from the kings forgetfulness of the. 
                    <br/>many services of <span class="persName-JOSEPH">Joseph</span>, we have 
                    <br/>no evidence of th fact, but on the 
                    <br/>contrary have very strong evidence 
                    <br/>against it. for we are assured, in a 
                    <br/>number of ancient historical re
                    <br/>cords, that a disturbance, a revoluti
                    <br/>on of this kind had taken place 
                    <br/>before <span class="persName-JOSEPH">Joseph</span> was carried into <span class="placeName-">Egypt</span> 
               <br/>very long before that time indeed, 
                    <br/>and had retained the throne for a con
                    <br/>siderable period, and also, that the sov
                    <br/>reign who received <span class="persName-JOSEPH">Joseph</span>, was in fact 
                    <br/>the first of the native kings, who 
                    <br/>was enabled to reassume the throne of 
                    <br/>which his ancestors had been deprivʼd 
                    <br/>and we surely cannot suppose it to 
                    <div id="Ruskin_MA_3451_296806_Recto_6.jpg" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>be likely, that another revolution of the 
                    <br/>same kind, should have taken place, 
                    <br/>within a period so short. It is exceeding
                    <br/>ly improbable that this king could have 
                    <br/>been a usurper, and it is impossible, that 
                    <br/>the expression “knew not <span class="persName-JOSEPH">Joseph</span>” can signify 
                    <br/>that he was ignorant of the services he 
                    <br/>had so publicly rendered to his prede
                    <br/>cessor, and indeed to all the Egyptians, 
                    <br/>The fame of one, who had not only fore
                    <br/>told the coming of the seven years fam
                    <br/>ine, but had preserved (most likely) a 
                    <br/>very great part of a whole nation, 
                    <br/>from death, or from ruin, must have, 
                    <br/>been noised abroad long after that 
                    <br/>person had ceased to exist, and <span class="persName-JOSEPH">Joseph</span> 
               <br/>was still living; In short, we can only 
                    <br/>suppose, that this expression signifies, 
                    <br/>not that the new king was ignorant 
                    <br/>of the great and manifold services of 
                    <br/><span class="persName-JOSEPH">Joseph</span>, but that he was resolved not 
                    <br/>to reward them, he was jealous of a 
                    <br/>people who were becoming excedingly 
                    <br/>powerful, and who occupied, it may be 
                    <br/>supposed, a very large portion of his 
                    <br/>dominions. It is evident, that Phar
                    <br/>aoh could have had no idea of the di
                    <br/>vine economy, by which the children of 
                    <br/><span class="placeName-ISRAEL">Israel</span> were to be brought up out of 
                    <br/><span class="placeName-EGYPT">Egypt</span>, and wander through many dangers 
                    <br/>till at last they were to be established 
                    <br/>in the land of promise, for, otherwise, he 
                    <br/>could not have been jealous of a people 
                    <br/>whose interference or <div 
              class="add-above" 
              style="left:8.8em">or power</div> he could not then 
                    <br/>have dreaded.</div>
            <br/>
            <div class="p">But, besides this jealousy, there was 
                    <br/>another very devious reason why Phar
                    <br/>aoh treated the children of <span class="placeName-ISRAEL">Israel</span>, thus 
                    <br/>hardly. The<span class="del-strikethrough">r</span>y were settled in <span class="placeName-EGYPT">Egypt</span> for 
                    <br/>their own advantage, not for, Pharaohs, 
                    <br/>The king of <span class="placeName-EGYPT">Egypt</span> not only wished to 
                    <br/>prevent the children of <span class="placeName-ISRAEL">Israel</span> from ri
                    <br/>sing against him, but to compel them 
                    <br/>to labour for him, The advantages to 
                    <br/>Pharaoh, which would be derived from 
                    <br/>the united labour of a nation so nu
                    <br/>merous, and so powerful, cannot but 
                    <br/>have been considerable, it would enrich 
                    <br/>his treasury, and it would increase his, 
                    <br/>power. Now the expression “Let us deal 
                    <br/>wisely with them,” signifies, I rather 
                    <br/>think, let us deal cunningly with them 
                    <br/>let us endeavour to turn their sojourn 
                    <br/>in <span class="placeName-EGYPT">Egypt</span> to our own advantage, for it 
                    <br/>was not a thing wise in itself, to 
                    <br/>oppress the Israelites, or deal tyrannically
                    <div id="Ruskin_MA_3451_296806_Verso_6.jpg" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>with them, on the contrary this would 
                    <br/>provoke their hatred, and might have. 
                    <br/>accelerated their rebellion.  In pursuance 
                    <br/>therefore of this resolution, “let us deal. 
                    <br/>wisely or cunningly with them,” we are 
                    <br/>told that Pharoah set over them task 
                    <br/>masters, in order to cause them to la
                    <br/>bour constantly, and to secure their 
                    <br/>labour for himself, And they built

               <br/>which bordered upon <span class="placeName-PHILISTIA">Philistia</span>, and was 
                    <br/>therefore always exposed to, and had of 
                    <br/>ten experienced foraging incursions 
                    <br/>from the Philistines, or more serious

                    <br/>fore, to have ben two fortified cities, 
                    <br/>built for the purpose of containing stores

               <br/>and bowed down to Idols, had it not 
                    <br/>been for their indecision this it was that 
                    <br/>permitted such an invasion of their 
                    <br/>sacred character, And <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> permitted
                    <br/>the visitation on account of this. And 
                    <br/>if there were not in us such a decis
