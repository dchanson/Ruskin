                    <br/>ration.  I have read these words, in
                    <br/>order, that through them, I may be
                    <br/>enabled to make some general rem
                    <br/>arks, on the lives, the habits and the
                    <br/>acts of the patriarchs, and these most
                    <br/>certainly require attention, in order, to
                    <br/>discover the amount of the privileges,
                    <br/>which they enjoyed, and also, the uses,
                    <br/>which they made of those privileges
                    <br/>Now, the whole family of <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, had
                    <br/>formerly, and have now, clear statement,
                    <br/>and evidences, capable of proving the per
                    <br/>fect truth of those statements, but they
                    <br/>neither had, nor have, such a clear,
                    <br/>and certain application of the gospel, to
                    <br/>individuals, as may be capable, of—at

                    <br/>for the pledges and promises (of the
                    <br/>truth of which no doubt could possib
                    <br/>ly be entertained, inasmuch as this was
                    <br/>a period, in which visions, and direct
                    <br/>communications with <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, were, by
                    <br/>no means uncommon) were, in fact
                    <br/>redeemed to the ancient Patriarchs, &
                    <br/>in pursuance of this design, I should
                    <br/>wish first to make a few remarks, upon
                    <br/>the character of the blessings.  And we
                    <br/>shall therefore refer to the twenty sixth
                    <br/>Chapter of <span class="title-scripture-GENESIS">Genesis</span>, in which at the third
                    <br/>verse, we find the blessing pronounced by
                    <br/>the <span class="persName-GOD">Lord</span> upon <span class="persName-ISAAC">Isaac</span>,.”  Sojourn in this
                    <br/>land, and I will be with thee, and will
                    <br/>bless thee, for unto thee and to thy seed
                    <br/>I will give all these countries and I
                    <br/>will perform the oath which I swore
                    <br/>unto <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span> thy father, &c. —  We
                    <br/>find, that this blessing was essen
                    <br/>tially the same with that at first pro
                    <br/>nounced upon <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span>, and which
                    <br/>was transferred from father to son.
                    <br/>by <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> himself.  It was again trans
                    <br/>ferred from <span class="persName-ISAAC">Isaac</span> to <span class="persName-JACOB">Jacob</span>, twenty‐se
                    <br/>venth, chapter, 27 verse,  But still, there
                    <br/>remains a very great indistinctness, &
                    <br/>generality, in the stating of all these
                    <br/>blessings, which were transferred from
                    <br/><span class="persName-Abraham">Abraham</span> to <span class="persName-ISAAC">Isaac</span>, and from <span class="persName-ISAAC">Isaac</span>,
                    <br/>to <span class="persName-JACOB">Jacob</span>,  They are remarkable,  be‐
                    <br/>cause they combine such a remarka
                    <br/>ble degree of certainty, with so much
                    <br/>generality.  They were so vague as to 
                    <br/>leave ample reason for the patriarchs
                    <br/>to exercise there faith and there was
                    <br/>sufficient and certain evidence to af
                    <br/>ford ground for that faith.  But when
                    <br/>the faith however strong it might
                    <br/>be, was only extended to the truth
                    <br/>of the promises, and not to their ap
                    <br/>preciation, it gave room for very great
                    <br/>errors, as in the instance of <span class="persName-ESAU">Esau</span> and
                    <br/><span class="persName-JACOB">Jacob</span>.  <span class="persName-ESAU">Esau</span> was the elder, and <span class="persName-JACOB">Jacob</span>
               <br/>the younger, but <span class="persName-JACOB">Jacob</span> was the favou

               <br/>rite of his mother, and the practised fraud
                    <br/>to obtain for him a blessing of which, althoug
               <br/>she knew the certain and positive truth
                    <br/>yet the personal application of which
                    <br/>she knew not.  We have however, many
                    <br/>instances of the same feeling, throughout
                    <br/>all the lives of the patriarchs, occasioned
                    <br/>by this imperfect kind of faith, but this
                    <br/>does not atall, excuse the proceeding.  At
                    <br/>the present time, we know the certainty 
                    <br/>of salvation through <span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span> the certain 
                    <br/>ty of general salvation is attested by suf
                    <br/>ficient evidence, but still, it is dif
                    <br/>ficult to apply it personally, to bring
                    <br/>it home to ourselves, there we have 
                    <br/>doubts, and fears, and faulterings, we be
                    <br/>lieve, but we cannot apply, and we know
                    <br/>but we cannot trust, It is this, which 
                    <br/>causes us now, not to be sufficiently attach
                    <br/>ed to the word of God, we hear of the word kingdom of 
                    <br/><span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, and we believe in its truth, and yet
                    <br/>we will not exert ourselves in order to ob
                    <br/>tain it.  I call your, own experience to
                    <br/>witness that this is the fact although it 
                    <br/>might <span class="del-strikethrough">als</span> be inferred <span class="del-strikethrough">fr</span> merely from the 
                    <br/>nature of the human mind.  Let us es
                    <br/>cape as much as possible from this kind of
                    <br/>feeling which so frequently influenced the
                    <br/>actions of the patriarchs, and let us en
                    <br/>deavour to imitate their settled habits, not
                    <br/>the incidental actions, which sometimes were
                    <br/>contrary to those habits  But it may be
                    <br/>asked if this state of mind exists now, 
                    <br/>how can we escape from sin.  Now, the
                    <br/>promises say. the blood of <span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span> cleanseth 
                    <br/>from all sin, and our only inquiry must
                    <br/>be,  Have we accepted this blood, For the
                    <br/>doubting state of mind must all be traced
                    <br/>to unbelief  There must be some doubt of 
                    <br/>the testimony of <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, if we cannot make
                    <br/>it ours.  There cannot be entire belief in the
                    <br/>truth combined, with want of faith in per
                    <br/>sonal application  But if, in some cases;
                    <br/>we find this state of mind on the part 
                    <br/>of the patriarchs, let us observe the particu
                    <br/>lars of <span class="del-strikethrough">part</span> some of the actions occaison
                    <br/>ed by that doubt.  <span class="persName-JACOB">Jacob</span> was instruc‐
                    <br/>ted to practise fraud, in order to obtain
                    <br/>the blessing of a <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> who was altogether ho
                    <br/>ly and just, <span class="persName-REBEKAH">Rebecca</span> must, have had a
                    <br/>strange idea of the blessing of <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, to sup
                    <br/>pose that it was to be obtained in this 
                    <br/>manner, We must suppose that she was
                    <div id="Ruskin_MA_3451_296806_Recto_4" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>either altogether ignorant of the attribut
                    <br/>es of the <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> whose blessing she thus
                    <br/>endeavoured to obtain, or else, that she 
                    <br/>had at the time entirely forgotten them
                    <br/>We would bring this before you, in order
                    <br/>to show how persons may be led away 
                    <br/>by their own views.  Can we say, that
                    <br/>there is nothing done among us at the
                    <br/>present day, which resembles this action
                    <br/>of <span class="persName-REBEKAH">Rebecca</span>s.  <span class="del-strikethrough">These d</span> In these days, as

                    <br/><span class="persName-GOD">Almighty</span>, yet this did not <span class="del">hinder</span> pre
                    <br/>vent these actions from taking place. &,
                    <br/>in the same way although we have seen
                    <br/>the fulfilment of the promises yet this
                    <br/>cannot prevent similar feelings.  I will not
                    <br/>say what they may be, every one must‐
                    <br/>know that within himself, And we see
                    <br/>that although the fraud might be said to
                    <br/>have obtained a partial blessing, yet it was
                    <br/>attended with infinite misery, one torment
                    <br/>ing circumstance succeeded another, and 
                    <br/>at the end of his life he was obliged to
                    <br/>confess, that “Few and evil have been the
                    <br/>days of my pilgrimage.  I am afraid that
                    <br/>many parents at the present day, fol
                    <br/>low the example of <span class="persName-REBEKAH">Rebecca</span> in endeavou

                    <br/>of their children, that for the future ben
                    <br/>efit.  Perhaps they would be warned, if they 
                    <br/>would consider the circumstances attendant
                    <br/>upon the very partial blessings of which Re

            <div class="p">Again.  We cannot dwell upon all the 
                    <br/>circumstances of the life of <span class="persName-JOSEPH">Joseph</span>, but it
                    <br/>affords a sufficient number of instances of 
                    <br/>the same feeling, We find in the first place
                    <br/>providence permitting him to be carried in
                    <br/>to <span class="placeName-EGYPT">Egypt</span>, in order <span class="del-strikethrough">that</span> to promote his fu

                    <br/>and we must next consider what influ

                    <br/>seven years which must since have elapsed &

                    <br/>his brethren to recognise him, while theirs
                    <br/>remained exactly the same, But we find
                    <br/>that although <span class="persName-JOSEPH">Joseph</span> recognised them at 
                    <br/>once, yet he said that they were spies,

                    <br/>been considerable, we find that during a

                    <br/>about the welfare of his father and made 
                    <br/>no inquiry after him. we might have
                    <br/>expected that as soon as the famine com‐
                    <br/>menced, he would <span class="del-strikethrough">have</span> at least then
                    <br/>have informed his father of his prosper
                    <br/>ity and desired him to come to up into <span class="placeName-EGYPT">Egypt</span> 
               <br/>in order that he might be able to assist 
                    <br/>him, but we find him doing nothing 
                    <br/>of the kind. This conduct was not worthy 
                    <br/>of the rank to which he had attained al
                    <br/>though it was most likely this elevation 
                    <br/>which affected his principles and caused
                    <br/>him to act in this manner.  I know  
                    <br/>that the history of <span class="persName-JOSEPH">Joseph</span> has been com‐
                    <br/>monly held up in quite a different 
                    <br/>light, It has been considered as an entertain
                    <br/>ing tale, and an excellent example, while,
                    <br/>on the contrary, the view which I have 
                    <br/>taken <span class="del-strikethrough">Joseph</span> of this subject appears to 
                    <br/>bring down his actions from ideal to real,
                    <br/>and to the common level of human nat
                    <br/>ure. and we find that the effect which 
                    <br/>it produced on his brothers was the same 
                    <br/>as that with which it has struck me
                    <br/>(5 verse of 50 chapter) And when <span class="persName-JOSEPH">Joseph</span>s
                    <br/>brethren saw that their father was dead they
                    <br/>said “<span class="persName-JOSEPH">Joseph</span> will peradventure hate us and
                    <br/>will certainly requite us all the evil which
                    <br/>we did unto him; They were more.
                    <br/>struck with the incident than with 
                    <div id="Ruskin_MA_3451_296806_Recto_5" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>the habits, which was probably caused by their
                    <br/>being as soon as they came into <span class="placeName-EGYPT">Egypt</span>, sent
                    <br/>into the Land of <span class="placeName-GOSHEN">Goshen</span> were being at some
                    <br/>distance from the court they could not
                    <br/>have an opportunity of witnessing the hab
                    <br/>its of <span class="persName-JOSEPH">Joseph</span>.  The impression on <span class="persName-JACOB">Jacob</span> was, 
                    <br/>we find, the same,.  Now I do not say this,
                    <br/>in order to blot a character in other cir‐
                    <br/>cumstances so fair, but in order to be enabled
                    <br/>to derive benefit from it. Let us always 
                    <br/>flee from pride with abhorrence. Pride
                    <br/>was <span class="persName-JOSEPH">Joseph</span>s bane, How much more con-
                    <br/>sistent would it have been, had he sent
                    <br/>to his fathers home, and communicated. 
                    <br/>with him, informed him of his prosperity
                    <br/>and invited him to share it.  But no, on 
                    <br/>the contrary he adopted the practises of the
                    <br/>Pagan court in ee which he was, and instead
                    <br/>of producing any thing like the object which
                    <br/>I think erroneously he is said to have
                    <br/>had in view, namely to <span class="del-strikethrough">com</span> soften his
                    <br/>brethren and cause them to repent, he only
                    <br/>made them fear him. And, had <span class="persName-JOSEPH">Joseph</span>
               <br/>previously been told of the conduct which
                    <br/>he afterwards observed toward his breth
                    <br/>ren he might have said like <span class="persName-HAZAEL">Hazel</span>
               <br/>to the <span class="persName-ELISHA">prophet of Damascus</span>, "Is thy ser
                    <br/>vant a dog, that he should do this 
                    <br/>thing.  Let us therefore never say, I can
                    <br/>not, I will not do this, or that, but 
                    <br/>let us cast ourselves entirely on the will
                    <br/>of <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, and thus endeavour to escape from 
                    <br/>the short comings, and cling to the settled 
                    <br/>and exemplary habits of which an example
                    <br/>is so constantly and steadily held forth
                    <br/>to us as a lamp unto our feet and a light
                    <br/>unto our path in the various and remar
