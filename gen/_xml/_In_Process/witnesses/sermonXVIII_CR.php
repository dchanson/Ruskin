                    <br/>I have already directed your attention
                    <br/>to the first five of the ten commandments,
                    <br/>we must now devote some of out time
                    <br/>to the examination of the 6th, a precept
                    <br/>which although it forbids what all do
                    <br/>not consider crime, yet was decidadly ne
                    <br/>cessary to regulate the conduct of that de‐
                    <br/>praved people to whom <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> addressed
                    <br/>it. A variety of views have been taken
                    <br/>of it, and many doubts raised concern‐
                    <br/>ing it, but the commandment, is deci
                    <br/>ded, all would be unhinged, if it were 
                    <br/>not, it is doubtful in its application
                    <br/>to one case only, namely to self defence.
                    <br/>But here are not yet more difficulties. for the
                    <br/>inquiry is suggested, shall we except in the
                    <br/>case of national as well as in that of per
                    <br/>sonal defence, and if we do so, the pre
                    <br/>cept becomes exceedingly limited. as it is dif‐
                    <br/>ficult to distinguish between purely defensive
                    <br/>or partly offensive war. Indeed it is easy to
                    <br/>satisfy ourselves that we are acting on pe
                    <br/>rsonal self defence, when we are not so,
                    <br/>and much more, much easier, to persuade
                    <br/>ourselves and decieve ourselves, as 
                    <br/>to defensive war.If therefore, under our 
                    <br/>economy, we except atall, we are immed
                    <br/>iately involved in difficulties. But, with the 
                    <br/>Jews, this was provided for. There were
                    <br/>cities of refuge for the person who had
                    <br/>killed in self defence, and their battles.
                    <br/>were always under oracular direction. But
                    <br/>as exceptions in certain cases have been made
                    <br/>under such direction, we now make such
                    <br/>exceptions generally, on the principle that
                    <br/>what is right in one case, cannot be
                    <br/>wrong in another. But the case is not
                    <br/>parallel, as it would be if <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> were spe
                    <br/>cifically to guide everything at present
                    <br/>and to place himself at the head of all

               <br/>our affairs, We cannot take advantage
                    <br/>of these exceptions, for they were made under
                    <br/>peculiar auspices, and in peculiar circumߚ
                    <br/>stances, we know not whether in our case,
                    <br/>they would be admitted, we ought to think
                    <br/>that as they are contrary to this com‐
                    <br/>mandment they would not be so, our 
                    <br/>business is to obey the commandment
                    <br/>just as it is given us, and not to look
                    <br/>our for exceptions.</div> 
            
            <div class="p">But it may be said that it would
                    <br/>be impossible to preserve any people, if 
                    <br/>they were not to act on the general pri

                    <br/>they were defended by miracles, which
                    <br/>do not belong to the present economy
                    <br/>of the earth. Now we have seen that
                    <br/>we must not refer to the Jews as an
                    <br/>example, we must take the laws in a
                    <br/>general sense as they were addressed to 
                    <br/>the whole of mankind, except where 
                    <br/>the deity himself has made exceptions 
                    <br/>We must remember that whatever laws
                    <br/>were addresed to <span class="persName-NOAH">Noah</span>, when he came
                    <br/>out of the ark, which were not after
                    <br/>wards abrogated, were addressed to the 
                    <br/>father the future father of all mankind
                    <br/>and were therefore, as well as the code
                    <br/>of commandments delivered on <span class="placeName-SINAI">Sinai</span>
               <br/>to be rules for the future conduct of all
                    <br/>mankind. Now, in the sixth verse of 
                    <br/>the 9th chapter of <span class="title-scripture-GENESIS">Genesis</span>, we find the word.
                    <br/>Whoso sheddith mans blood, by man
                    <br/>shall his blood be shed. This is decis‐
                    <br/>ive, the highest possible penalty is attach
                    <br/>ed to murder under any circumstances.
                    <br/>This authority dissipates all difficul‐
                    <br/>ties that can be started, for all such
                    <br/>difficulties are founded on the supposi‐
                    <br/>tion that we may take the management
                    <br/>of affairs into our own hands.—With
                    <br/>regard to the principle of defensive was
                    <br/>it is still less doubtful. I might notice
                    <br/>the example presented us in the 14 chapter.

            <div class="p">In verse 14 we have another precept of

                    <br/>to any economy. although so frequently

                    <br/>would be like endeavouring to shut up the

                    <br/>hallowing influence. for the passions given
                    <br/>were intended to work, and to work pow
                    <br/>erfully, and our inquiry must be, not
                    <br/>whether they are to be indulged, but in
                    <br/>what way they are to be indulged. We,

                    <br/>escape from committing crime in the heart.
                    <br/>In the 15 verse we find a prohibition of the 
                    <br/>appropriation of property, without the 
                    <br/>consent of the individual possessing it. Now
                    <br/>stealing in the plain and ordinary accep

                    <br/>all our senses recoil at once, but they do
                    <br/>not so, from the possession of property by 
                    <br/>unfair means by any. even the slightest
                    <br/>deviation from fair and honest principles
                    <br/>which is equally an act of theft. In a com
