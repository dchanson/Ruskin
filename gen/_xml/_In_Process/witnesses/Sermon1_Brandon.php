            <div class="p">24 Verse.III. Our attention is to be called today
                    <br/>to the early history of sin, when first intro-
                    <br/>duced into the world. Had no provisions 
                    <br/>been made againt it, we should not now 
                    <br/>have been suprised to find it previal-
                    <br/>ing, for iniquity, when once established, grows 
                    <br/>mightier, and mightier by time[.] But it is 
                    <br/>certaintly more remarkable that sin should 
                    <br/>prevail, when in the 15, and 24 verses,  we have 
                    <br/>a distinct account of the numerous provisions 
                    <br/>which <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> hath made agaisnt it. There is,
                    <br/>in the 15 verse, a promise a certain promise held 
                    <br/>out to us, of a means of attainting, in this this our fallen   
               <br/>a degree of happiness, superior even to our former glory  
                    <br/>through this victory over the serpent, to be obtained  
                    <br/>by the seed of the woman. Again, in the 24th 
                    <br/>verse. There have been many  disputes, con 
                    <br/>ceremonial woship or  as symbolizing the pow'rs and attributes of the
                    <br/>cerning  the nature of Cherubims ‸<div 
              class="add-above" 
              style="left:12.8em">as here mentioned</div> but I rather  
                    <br/>think the most correct opinion is, that they are 
                    <br/>connected with visions, or ceremonial worship 
               <br/>or as symbolizing the pow'rs and attributes of 
                    <br/>the <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> of heaven, and are never used either
                    <br/>for  angels,  as some think, or for 
                    <br/>any kind of living and material beings[.] And 
                    <br/>I think that this opinion is supported by 
                    <br/>numerous texts, as that one. He rode upon a 
                    <br/>cherub, and did fly, yea, he did fly upon the 
                    <br/>wings of the wind; in which I think that 
                    <br/><span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> is intended to be represented as accom-
                    <br/>panied by his pow'r and divine attribrutes, 
                    <br/>and certainly not literally riding upon any kind
                    <br/>of . Now we consider that these
                    <br/>, as sybmolizing or connected with
                    <br/>ceremonial worship, were set up at the east of  
                    <br/>the Garden of Eden, to furnish man with some
                    <br/>rallying  to worhsip to, some mode of
                    <br/>still enjoying a degree of communion with his 
                    <br/>maker[.] We read also that was a flaming sword, 
                    <br/>at the east of the <span class="placeName-fictional-GARDENOFEDEN">Garden</span>, to keep the way of the
                    <br/>tree of life[.] Some think that this flaming sword 
                    <br/>was in the hands of angels, but it  is far more 
                    <br/>probable that it was not so, that it was a

               <br/>flame folding upon itself, entirely distinct from 
                    <br/>the cherubims, and for another purpose, namely 
                    <br/>take away from man all hope of again entering
                    <br/>the garden of <span class="placeName-fictional-GARDENOFEDEN">Eden</span>, or of being restored to his former
                    <br/>condition, and therefore to have recourse to the only 
                    <br/>mode ‸<div 
              class="add-above" 
              style="left:2.4em">of salvation</div> now held out to him, faith in the promises 
                    <br/>of the victory of the future seed of the woman.-  
                    <br/>We find in all these circumstances the strongest- 
                    <br/>possible counteraction of sin[.]  Man can at all-
                    <br/>times enter into the presence of his <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span>, can-
                    <br/>have communion with him, can worship to-
                    <br/>ward him.  How then can sin so prevail[.] Let- 
                    <br/>us consider its various stages, as exemplified in the- 
                    <br/>history of <span class="persName-CAIN">Cain</span> and <span class="persName-ABEL">Abel</span>.  It began first by- 
                    <br/><span class="persName-CAIN">Cain</span>'s utter contempt of these ord{i}nances of <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span>
               <br/>Some say, that as <span class="persName-CAIN">Cain</span> was a tiller of the ground, 
                    <br/>and <span class="persName-ABEL">Abel</span> a keeper of sheep, the offering which each 
                    <br/>brought, namely <span class="persName-CAIN">Cain</span> of the fruits of his husband-
                    <br/>ry, and <span class="persName-ABEL">Abel</span> of the firstlings of his flock, befitt[ed] 
                    <br/>the occupation of each[.]  But it was 
                    <br/>not so[.]  Sheep were not then, as now, kept 
                    <br/>for meat, but for Sacrifice only, for publick, 
                    <br/>sacrifice, and <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> had ordained that the offer-
                    <br/>ing of every one should be the same, therefore
                    <br/><span class="persName-CAIN">Cain</span> did not well, in bringing of the first
                    <br/>fruits of the land, and he offered not by faith  
                    <br/>There have been doubts concerning the mode by
                    <br/>which <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> expressed his respect or disrespect
                    <br/>to the offerings of <span class="persName-CAIN">Cain</span> and Abel, but we know 
                    <br/>that it was a certain one, and it is most 
                    <br/>probable it was that employed in many  
                    <br/>other instances, Fire[.]  It was employed in the 
                    <br/>case of <span class="persName-GIDEON">Gideon</span>, of <span class="persName-MANOAH">Manoah</span>, of <span class="persName-SOLOMON">Solomon</span>, in 
               <br/>that notable case of <span class="persName-ELIJAH">Elijah</span>,  and most likely  
                    <br/>here.  Now when cains offering was not accep-
                    <br/>ted, his contempt of <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> increased into enmity
                    <br/>against man, then followed the murder of his 
                    <br/>brother, and his consequent expulsion from the  
                    <br/>presence of <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span>[.]  Now as <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> is omnipresent,
                    <br/>how could <span class="persName-CAIN">Cain</span> be driven from his presence,  
                    <br/>unless there were some particular place appointed  
                    <br/>by <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> for his worship and from which <span class="persName-CAIN">Cain</span>
               <br/>was expelled.  Nevertheless, <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> determines to
                    <br/>preserve him, notwithstanding his wickidness
                    <div id="296805v_0003" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>and therefore he sets a mark upon him, or as I 
                    <br/>think the expression rather means shows him a  
                    <br/>miracle, to convince him, that he should not  
                    <br/>be the subject of common enmity. The ‸<div 
              class="add-above" 
              style="left:15.2em">other</div> sons 
                    <br/>of <span class="persName-ADAM">Adam</span>, are now called the sons of <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> or the
                    <br/>church, while those of <span class="persName-CAIN">Cain</span> are called the sons of  
                    <br/>men, or the world. <span class="persName-CAIN">Cain</span>'s Children were the 
               <br/>authors of the arts and amusements, in order to 
                    <br/>dispel that gloom with which they were impress'd  
                    <br/>and therefore whatever uses these arts may be 
                    <br/>applied to at present, we have no rea-
                    <br/>son to be proud of their origin.  For we read  
                    <br/>that <span class="persName-CAIN">Cain</span> had two wives, the name of the one  
                    <br/>was <span class="persName-ADAH">Adah</span>, and the name of the other <span class="persName-ZILLAH">Zillah</span>[.]  
                    <br/>And <span class="persName-ADAH">Adah</span> bare <span class="persName-JABAL">Jabal</span>, he was the father of such  
                    <br/>as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle  
               <br/>Now we may ask how Jabal, was distinguished 
                    <br/>from the other sons of Adam, for they both 
                    <br/>were keepers the of sheep or of cattle[.]  But 
                    <br/>Cains progeny are supposed to have been 
                    <br/>first who ever used animal food; in direct  
                    <br/>opposition to the Ordinances of <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span>, and thus
                    <br/>Jabal was a keeper of Sheep and cattle for 
                    <br/>food, <span class="persName-Abel">Abel</span> only for Sacrifice.  We have thus 
                    <br/>seen, that the progeny of <span class="persName-CAIN">Cain</span> personate 
                    <br/>the world, and that of <span class="persName-SETH">Seth</span>, the Church, 
                    <br/>and had this distinction not been broken  
                    <br/>through, there might never have been a deluge.  
                    <br/>But we read in the 2nd verse of the sixth chap-
                    <br/>ter, that the sons of <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span>, (the church,) saw the
                    <br/>daughters of men, (the world) that they were fair 
                    <br/>and they took them wives of all whom they
                    <br/>chose.  They were thus blended together, with  
                    <br/>the approbation, it may be supposed, of the great-
                    <br/>er part of the sons of <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span>, then we read, that
                    <br/>their progeny were giants, men 
                    <br/>of renown, who acquired renown by oppressing 
                    <br/>each other, thus entered violence, the wicked-
                    <br/>ness of men became great in the earth, and 
                    <br/>then came the deluge.  We may 
                    <br/>now derive some general inferences, from these  observa 
                    <br/>tions on the state of the world before the flood. 
                    <br/>We see, that in the midst of mans deepest 
                    <br/>demerit, <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> was a God of mercy and Condes
                    <br/>cension Instead of visiting mans transgressions
                    <div id="296805v_0004" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>upon him, <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> gives him a sanctuary, a place
                    <br/>to worship in, and a sacrifice.  And we have in 
                    <br/>this a clear view of what <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> is to us at present
                    <br/>He has provided for us a place wherein  to 
                    <br/>worship the God of our fathers, and he was also
                    <br/>provided a sacrifice for us, his son, <span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Jesus</span>.  He  
                    <br/>demands from us now the same purity of soul, and 
                    <br/>devotedness of spirit which he demanded then[.]
                    <br/>But although we find <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span> kind and forgiving
                    <br/>he is also a God of Justice, and will not   
                    <br/>overlook obstinate transgression He suffered 
                    <br/>long with <span class="persName-CAIN">Cain</span>, then took exemplary vengeance,  
                    <br/>and cast him forth of his presence.  We are 
                    <br/>exposed to a corresponding punishment, for 
                    <br/>we insult the same <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span>, and unless we cast
                    <br/>off our dead works, and turn in time, we are 
                    <br/>only laying up wrath against the day of wrath 
                    <br/>and the indignation and punishment so  
                    <br/>dreadfully put forth against <span class="persName-CAIN">Cain</span>, is 
                    <br/>what we also must expect, & endure.</div>
            <br/>
            <div class="p">We see from hence the vast importance 
                    <br/>of personal decision. There were, before the
                    <br/>flood, two companies, the children of <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span>,
                    <br/>and the children of men  While the children 
                    <br/>of <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span>, or the church, held fast this personal
                    <br/>decision they were safe, but when that gave 
                    <br/>way, the two companies united, the barrier 
                    <br/>was broken down, and they were destroyed
                    <br/>together.</div>
            <br/>
            <div class="p">If we would be found the followers of <span class="persName-fictional-GOD">God</span>
               <br/>we must never yield to the world, even in

                    <br/>to us  now, that he did to one of his people
                    <br/>then, whom he preserved and sustained,
