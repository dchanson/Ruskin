            <span class="head-chapter" id="">The law of sacrifice.</span>
            
            <div class="p">The 1st chapter of <span class="title-scripture-LEVITICUS">Leviticus</span>, from the
                    <br/>beginning.  I think that in the re‐
                    <br/>marks on the law of <span class="persName-MOSES">Moses</span>; which
                    <br/>are to employ us to obey., it is better to
                    <br/>enter upon <span class="title-scripture-LEVITICUS">Leviticus</span>, as the book which
                    <br/>contains more specifically the details
                    <br/>of the law of sacrifice, which is the
                    <br/>very foundation of the Mosaic econ
                    <br/>omy.  We shall first <span class="del-strikethrough">fir</span> consider
                    <br/>the doctrine of atonement here, & then
                    <br/>follow it up to its antitype, the death
                    <br/>of <span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span>.  Now this is a real form 
                    <br/>of sacrifice, and a simple form.  It is
                    <br/>not for a confimation of testimony
                    <br/>nor announcement, nor instruction
                    <div id="MS Sermon 005a" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>to be communicated.  The priest takes the
                    <br/>sacrifice in silence, in the open court before
                    <br/>the tabernacle, where the altar for sac
                    <br/>rifice was placed. he slays and sprin
                    <br/>kles the blood round about upon the
                    <br/>altar.  Now there is nothing here, that
                    <br/>would lead us to infer any thing
                    <br/>more, than a simple form of sac‐
                    <br/>rifice.  But. in the 4 verse, we are in
                    <br/>formed, that the man laid his hand
                    <br/>on the head of the burntoffering and
                    <br/>it was accepted for him to make
                    <br/>atonement for him.  Now, nothing can
                    <br/>be more clear, than that we have here
                    <br/>a sinner laying his hand on the head of
                    <br/>the sacrifice, in order to communicate
                    <br/>the load of his sins and his wickedness
                    <br/>to the animal  The victim was then
                    <br/>substituted for him, it bore his punish
                    <br/>ment, and was accepted for him
                    <br/>to make atonement for him.  Can
                    <br/>anything be clearer, than that this
                    <br/>was merely a scene of sacrifice and of
                    <br/>atonement.</div>
            <br/>
            <div class="p">But we have also another intimat‐
                    <br/>tion.  The sacrifice must be appropri‐
                    <br/>ate.  Every victim or any victim that
                    <br/>the man might choose to give, would
                    <br/>not suffice.  It must be pure, chosen
                    <br/>out of the flock, a male without ble
                    <br/>mish, or it will not be accepted
                    <br/>And the last intimation is, that the
                    <br/>sacrifice must be offered, of the mans
                    <br/>own voluntary will.  There was no le‐
                    <br/>gal authority that could compel the
                    <br/>man to bring the sacrifice, he was only
                    <br/>in case that he withheld it debarred
                    <br/>from certain religious privileges, which
                    <br/>were withheld by <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> from him who
                    <br/>sacrificed not, but he was compelled
                    <br/>to sacrifice no farther than by being
                    <br/>threatened with <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>s high displeas‐
                    <br/>ure, if he refused.  It is through
                    <br/>these three points that I wish to fol‐
                    <br/>low up the shadow of sacrifice to its 
                    <br/>substance, <span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span>.</div>
            <br/>
            <div class="p">For. the law was raised up, in order
                    <br/>to throw forward a shadow to another
                    <br/>economy which other economy, was,
                    <br/>we see shadowed forth by sacrifice &
                    <br/>this is explained in the beginning of the
                    <br/>10<sup>th</sup> chapter, of <span class="title-scripture-HEBREWS">Hebrews</span>, where it is said
                    <br/>that the law, having a shadow of good
                    <br/>things to come and not the very image
                    <br/>of those things, can never with sacrifi
                    <br/>ces, make the comers thereunto perfect &
                    <br/>and it goes on to say that the blood of
                    <br/>it goes on to say that the blood of
                    <br/>bulls and goats can never take away <div 
              class="add-below" 
              style="left:11.6em">(sin</div></div>
            <div id="MS Sermon 006a" class="pb"></div>
            <br/>
            <div class="p">Now, if it is impossible, that blood can
                    <br/>take away sin, can we suppose, that
                    <br/>these momentous ordinances, were on
                    <br/>ly for show, for ceremony,  Can <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> in
                    <br/>stitute any thing of no moral worth
                    <br/>certainly not.  Then as the law threw
                    <br/>forward a shadow to another economy
                    <br/>these sacrifices must be to intimate
                    <br/>that sacrifice is necessary in the other
                    <br/>economy and sacrifice, which shall
                    <br/>be capable of taking away all sin.  Now
                    <br/>if in the <span class="title-scripture-GOSPEL">Gospel</span> this sacrifice of anim
               <br/>is done away with, and yet we know
                    <br/>that we must have sacrifices of some
                    <br/>sort, we are shut up to the death of
                    <br/><span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span>, as the very essence of atonemen
               <br/>The law sacrifices derived their value
                    <br/>only because they referred to the gos
                    <br/>pel and if this be correct, the view
                    <br/>which we have taked of them, must be referred to <span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span>.</div>
            <br/>
            <div class="p">In the first place, <span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span> has some
                    <br/>times been erroneously held up, as a
                    <br/>mere martyr to truth, and it has
                    <br/>been affirmed, that he died only to
                    <br/>confirm the truth of his tetimonies
                    <br/>and not to take away our sin.  Bu
               <br/>he confirmed the truth of his testimony
                    <br/>by miracles, not by his death, he died
                    <br/>as a sacrifice, for his death alone could
                    <br/>not have confirmed <span class="del-strikethrough">the</span> his truth
                    <br/>Pagans have died for their religion
                    <br/>yet that does not prove the truth
                    <br/>of Pagnism.  Mahametans have died
                    <br/>for their religion yet that does
                    <br/>not prove the truth of Moham‐
                    <br/>medanism.  Atheists have died for
                    <br/>their no religion, yet that does not
                    <br/>prove that  there is no <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>.  Their
                    <br/>death proves only thier attachment
                    <br/>to their system, not the truth of that
                    <br/>system.  The word of <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> in no place
                    <br/>brings forward the death of <span class="persName-STEPHEN">Stephen</span>
               <br/>as an evidence of the truth of Chris‐
                    <br/>tianity.  The death of <span class="del-strikethrough">Stephe</span> <span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span>
               <br/>must then be regarded, not as a
                    <br/>confirmation of his testimony, but as
                    <br/>a sacrifice for the ungodly.</div>
            <br/>
            <div class="p">Again, as the law is a shadow of
                    <br/>good things to come, and as sacrifice
                    <br/>is the foundation of the law we have
                    <br/>a stiking proof of the efficacy of the
                    <br/>atonement of<span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span>.  Now the victim
                        
               <br/>to be presented in the old law, was
                    <br/>to be appropriate, and we find that
                    <div id="MS Sermon 006a" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>the <span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Saviour</span> was thus fitting for the a
                    <br/>tonement he had to make.  He had
                    <br/>to take upon himself the burde of the
                    <br/>world, and he was able to do so, he had
                    <br/>to take away moral guilts, which no cre
               <br/>ture could do, and a creature victim
                    <br/>would therefore have been rejected; he
                    <br/>was able to do this also.  We should re
                    <br/>member that when we wish to offer
                    <br/>to the <span class="persName-GOD">Almighty</span> a sacrifice for our
                    <br/>sins, we have to consider of what value
                    <br/>the victim will appear to his eyes.  Now
                    <br/>could any creature have value in the
                    <br/>sight of the <span class="persName-GOD">Almighty</span>.  Are not the
                    <br/>highest of them the mere result of
                    <br/>his fiat, from the least even unto
                    <br/>the greatest of them they requite the
                    <br/>same effort of powe to create them;
                    <br/>the crawling reptile, and the most ex
                    <br/>alted archangel, are equally valueless
                    <br/>as a sacrifice in the sight of <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, bec
                    <br/>ause he could speak a world of such
                    <br/>beings into existence in a moment.  All
                    <br/>things are valued by their scarcity &
                    <br/>there is no value whatever attached to
                    <br/>that which is in rich abundance‐
                    <br/>gold is valued because it is scarce, but the
                    <br/>rock in which it is found is not
                    <br/>valued, because it is plentiful.  As <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>
               <br/>therefore can call every creature inߚ
                    <br/>to existence with equal facility no crea
                    <br/>ture can be of value in his eyes and
                    <br/>we are compelled to seek a sacrifice
                    <br/>beyond creatures, which sacrifice must
                    <br/>be <span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span>.  And his death could not
                    <br/>be held up, unless he were the son of
                    <br/><span class="persName-GOD">God</span>  He must be <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, or he could not
                    <br/>meet the character of the dispensation
                    <br/>There is likewise another characteristic
                    <br/>the man must do it of his own free
                    <br/>will, and this finally gives us the whole
                    <br/>character of the new testament dispen
                    <br/>sation.  For the sacrifice of <span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span> is
                    <br/>not one to which authority can press
                    <br/>us, nor with which we can be com
                    <br/>pelled to connect ourselves.  We must
                    <br/>have our mind enlightened by the
                    <br/>demonstrations of the spirit and the po‐
                    <br/>wer of <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>.  There must be enlighten‐
                    <br/>ing, before we can lay hold on the sac
                    <br/>rifice of <span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span>.  Now the next question
                    <br/>which must necessarily occur to us,
                    <br/>is, have we done this, and have we done
                    <br/>it of our free will  For it will not
                    <br/>suffice if we have only been induced to
                    <div id="MS Sermon 007a" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>confess <span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span> by the influence of our
                    <br/>relations, Influence, or custom are not
                    <br/>our own free will.  And unless we are
                    <br/>found voluntarily resting on the new tes
                    <br/>timent atonement, we are as guilty as
                    <br/><span class="persName-NADAB">Nadab</span> and <span class="persName-ABIHU">Abihu</span>, we offer strange fire be
                    <br/>fore the <span class="persName-GOD">Lord</span> and we must take heed,
                    <br/>lest their punishment should also light
                    <br/>upon us.  we are as much guilty of us
               <br/>ery of the <span class="persName-GOD">Lord</span>, as that man would have
                    <br/>been, who should have brought the vic
                    <br/>tim to <span class="persName-MOSES">Moses</span>, not of his own free will.
                    <br/>Now, is not this a solemn thing, to lay
                    <br/>our hand on the sacrifice of <span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span> which
                    <br/>if we do of our own free will, we shall
                    <br/>be found in the presence of <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> accep‐
                    <br/>ting the offering which he has valued
                    <br/>because it was not that of a creature
                    <br/>he invites us to draw near and rest on
                    <br/>this atonement, the substance of the shad
                    <br/>ow of the Mosaic dispensation, which
                    <br/>if we do we shall be washed from
