            <div class="p">We are now to direct our attention, to a 
                    <br/>few of the principle events, which immed‐
                    <br/>iately followed the deluge. 20, of VIII, to end.
                    <br/>The very first intimation, which we have 
                    <br/>of altars being built unto the <span class="persName-GOD">Lord</span>, is in 
                    <br/>this passage, and we find, that it was 
                    <br/>the very first action of <span class="persName-NOAH">Noah</span>, after he came
                    <br/>out of the ark.  But although this is the 
                    <br/>very first positive intimation, which we 
                    <br/>have, of altars being built unto the <span class="persName-GOD">Lord</span> 
               <br/><span class="del-strikethrough">i</span>there is no ground to believe that the 
                    <br/>descendants of <span class="persName-SETH">Seth</span>, built no altars.  Nay 
                    <br/>we have great reason to believe that al‐
                    <br/>tars were used, as we are told that they 
                    <br/>offered sacrifices.  We may infer, from
                    <br/>this, the first action of <span class="persName-NOAH">Noah</span>, two things,
                    <br/>his gratitude, and his obedience.  His grat‐
                    <br/>itude at once led him to build the altar,
                    <br/>his obedience to the previous ordinances 
                    <br/>of <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> made him bring the animals to be
                    <br/>sacrificed thereon.  He might well indeed 
                    <br/>be grateful, for the merciful preservation
                    <br/>which had been extended to him.  And we 
                    <br/>thus find that <span class="persName-NOAH">Noah</span>s very first action
                    <br/>symbolized the atonement of <span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span>.
                    <br/>We now find the acceptance of <span class="persName-NOAH">Noah</span>s offe
                    <br/>ring announced to us.  We are told.  The 
                    <br/><span class="persName-GOD">Lord</span> smelled a sweet savour, and the <span class="persName-GOD">Lord</span> 
               <br/>said in his heart.  I will not again
                    <br/>curse the ground any more for mans sake
                    <br/>for the imagination of mans heart is 
                    <br/>evil continually.  The reason here is re‐
                    <br/>markable[.]  The heart of man is so 
                    <div id="296805v_0012" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>entirely evil from his youth, so utterly deprav
                    <br/>ed and corrupted, that no expression whate
                    <br/>ver of divine vengeance, would ever restrain 
                    <br/>it, and it would be entirely useless continual
                    <br/>ly to destroy the race of mankind.  But then 
                    <br/>it may be objected, why did the flood come 
                    <br/>at all[.]  Why was this terrible judgement 
                    <br/>executed against mankind, if it was not 
                    <br/>to have the least effect upon them.  It is 
                    <br/>remarkable, that the same <span class="del-strikethrough">event</span>reason s
                    <br/>should be given, both for causing the flood
                    <br/>and afterwards witholding a repetition of 
                    <br/>it.  Now the deluge was not a trial of
                    <br/>men, to see whether any judgement or pun
                    <br/>ishment would have any effect in causing
                    <br/>their amendment, it was not an experim
                    <br/>ment of which <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> did not know the result
                    <br/>but it was to show, the utter hopelessness 
                    <br/>of reclaiming the children of men, in any 
                    <br/>other manner, than by their being born a
                    <br/>again in <span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span>.  There was therefore good 
                    <br/>reason, both for causing the deluge, and for 
                    <br/>preventing its repetition.  The next circum
                    <br/>stance which is to be noticed, is the grant 
                    <br/>of animal food which <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> made to man 
                    <br/>at this period.  There was no grant be
                    <br/>fore made to man, of any thing for food 
                    <br/>but the products of the vegetable kingdom  
                    <br/>Still we have reason to suppose that animal 
                    <br/>food was used before the flood, for all <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>s 
                    <br/>ordinances were utterly neglected and despised
                    <br/>by the sons of <span class="persName-CAIN">Cain</span>[,] but we may infer<span class="del-strikethrough">e</span>,
                    <br/>from the grant now made of animal food,
                    <br/>that the sons of <span class="persName-SETH">Seth</span>, or at least, <span class="persName-NOAH">Noah</span>, & 
                    <br/>his family, abstained from it and held the 
                    <br/>divine command in veneration.  But, it may 
                    <br/>be asked, why was that granted now, which
                    <br/>was denied before.  It should be remembered
                    <br/>that the vegetable kingdom must have 
                    <br/>been partially destroyed, or at least mater
                    <br/>ially injured, by the operation of the flood, 
                    <br/>and for some time, vegetables must have 
                    <br/>been entirely inadequate, for the sustenance 
                    <br/>of mankind.  Therefore the means of his sup
                    <br/>port are now enlarged, but at the same 
                    <br/>time, all cruelty, which might have been 
                    <div id="296805v_0013" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>consequent upon the introduction of animal 
                    <br/>food, was forbidden by the following precept
                    <br/>Verse 4.9. flesh with the life thereof which is 
                    <br/>the blood thereof, shall ye not eat  The next
                    <br/>circumstance to which our attention is to be 
                    <br/>directed, is the enforcement of capital pun
                    <br/>ishment  Whoso sheddeth mans blood, by man
               <br/>shall his blood be shed, and the reason assig‐
                    <br/>ned, is the dignity of man, “for in the image 
                    <br/>of <span class="persName-GOD">God</span><span class="del-strikethrough">e</span> made he him, but this punishment 
                    <br/>was entirely confided to murder.  Some say 
                    <br/>that this law, was confined to the economy 
                    <br/>of <span class="persName-MOSES">Moses</span>, but it is, I think, not so.  It was 
                    <br/>given as the law of the new world, and 
                    <br/>was intended to go down to the latest
                    <br/>generations  <span class="persName-NOAH">Noah</span> is here the father of the 
                    <br/>world, and this is the foundation of the 
                    <br/>criminal law, throughout all the after‐
                    <br/>world.  This severe law against murder was 
                    <br/>rend{e}red necessary by the state of violence 
                    <br/>which we are told prevailed before the
                    <br/>flood and in which it is probable that mur
                    <br/>der was no uncommon circumstance[,] and 
                    <br/>no ordinance atall less severe than the one 
                    <br/>under consideration, would have had the 
                    <br/>least effect in its prevention.</div>
            <br/>
            <div class="p">We now pass on, to the token which is 
                    <br/>given by <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, of the faithfulness of the 
                    <br/>covenant which he made, not to des‐
                    <br/>troy mankind again.  It has been said 
                    <br/>that as physical nature is such, as, with
                    <br/>out the intervention of any miracle, to 
                    <br/>produce the rainbow, by the refraction of 
                    <br/>the suns rays in the drops of falling rain, 
                    <br/>the bow must either not have been a to‐
                    <br/>ken to mankind, given at this time, or 
                    <br/>else, that there could have been no 
                    <br/>rain upon the earth before the flood.
                    <br/>For this last hypothesis, we have, on the 
                    <br/>contrary, ample reason to believe that
                    <br/>there was rain.  5 and 6[,] of II  But there 
                    <br/>went up a mist from the earth and wa

                    <br/>the <span class="persName-GOD">Lord</span> had not yet caused it to rain
                    <br/>upon the earth from which we may in
                    <br/>fer, that rain followed immediately[,] &
                    <br/>for the first, this is no proof that the 
                    <br/>rainbow was not a token given by <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, 
                    <div id="296805v_0014" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>We should rather say that <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> selected an 
                    <br/>object well known, and of frequent recur‐
                    <br/>rence in the common course of nature 
                    <br/>as a token which would constantly be in 
                    <br/>view, of the faithfulness of his covenant[,] & 
                    <br/>which was quite sufficient.  After this, 
                    <br/>we find the whole human race, having 
                    <br/>collected themselves into one community[,] a
                    <br/>bout to enter into a scheme of pride and 
                    <br/>wickedness, which clearly shows how soon
                    <br/>the depravity incident to man had ag
                    <br/>ain taken root among the progeny of
                    <br/><span class="persName-NOAH">Noah</span>.  This is the first public step of 
                    <br/>any consequence in which they general
                    <br/>ly concurred; and this is one, which di
                    <br/>rectly sets forth their spirit of pride  
                    <br/>We read, that they found a plain in 
                    <br/>the land of <span class="placeName-SHINAR">Shinar</span>, and they said [one] to 
               <br/>another, Go to, let us build a city and 
                    <br/>tower whose top may reach unto heaven 
                    <br/>and they had brick for stone, and slime 
                    <br/>had they for mortar.  Now, this tower
                    <br/>was certainly not built for the purpose 
                    <br/>of affording them an asylum from a 
                    <br/>second deluge, which they  might have 
                    <br/>supposed to be impending, for we read
                    <br/>that the tower was built in a plain, & 
                    <br/>it is certain, that the very highest e‐
                    <br/>minences would have been selected for 
                    <br/>its foundation, had it been intended for 
                    <br/>this purpose, for no tower that they 
                    <br/>could build, would ever have attained 
                    <br/>the elevation of the circumjacent moun
                    <br/>tains, and again, it could not be to 
                    <br/>prevent their threatenʼd dispersion through 
                    <br/>the earth, for that was inevitable, as 
                    <br/>such numbers could never dwell togeth
                    <br/>er, as well on the account of scarcity of 
                    <br/>food, as for various other causes.  No, it 
                    <br/>was to make them a name, to raise 
                    <br/>a mon[u]ment to themselves, before their 
                    <br/>necessary dispersion.  They built no al
                    <br/>tars to their <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, to testify their
                    <div id="296805v_0015" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>gratitude to him, they brought no sac
                    <br/>rifices, to testify their expectation of the 
                    <br/>coming of a Saviour.  No— every motive, 
                    <br/>was lost in one which was pride, and that 
                    <br/>in its most extravagant form.  They a{p}
                    <br/>pear to have forgotten the existence of a 
                    <br/><span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, and th[is] was a mere monument 
                    <br/>to themselves, which they intended to 
                    <br/>make them a name, that is, to per
                    <br/>petuate their memory and fame to the 
                    <br/>latest posterity showing how far sin,
                    <br/>had, at this period, again found its 
                    <br/>way among men.  But this undertak
                    <br/>ing, which was begun to perpetuate their 
                    <br/>fame, did only in the end perpetuate thier 
                    <br/>shame for <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> caused it to be given up, <span class="del-strikethrough">and</span>
               <br/>their dispersion was effected so much the soon
                    <br/>er, and in order to effect it the more com
                    <br/>pletely, <span class="persName-GOD">GOD</span> caused the confusion of tongues,
                    <br/>which, besides scattering them abroad in
                    <br/>to all countries, was in itself a severe
                    <br/>punishment, and remains so to the pres
                    <br/>ent day.  For, even now, infinite evil and 
                    <br/>difficulty arises from the variety of langua
                    <br/>ges spoken in different parts of the globe[.]  
                    <br/>Much time is wasted, and much talent 
                    <br/>is lost or dissipated by many students, be

                    <br/>overcome[.]  And if we consider, what the 
                    <br/>time thus wasted, and the talent thus 
                    <br/>lost, might have effected, had they been 
                    <br/>applied to any useful or beneficial purpose, 
                    <br/>we cannot but acknowledge, that the con
                    <br/>fusion of tongues, was, and is, a very se
                    <br/>vere punishment.</div>
            <br/>
            <div class="p">Yet, as we uniformly find it, this judgment 
                    <br/>is mingled with mercy.  Supposing, 
                    <br/>that the children of men had concluded
                    <br/>their impious undertaking, and had built
                    <br/>their city, and their tower.  The necessity 
                    <br/>that they should separate, would, very 
                    <br/>soon, have become pressing[.]  And would 
                    <br/>not dreadful contests have taken place 
                    <br/>among a multitude so hardened, & 
                    <br/>who had entirely forgotten, or despised 
                    <br/>the commandments and ordinances of <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>{'s}
                    <br/>contests, as to who should quit the part,
                    <br/>the very small part, of the world already
                    <br/>known, and go out among the bri
                    <br/>ars, and thorns of the wilderness, far 
                    <br/>from all inhabited, or cultivated reg‐{ions} 
               <div id="296805v_0016" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>to build themselves new cities, or find new
                    <br/>pastures[.]  There would have been such com
                    <br/>bats for the regions already known, as would 
                    <br/>almost have exterminated the race of man 
                    <br/>as effectually as did the deluge[.]  All this 
                    <br/>violence and bloodshed however, is preven
                    <br/>ted by the confusion of tongues, which scat
                    <br/>tered them at once, saving them and pun
                    <br/>ishing them at the same time[.]</div>
            <br/>
            <div class="p">In spite of this however, we find, after 
                    <br/>their dispersion, the viol{e}nce which preceded
                    <br/>the flood again commencing[.]  It is said
                    <br/>that <span class="persName-NIMROD">Nimrod</span> was a mighty hunter before 
                    <br/>the <span class="persName-GOD">Lord</span>.  Now at this period, when ani‐
                    <br/>mals multiplied more than men, it became 
                    <br/>of very great consequence, that the more 
                    <br/>powerful of them, at least, should be des
                    <br/>troyed.  In consequence, he who excelled in 
                    <br/>this department would obtain a leadership 
                    <br/>and authority over his fellow, which after‐
                    <br/>wards readily he turned to his own aggran
                    <br/>dizement.  The hunting of <span class="persName-NIMROD">Nimrod</span>, is, on 
                    <br/>this account, celibrated, and we can have 
                    <br/>no doubt, that he afterwards took advan
                    <br/>tage of <span class="del-strikethrough">this</span> the authority[,] thus obtained,
                    <br/>to raise himself to the power and dignity 
               <br/>of a monarch, or a tyrant.  I am not speak
                    <br/>ing just now against monarchy  That is 
                    <br/>an institution which I consider to have been 
                    <br/>ordained by <span class="persName-GOD">God</span>, and which therefore should 
                    <br/>be honoured by men, and only evil in its 
                    <br/>origin.  Again[,] it may be supposed, that 
                    <br/>any individual, who, after the dispersion, first
                    <br/>led to the building of towns, or the establish
                    <br/>ment of Colonies, would in the first case,
                    <br/>be looked up to with respect, or even vene‐
                    <br/>ration, which would increase, until, after 
                    <br/>his death, he might be ranked as a minor 
                    <br/>divinity[.]  The number of these divinities would 
                    <br/>be gradually increased, and their actions 
                    <br/>would, in the course of time, be exaggera
                    <br/>ted by tradition, till the true, and only <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> 
               <br/>would be entirely lost, and this was the o
                    <br/>rigin of idolatry.  This was the state of 
                    <br/>abandonment, and idolatry into which the 
                    <br/>earth was plunged, at the period of the cal
                    <br/>ling of <span class="del-strikethrough">Noah</span> <span class="persName-ABRAHAM">Abraham</span></div>
            <br/>
            <div class="p">We shall now proceed to draw a few in
                    <br/>ferences, from the circumstances, which 
                    <div id="296805v_0017" class="pb"></div>
               <br/>we have seen to day to have been those 
                    <br/>of the world immediately after the flood  
                    <br/>I would first notice the desperate and in
                    <br/>curable wickedness of the human heart; I
                    <br/>have often spoken of this before, and I speak
                    <br/>of it again, both because examples of is
               <br/>are constantly introduced throughout the
                    <br/>whole of the sacred writings, and because it
                    <br/> is a circumstance which can
                    <br/><u>not be</u> too often impressed on the mind of
                    <br/>every one.  We see, that as soon as any
                    <br/>individual made himself useful to his fel
                    <br/>low creatures in any one department he
                    <br/>employed those powers which he had thus
                    <br/>obtained, to aggrandize himself, in short
                    <br/>to subjugate, and tyrannize over that
                    <br/>people, for whose benefit he had previous
                    <br/>ly been labouring.  Again, does not
                    <br/>the entire absence of religion, from the
                    <br/>multitude in the plain of <span class="placeName-SHINAR">Shinar</span>, offer
                    <br/>another remarkable example, of this dread
                    <br/>ful depravity[.]  Every thing was lost in
                    <br/>their selfish ness, in their vain glory; in
                    <br/>their pride; <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> was altogether forgotten
                    <br/>and mankind gave a loose rein to their
                    <br/>passions, ending in their own confusion.</div>
            <br/>
            <div class="p">Again, we should learn from this, the
                    <br/>amazing importance of humility.  The fame
                    <br/>of the builders of <span class="placeName-BABEL">Babel</span>, has, through their
                    <br/>pride, been perpetuated, but not in the
                    <br/>manner that they wished, to their glory
                    <br/>and their honour, but to their abasement
                    <br/>and degradation.  Had they been found
                    <br/>worshipping <span class="persName-GOD">God</span> with humility, had they
                    <br/>built altars, and brought sacrifices, it
                    <br/>had then been an everlasting monument
                    <br/>to their glory, and posterity would have
                    <br/>looked back upon their humility, with res
                    <br/>peck, and veneration.  But it was not
                    <br/>so, and their confusion is now an everl‐

                    <br/>cometh before a fall, and of the impor‐
