                   ear, when it was dead to other sound, awoke to the<br/>

                   dark eye rested sadly upon it. She was waiting for a<br/>

                   was the voice of one who loved her with a more than<br/>
                   common love. They had first met when <span class="persName-fictional-GIULIETTA-LEONI">Giulietta</span> was<br/>

                   manhood — from that hour she was the light of his<br/>
                   path, and the joy of his heart. Her father knew<br/>

                   to <span class="persName-fictional-GIULIETTA-LEONI">Giulietta</span> some ancient feud of their families, as an<br/>

                   among the dead, and they found the body of <span class="persName-fictional-GARCIO-LEONI">Garcio</span>,<br/>
                   and the sword of their leader lying beside it; but him<br/>
                   they found not. And they retired, silently, under cover<br/>
                   of the night, to their fastness among the mountains.<br/></div>
         
         
         <div class="p"><span class="space" style="padding-left:0.8em"> </span>O calmly, brightly, beautifully rose the morning<br/>
                   out of the eastern sea, and widely spread the rosy<br/>
                   dawn over the deep! Gloriously the radiance stole up<br/>
                   into the high heaven, where the white clouds waved<br/>
                   their light wings in the deepness of the infinite blue,<br/>
                   and looked out eastward, rejoicing, as they met the<br/>
                   morning breeze that sprang upward from its repose, in<br/>
                   the grove of silver <span class="name--OLIVE">olive</span>s. And the sun lifted his<br/>
                   head majestically out of the sea, and the mists passed<br/>
                   away before his glance, from its surface, and the<br/>
                   waves rolled onward, singing, with sweet low voices,<br/>
                   and a long golden path was thrown upon them, even<br/>
                   unto the shore.<br/></div>
         
         
         <div class="p"><span class="space" style="padding-left:0.8em"> </span>O the radiance of that morning was unconscious of<br/>
                   the desolation of the night! There was no sadness in<br/>
                   the dawn that shone on the ruins of <span class="placeName-fictional-CASTELALTO-LEONI">Castel Alto</span><span class="gloss-inline">

                   surges that, in the night, had dashed away the blood<br/>
                   from the shore, now broke clear and white on the un‐<br/>
                   stained pebbles. A figure was leaning against a rock<br/>
                   on the strand. Few, very few could have recognised,<br/>
                   in the haggard face, and withered form, the once<br/>

                   pacing the shore, with the unequal step, and wild<br/>
                   gestures of a maniac.<br/></div>
