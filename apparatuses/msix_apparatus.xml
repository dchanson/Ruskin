                    <p>On the first leaf following the front flyleaf, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>'s cousin, <persName corresp="#JAS">Joan Severn</persName>, 
                        inscribed &#x201C;<persName corresp="#JAS">Joan R. Severn</persName> / from <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">Di Pa</persName>&#x201D;,  
                        this manuscript being one of the those associated with touring that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> set aside for her (see Introduction. 
                        Opposite this inscription, on the verso of the flyleaf, is inscribed in pencil &#x201C;Mr Ruskin&#x201D; possibly in the hand of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, 
                        followed by a second line in the same hand, which is difficult to decipher, but which contains the numeral "16".</p>

                    <head type="section">Description</head>
                    <p>Ruled notebook; brown marbled boards and endpapers, three-quarter-bound in bluish-green leather; 20.5 × 16.5 cm.</p>
                    <p>Someone--probably <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>--has numbered leaves on their rectos, starting, oddly, with the second leaf following the two front flyleaves; 
                        i.e., the inside first flyleaf has the inscription by (possibl) <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> mentioned above, the second flyleaf has the inscription by <persName corresp="#JAS">Joan Severn</persName> mentioned above, 
                        and then there is another unnumbered leaf before the numbering begins on the following leaf. Despite this irregularity, I employ this numbering for the  Content  below. 
                        In the front of the notebook, eleven leaves (i.e., the first unnumbered leaf following the inscribed flyleaves, plus numbered leaves 1-10) have had their right edges cut away--to 
                        about one cm. deep--but leaving a small tab on the edge of each leaf. On these marginal tabs, someone has printed an alphabet, prepatory for an alphabetical directory of some kind. 
                        These leaves were never used, however, and it is impossible to say whether the alphabetizing was done by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> or by someone who had prepared the notebook before him. 
                        Possibly, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> meant to provide an alphbetized table of contents at the start of his poem. (He did compile an index at the back of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title>, 
                        although that index was probably for his personal use, since <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title> was a rough copy notebook.) As it turned out, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> failed to prepare even a title page for <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>, 
                        and the illustrated poem and prose sequence is untitled.</p>
                    <p>It is also possible that, since <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>’s writing is the first to appear in the manuscript ( Content,  d), she made the alphabetical tabs for some use of her own. 
                        The paper is watermarked  HAGAR &#x0026; CO / <date when="1822">1822</date>,  so the notebook might have lain unused in the household for a long time. What seems least likely is that 
                        someone would have subjected the manuscript to this treatment after <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> used the notebook for his poetry--or, for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>’s part, 
                        that he would have started his project several leaves into the notebook, leaving all those blank leaves to be exploited later.</p>
                    <p>Tipped in at the front, attached to the marbled fly leaf, <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> added a sheet describing <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>. Like his sheets tipped into the front of many Red Books 
                        and other major manuscripts, he pasted onto it a clipping from PJR describing the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>, and commented on any additions or rebinding since <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>’s <date when="1891">1891</date> edition. 
                        In this case, where <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> summarized that  pp. 1-21 are prepared for alphabetical index,  while  pp. 22-23 contain quotations in <persName corresp="#MR">Mrs. J. J. Ruskin</persName>’s handwriting,  
                        and  pp. 25-111, about a third of the book, were filled with prose and verse . . . with inserted drawings --i.e., the so-called <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</title>--<persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> 
                        added the note,  most of the blank pages have since been removed &#x0026; the book replaced in its old cover.  This ranks among the more damaging decisions about the treatment 
                        of the early manuscripts. With blank leaves removed, we are prevented from seeing clearly where <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> might have left gaps in his fair-copying, intending to insert a passage or 
                        a drawing later--a practice that remains obvious in the extant arrangement. One wonders, too, whether the leaves were entirely blank; even a roughly penciled notation 
                        might have provided clues about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>’s plan.</p>
                    <p>Reconstruction of the original manuscript is rendered uncertain, since one cannot be absolutely certain how many leaves were removed. 
                        <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>’s page counts in PJR accurately describe <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> in its present condition. This means that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> skipped over blank leaves when numbering the manuscript--a practice 
                        consistent with his treatment of blank leaves in MS IVD--and these unnumbered leaves would have been the  pages  removed by <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>. Stubs do remain visible, 
                        but one cannot be confident that stubs would show for all the removed leaves, especially if the manuscript was removed and then rebound in its cover. 
                        In  Content  below, I have noted where a stub remains visible, which one may interpret as a leaf (i.e., two pages) that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> presumably intended to fill with writing or drawing. 
                        One must bear in mind, however, that not all stubs may be visible. The remaining stubs of the removed leaves should not be confused with stubs of a different paper--paper 
                        that is not ruled, as the original paper is, and protruding slightly beyond the original marbled edges. These stubs appear to have been inserted as part of the rebinding process, 
                        to which <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> alludes in his tipped-in sheet. As irrelevant to the notebook <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> used, these rebinding stubs are not listed in  Content  below. 
                        Only the stubs are mentioned of paper that clearly belonged to the original notebook.</p>

                        <head type="subsection">Collation</head>
                        <p>In the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php">Library Edition</ref>, 
                            the editors document that, as the contents of the "<title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account</title>" were collated in their time, a gallery of drawings followed the last page of extant fair-copied text. 
                            Hanging a note to that effect at the end of the poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRHEIDELBERG">&#x201C;Now from the smiling afternoon&#x201D; [&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;]</title>, 
                            the editors comment: &#x201C;In the MS. fair copy (ix.) two pages and a half are here left blank, and then follow 
                            the first four and a half lines of the prose passage . . . , the rest of which is supplied [by the editors] in the text from the draft in the earlier MS. (viii.)." 
                            That is, following the end of the poem on 46v, a leaf 47r-v is left blank, with the essay <title type="essay" corresp="#JRHEIDELBERGPROSE">&#x201C;Most beautiful are the paths&#x201D; [&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;]</title> 
                            starting half-way down on 48r, but breaking off midway in the first sentence of the essay, 
                            after the word &#x201C;sometimes&#x201D;. Here <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> stopped fair&#x2010;copying the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;, 
                            the editors supplying the remaining text of the work from rough draft in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> and other sources. 
                            In <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>, the editors go on, "[t]he fair copy ends at this point, so far as writing is concerned, but seven page&#x2010;sketches are inserted: 
                            (1) A mountain gorge; (2) mountain heights, a castle on one; (3) a river between steep banks, snow mountains in the distance; 
                            (4) a mountain scene, ch&#x00E2;let in foreground; (5) <emph>a</emph>, a mountain scene, <emph>b</emph>, a lake with a house on piers islanded on it; 
                            (6) a lake&#x2010;side, with terraced gardens, hills behind; (7) aiguilles. These sketches belong to the later portion of the "<title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Tour</title>", 
                            of which the author did not make a fair copy." As discussed in the apparatus to the "Account" (<ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#MAJORMS">Manuscripts</ref>), 
                            it is not possible to determine whether <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself assembled this gallery or another person did so when the manuscript was rebound.

One of these leaves (31r-v) has at some point been cut away from its stub; then, the loose leaf cut horizontally between the drawing and the prose at the bottom; and, finally, the two pieces have been taped back into place again, reattached to the stub. The piece with the drawing has  B  written at the side. See 37r-v, below.</item>

One leaf (37r-v) has been removed from its stub and then reattached with tape. Since the tape is the same as that used to reattach 31r-v, and since this entire leaf is reproduced in Works, one suspects that the leaf was detached so it could be photographed for the Library Edition. It is equally possible, however, that the editors took advantage of an existing separation.</item>
