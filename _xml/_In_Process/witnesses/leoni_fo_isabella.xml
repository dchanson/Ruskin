                        The lord of Castel Alto is old and gray - headed;
                        four - score years have flitted silently over him, and the
                        dream of his life is nigh to its awaking , and his ear is
                        dull , and his eye is dim , and his heart is weary .
                  </p><p>
                        The old man reclines on a couch in the hall of his
                        ancestors , beside an open casement , and the balmy air
                        that floats over the deep blue waters of the broad sea ,
                        passes softly through his thin hair , and his weary eye
                        rests on the brightness of a lovely landscape ; for the
                        olive , and the orange , and the myrtle , are green by the
                        shore of the still waters ; and the city lies whitely
                        beneath the glance of the sun , as he rides through the
                        cloudless azure of the heaven ; while the purple
                        mountains clasp the ocean in their arms , and fade
                        away into the horizon in long lines of misty blue .
                        Alas ! the spring time of nature is a mockery to the
                        winter of age , and Amalfiero turns away in sadness .
                        His vassals are waiting around him to do him pleasure ;
                        the minstrel is there with his harp , the maiden with
                  </p><p>
                        her song ; but no music is so sweet to the old man's
                        ear as the voice of his daughter Giulietta .
                        Giulietta , when a babe , was a thing of smiles and
                        loveliness , like a happy thought dancing over the
                        mind . Giulietta , when a child , was like the orange
                        blossom in the groves of Friuli , and gladness floated
                        around her like the fragrance of the flower . Giulietta ,
                        in her youth , was the fairest maiden of Italy , - she
                        glanced among the myrtle bowers like the winged
                        zephyr : the evening star , when it rises gleaming
                        out of the sea into the darkness of the glorious night
                        of Italy , is not so bright as the beam that flashed from
                        her large ege through the night of her lovely eye-
                        lashes . Giulietta's mind was love - all love to each
                        and every thing .
                        Like music to the sadness of the soul , was Giulietta
                        to the old age of her father . As she passed before
                        him , a light came into the coldness of his eye ; and his
                        ear , when it was dead to other sound , awoke to the
                        murmur of her gentle voice . As an angel watches
                        over the last days of a saint upon the earth , when the
                        tumult of the battle of his life is over , and sheds
                        peace around his hours , and bids his days pass sweetly
                        and holily , so Giulietta watched over Amalfiero like an
                        influence of good , and was the sun of his thoughts ,
                        and the light of his rejoicing .
                        Giulietta had a brother . Garcio d'Amalfiero was a
                        man of a dark countenance , and the shadows of his
                        evil passions passed over it , like clouds over the
                        luridness of the stormy heaven , and his look withered
                  </p><p>
                        those upon whom it fell , and his wrath , once excited ,
                        raged like a pestilence , and would not be appeased .
                        He was loved by few , and had many enemies , none of
                        whom he hated as he did the bandit Leoni , for him
                        only he feared .
                        Leoni's better nature had been borne down by the
                        violence of his passions , and he became what he ab-
                        horred , and widely was the fear of his name spread ;
                        for he passed over the land like a meteor , and left de-
                        solation behind him in the palaces of the great and
                        the powerful , but not in the hamlets of the poor .
                        Returning from a successful attack on the castle of
                        a neighbouring baron , Leoni had been once tracked to
                        the fastnesses of the Apennines by Garcio , with
                        a chosen troop of his followers . The bandit gave him
                        battle , and was , as usual , victorious ; the followers of
                        Garcio cowered back from his thunderbolt charge , and
                        Garcio himself was struck from his horse by the sword
                        of Leoni . It had been said of the bandit , that he had
                        never deserted a friend , nor spared an enemy ; but , as
                        his sabre waved over the head of his prostrate foe ,
                        the beaver of Garcio's helmet fell open : Leoni's arm was
                        arrested as if by the hand of an invisible being , a
                        smile of scorn passed over his lip , and then a mildness
                        came into his eye ; he turned calmly away ; and , to
                        the astonishment of his followers , sounded a retreat in
                        the very flush of victory , while Garcio and his dis-
                        heartened and vanquished band were suffered to retire
                        unmolested . From that time the hatred of Garcio to
                        Leoni was inextinguishable . The shame of defeat ,
                  </p><p>
                        and the thirst of revenge gnawed into his heart like
                        vultures , for he had rather have been laid dead by the
                        sword of Leoni , than have owed his life to the clemency
                        of his conqueror .

                        <persName corresp="#GIULIETTA">Giulietta</persName> sat in her chamber in the eastern tower of<lb/>
                        <placeName corresp="#CASTELALTO">Castel Alto</placeName>. The evening star rose out of the sea,<lb/>
                      and climbed slowly up into the sky, and <persName corresp="#GIULIETTA">Giulietta&#x02BC;s</persName><lb/>
                        dark eye rested sadly upon it. She was waiting for a<lb/>
                        voice that rose, every evening, from the <name type="botanical" corresp="#MYRTLE">myrtle grove</name><lb/>
                        below the castle, as that star disappeared behind the<lb/>
                        peak of a distant mountain. <persName corresp="#GIULIETTA">Giulietta</persName> hardly knew how<lb/>
                        very sweet the voice was to her listening ear, for it<lb/>
                        was the voice of one who loved her with a more than<lb/>
                        common love. They had first met when <persName corresp="#GIULIETTA">Giulietta</persName> was<lb/>
                        young, very young, and <persName corresp="#FRANCESCO">Francesco</persName> just verging into<lb/>
                      manhood&#x2013;from that hour she was the light of his<lb/>
                        path, and the joy of his heart. Her father knew<lb/>
                      not of his child&#x02BC;s love for <persName corresp="#FRANCESCO">Francesco</persName>, who pleaded<lb/>
                        to <persName corresp="#GIULIETTA">Giulietta</persName> some ancient feud of their families, as an<lb/>
                        excuse for maintaining his secresy.<lb/>
                     </p><p>
                       When the star touched the misty summit of the<lb/>
                        mountain, and <persName corresp="#GIULIETTA">Giulietta</persName> drew near to the window, a<lb/>
                         blush passed over her fair cheek as a minstrel&#x02BC;s song<lb/>
                        rose upon the breeze.<lb/></p>

                        With whom? What meanest thou? What art thou,<lb/>
                        <persName corresp="#FRANCESCO">Francesco</persName>?”</said><lb/>
                        <said who="#FRANCESCO">“I know not, maiden!” said <persName corresp="#FRANCESCO">Francesco</persName>, “I have<lb/>

                        And the name struck through to the maiden's heart<lb/>
                        with a coldness as of death; the cry she would have<lb/>
                        uttered died upon her lips, and she fainted in the arms<lb/>
                        of her lover.<lb/>
                        A hectic flush passed over her cheek, and she woke<lb/>
                        from the partial death with a deep gasp as of one in<lb/>
                        pain, and her dark eye was filled with a vague horror.<lb/>
                        <said who="#GIULIETTA">“<persName corresp="#FRANCESCO">Francesco</persName>, Francesco!” she said, “thou toldest me<lb/>

                        Great was the tumult at <placeName corresp="#CASTELALTO">Castel Alto</placeName>. An old fisher-<lb/>
                        man of <persName corresp="#POZZ">Pozzuolo</persName> had informed <persName corresp="#GARCIO">Garcio</persName> that he had<lb/>
                        seen two figures passing down westward on the sea-<lb/>
                            shore, at the foot of the castle. One was a maiden of<lb/>
                            exceeding beauty, the countenance of the other, he<lb/>
                            said, was one which he knew well, and which, once<lb/>
                            seen, was not easily forgotten, - that of the bandit<lb/>
                            <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName>. Then <persName corresp="#GARCIO">Garcio</persName> was wild with rage, and he<lb/>
                            called his followers together, and the clash of arms was<lb/>
                            loud in the hall, and then, from the gate of <placeName corresp="#CASTELALTO">Castel<lb/>
                                Alto</placeName>, issued a troop of warriors, and their mail shone<lb/>
                            cold in the starlight, and <persName corresp= "#GARCIO">Garcio</persName> spurred on his bloody<lb/>
                            war - horse in the van. His countenance was pale with<lb/>
                            wrath, and he dashed madly forward along the wind-<lb/>
                            ing shore.<lb/>
                        But one of the maidens of <persName corresp="#GUILIETTA">Giulietta</persName>, when she heard<lb/>
                            the peasant's tale she was not there: and in her cham-<lb/>
                            ber, and she was not there; and she descended by the<lb/>
                            secret staircase, and she saw footsteps in the dew on<lb/>
                            the grassy ground. Then she returned weeping, and<lb/>
                            came to <persName corresp="#AMAL">Amalfiero</persName>, and told him that <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName> the bandit<lb/>
                            had carried away <persName corresp="#GUILIETTA">Giulietta</persName>. And the old man was<lb/>
                            very feeble, and he bowed his head gently upon his<lb/>
                            breast and died.<lb/>

                        “Heardest thou nothing?” Giulietta said to Leoni.
                        “Nothing, Giulietta,” he replied. "Nay, now
                        that I listen, methinks I hear a sound, far away, like
                        the tramp of steeds along the sand.” And Giulietta
                        listened, and she was filled with great fear.
                        “Ohl fly, Leoni!” she said, “it is Garcio! fiy,
                        and leave me here!” But Leoni raised her in his
                        arms, and bare her softly forward.
                        And now the rocks were seen rising high from the
                       </p> <p>
                        sea - shore, with the columns of a ruined temple upon
                        their summit, and Leoni knew that his band was near.
                        “On, on, Giulietta!” he exclaimed, “one effort
                        more, and we are safe.” And now the tramp of the
                        galloping horses came nearer and nearer, and the
                        voices of men were heard urging them on. Louder
                        and louder became the sound, and Giulietta made one
                        last struggle forward, and, having gained the rocks,
                        the lovers stood beneath the ruins.
                        “Anselmo! Anselmo!” cried Leoni; and he was
                        answered, by a shout from the rocks, and the banditti
                        leaped from their concealment; but ere they gained
                        the shore, the foremost horseman of the opposite troop
                        dashed into view. It was Garcio. A shout of triumph
                        burst from his lips when he saw Leoni. Giulietta saw
                        him level his carbine, and, with a shriek of agony, she
                        threw herself before Leoni, and fell dead into his arms.
                        The band of Leoni heard the shot, and were around
                        him in an instant: and lo! their leader was standing
                        inactive beside the body of a maiden. There was a
                        stillness in his eye, and on his features; but it was as
                        the stillness of the volcano before it bursts forth into
                        desolation. His troops stood round him in a fearful
                        silence , and there was a pause, until, like a whirlwind
                        over the quietness of deep waters, came the madness
                        upon the soul of Leoni. He looked up, and saw that
                        his band was beside him.
                        “Stand by me, this night,” he said, “and revenge
                        the loss of your leader.” Then he shouted his war-
                        cry, and the banditti swelled the sound with eager
                        </p><p>
                            voices. The followers of <persName corresp="#GARCIO">Garcio</persName> replied, and <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName><lb/>
                            dashed at them like a thunderbolt. Then loudly into<lb/>
                            the quietness of the heaven rose the roar of the battle,<lb/>
                            and the echoes rolled heavily over the sea.<lb/>
                            <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName> burst his path through the mass of battle, and<lb/>
                            his bloodshot eye was on the crest of <persName corresp="#GARCIO">Garcio</persName>; and,<lb/>
                            whether it were foe or friend whom he met in his<lb/>
                            frenzy, he dashed the combatants aside, and clove<lb/>
                            his way to that one plume. With the implacable<lb/>
                            wrath of an avenging spirit, <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName> sought his single foe.<lb/>
                            The followers of <persName corresp="#GARCIO">Garcio</persName> shrunk from his glance, and, as<lb/>
                            he broke through the front of their battle, some turned<lb/>
                            and fled, and the rest hung back in disorder and dismay.<lb/>
                            Then <persName corresp="#GARCIO">Garcio</persName> saw <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName> come upon him with the<lb/>
                            swoop of an eagle, and his eye quailed before the des-<lb/>
                            pair of his foe.<lb/>
                            <said who="#LEONI">“Wretch,” cried <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName>, “lovest thou life? —O,<lb/>
                                would that I could make life to thee, what thou<lb/>
                                hast made it to me, and thou shouldst live! I spared<lb/>
                                thee once, for her sake, —thou hast well rewarded me!<lb/>
                                —thy sister strikes thee, <persName corresp="#GARCIO">Garcio</persName>!”</said> And he smote him<lb/>
                            dead.<lb/>
                            And the voice of battle drifted away towards<lb/>
                            <placeName corresp="#CASTELALTO">Castel Alto</placeName>, and the shouts of the victorious banditti<lb/>
                            were heard echoing along the cliffs. But <persName corresp="#LEONI">Leoni</persName> was<lb/>
                            no longer at their head; in their victory they were<lb/>
                            without a leader, -- they remembered that he had com-<lb/>
                            manded them to revenge his loss, and few, very few,<lb/>
                            of the followers of <persName corresp="#GARCIO">Garcio</persName>, escaped the slaughter of<lb/>
                            that night. The banditti met, and sought for Leoni<lb/>
                        </p><p>
                            among the dead, and they found the body of <persName corresp="#GARCIO">Garcio</persName>,<lb/>
                            and the sword of their leader lying beside it; but him<lb/>
                            they found not. And they retired, silently, under cover<lb/>
                            of the night, to their fastness among the mountains.<lb/>
                            O calmly, brightly, beautifully rose the morning<lb/>
                            out of the eastern sea, and widely spread the rosy<lb/>
                            dawn over the deep! Gloriously the radiance stole up<lb/>
                            into the high heaven, where the white clouds waved<lb/>
                            their light wings in the deepness of the infinite blue,<lb/>
                            and looked out eastward, rejoicing, as they met the<lb/>
                            morning breeze that sprang upward from its repose, in<lb/>
                            the grove of silver olives. And the sun lifted his<lb/>
                            head majestically out of the sea, and the mists passed<lb/>
                            away before his glance, from its surface, and the<lb/>
                            waves rolled onward, singing, with sweet low voices,<lb/>
                            and a long golden path was thrown upon them, even<lb/>
                            unto the shore.<lb/>
                            O the radiance of that morning was unconscious of<lb/>
                            the desolation of the night! There was no sadness in<lb/>
                            the dawn that shone on the ruins of <placeName corresp="#CASTELALTO">Castel Alto</placeName>. The<lb/>
                            surges that, in the night, had dashed away the blood<lb/>
                            from the shore, now broke clear and white on the un-<lb/>
                            stained pebbles. A figure was leaning against a rock<lb/>
                            on the strand. Few, very few could have recognised,<lb/>
                            in the haggard face, and withered form, the once<lb/>
                            haughty and fiery Leoni.<lb/>
                            The fishermen of <persName corresp="#POZZ">Pozzuolo</persName> affirm, that, for years<lb/>
                            after that terrible night, the same figure was seen<lb/>
                            pacing the shore, with the unequal step, and wild<lb/>
                            gestures of a maniac.<lb/>
