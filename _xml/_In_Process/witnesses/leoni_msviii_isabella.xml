                        in long lines of misty blue.<lb/>

                        Giulietta, when a babe, was a thing of smiles and loveliness<lb/>

                        Giulietta, when a child, was like the orange blossom in<lb/>

                        Like music to the sadness of the soul, was Giulietta<lb/>

                        a light came into the coldness of his eye; and his ear,<lb/>

                        “Francesco, Francesco! ” she said, “thou toldest me
                        something, - it was terrible, tell it me again. Fran-
                        cesco! -thou art not Francesco, "and she paused for a
                        moment. “I know now," she said; “I remember
                        well, very well, Francesco is dead, and thou — thou
                        art not, thou canst not, thou shalt not be Leoni, - the
                        bandit Leoni, - my brother's enemy. O, Francesco!
                        say thou mockest me!"
                        “I was once Leoni,” he replied; - “thy brother's
                        enemy never, or Garcio had not now lived. Could I
                        be the enemy of your brother, Giulietta?”
                        And Giulietta felt that it was Francesco, and not
                        Leoni who spoke, and she paused in deep agony.
                        
                        * * * * *
                        
                        Great was the tumult at Castel Alto . An old fisher-
                        man of Pozzuolo had informed Garcio that he had
                        seen two figures passing down westward on the sea-
                        shore , at the foot of the castle . One was a maiden of
                        exceeding beauty , the countenance of the other , he
                        
                        said , was one which he knew well , and which , once
                        seen , was not easily forgotten , - that of the bandit
                        Leoni . Then Garcio was wild with rage , and he
                        called his followers together , and the clash of arms was
                        loud in the hall , and then , from the gate of Castel
                        Alto , issued a troop of warriors , and their mail shone
                        cold in the starlight , and Garcio spurred on his bloody
                        war - horse in the van . His countenance was pale with
                        wrath , and he dashed madly forward along the wind-
                        ing shore .
                        But one of the maidens of Giulietta , when she heard
                        the peasant's tale , went and sought for her in her
                        father's hall , and she was not there : and in her cham-
                        ber , and she was not there ; and she descended by the
                        secret staircase , and she saw footsteps in the dew on
                        the grassy ground . Then she returned weeping , and
                        came to Amalfiero , and told him that Leoni the bandit
                        had carried away Giulietta . And the old man was
                        very feeble , and he bowed his head gently upon his
                        breast and died .
                        
                        * * * * *
                        
                        “ Heardest thou nothing ? ” Giulietta said to Leoni .
                        “ Nothing , Giulietta , ” he replied . " Nay , now
                        that I listen , methinks I hear a sound , far away , like
                        the tramp of steeds along the sand . ” And Giulietta
                        listened , and she was filled with great fear .
                        “ Ohl fly , Leoni ! ” she said , “ it is Garcio ! fiy ,
                        and leave me here ! ” But Leoni raised her in his
                        arms , and bare her softly forward .
                        And now the rocks were seen rising high from the

                        sea - shore , with the columns of a ruined temple upon
                        their summit , and Leoni knew that his band was near .
                        “ On , on , Giulietta ! ” he exclaimed , “ one effort
                        more , and we are safe . ” And now the tramp of the
                        galloping horses came nearer and nearer , and the
                        voices of men were heard urging them on . Louder
                        and louder became the sound , and Giulietta made one
                        last struggle forward , and , having gained the rocks ,
                        the lovers stood beneath the ruins .
                        “ Anselmo ! Anselmo ! ” cried Leoni ; and he was
                        answered , by a shout from the rocks , and the banditti
                        leaped from their concealment ; but ere they gained
                        the shore , the foremost horseman of the opposite troop
                        dashed into view . It was Garcio . A shout of triumph
                        burst from his lips when he saw Leoni . Giulietta saw
                        him level his carbine , and , with a shriek of agony , she
                        threw herself before Leoni , and fell dead into his arms .
                        The band of Leoni heard the shot , and were around
                        him in an instant : and lo ! their leader was standing
                        inactive beside the body of a maiden . There was a
                        stillness in his eye , and on his features ; but it was as
                        the stillness of the volcano before it bursts forth into
                        desolation . His troops stood round him in a fearful
                        silence , and there was a pause , until , like a whirlwind
                        over the quietness of deep waters , came the madness
                        upon the soul of Leoni . He looked up , and saw that
                        his band was beside him .
                        “ Stand by me , this night , ” he said , “ and revenge
                        the loss of your leader . ” Then he shouted his war-
                        cry , and the banditti swelled the sound with eager
                        
                        voices . The followers of Garcio replied , and Leoni
                        dashed at them like a thunderbolt . Then loudly into
                        the quietness of the heaven rose the roar of the battle ,
                        and the echoes rolled heavily over the sea .
                        Leoni burst his path through the mass of battle , and
                        his bloodshot eye was on the crest of Garcio ; and ,
                        whether it were foe or friend whom he met in his
                        frenzy , he dashed the combatants aside , and clove
                        his way to that one plume . With the implacable
                        wrath of an avenging spirit , Leoni sought his single foe .
                        The followers of Garcio shrunk from his glance , and , as
                        he broke through the front of their battle , some turned
                        and fled , and the rest hung back in disorder and dismay .
                        Then Garcio saw Leoni come upon him with the
                        swoop of an eagle , and his eye quailed before the des-
                        pair of his foe .
                        “ Wretch , ” cried Leoni , “ lovest thou life ? —O ,
                        would that I could make life to thee , what thou
                        hast made it to me , and thou shouldst live ! I spared
                        thee once , for her sake , —thou hast well rewarded me !
                        —thy sister strikes thee , Garcio ! ” And he smote him
                        dead .
                        And the voice of battle drifted away towards
                        Castel Alto , and the shouts of the victorious banditti
                        were heard echoing along the cliffs . But Leoni was
                        no longer at their head ; in their victory they were
                        without a leader , -- they remembered that he had com-
                        manded them to revenge his loss , and few , very few ,
                        of the followers of Garcio , escaped the slaughter of
                        that night . The banditti met , and sought for Leoni
                        
                        among the dead , and they found the body of Garcio ,
                        and the sword of their leader lying beside it ; but him
                        they found not . And they retired , silently , under cover
                        of the night , to their fastness among the mountains .
                        O calmly , brightly , beautifully rose the morning
                        out of the eastern sea , and widely spread the rosy
                        dawn over the deep ! Gloriously the radiance stole up
                        into the high heaven , where the white clouds waved
                        their light wings in the deepness of the infinite blue ,
                        and looked out eastward , rejoicing , as they met the
                        morning breeze that sprang upward from its repose , in
                        the grove of silver olives . And the sun lifted his
                        head majestically out of the sea , and the mists passed
                        away before his glance , from its surface , and the
                        waves rolled onward , singing , with sweet low voices ,
                        and a long golden path was thrown upon them , even
                        unto the shore .
                        O the radiance of that morning was unconscious of
                        the desolation of the night ! There was no sadness in
                        the dawn that shone on the ruins of Castel Alto . The
                        surges that , in the night , had dashed away the blood
                        from the shore , now broke clear and white on the un-
                        stained pebbles . A figure was leaning against a rock
                        on the strand . Few , very few could have recognised ,
                        in the haggard face , and withered form , the once
                        haughty and fiery Leoni .
                        The fishermen of Pozzuolo affirm , that , for years
                        after that terrible night , the same figure was seen
                        pacing the shore , with the unequal step , and wild
                        gestures of a maniac .
