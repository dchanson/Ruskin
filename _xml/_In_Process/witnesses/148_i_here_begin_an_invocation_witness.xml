                <p>148. &#x201C;I here begin an invocation,&#x201D; <date when="1831-12">December 1831</date> to 
                    <date when="1832-01">January 1832</date>, MS VIII. Previously unpublished.</p>
                
                <p>Nos. 148&#x2013;56 and 158 are listed by their seriatim positions in MS VIII; their two-month parameters for dating 
                    are established by nos. 147 and 159; see also no. 152.</p>
                
                <p>No. 148 concerns <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin’s</persName> getting &#x201C;hapenny a line&#x201D; for his Greek, probably referring to his translation of the 
                    Iliad. In a letter of <date when="1832-02-20">February 20, 1832</date>, he counts lines of his Homer, presumably for payment, since he is 
                    &#x201D;translating forty lines . . . per day most regularly, an employment which I suppose you would very gladly 
                    allow me to break off from&#x201D; (RFL, 262)&#x2014;his irony and his 40-per-day quota matching earlier remarks about 
                    payment for &#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D; (see no. 91). Since no. 148 heads a page on which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> resumes his draft of &#x201C;Athens&#x201D; 
                    (no. 135), he may also have expected halfpennies for lines of this epic, just as he had gotten a farthing per 
                    line of &#x201C;Iteriad.&#x201D; Payment for the Iliad translation is better documented, however. </p>
