                   the stillness of the volcano before it bursts forth into<lb/>
                   desolation. His troops stood round him in a fearful<lb/>
                   silence, and there was a pause, until, like a whirlwind<lb/>
                   over the quietness of deep waters, came the madness<lb/>
                   upon the soul of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LEONI-LEONI">Leoni</persName>. He looked up, and saw that<lb/>
