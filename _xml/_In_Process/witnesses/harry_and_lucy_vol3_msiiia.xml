                            beautiful road to <placeName corresp="#SCARTHINGMOOR">scarthing moor</placeName> here there were a fox and a dog
                            both which <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">harry</persName> saw. From <placeName corresp="#SCARTHINGMOOR">scarthing moor</placeName> they went to <placeName corresp="#WITHAMCOMMON">witham
                            common</placeName> and setting off early in the morning and arriving late at
                            night they gained their home.</p>
                        <p>It is impossible to describe the bustle, running to and fro
                            and congratulation on this occasion it is sufficient to say that
                            <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">harry</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> were tired and running to their own room they went
                            to bed.</p>
                        <p>As soon as <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">harry</persName> rose he determined to allot his time to
                            various employments and he did it thus. In the morning he was to
                            teach <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> science, after breakfast he was to learn his lessons,
                            having to draw maps he was to do that till dinner time, he had
                            also to correct some of <persName corresp="#PVM">virgil</persName> for his <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PAPA">papa</persName> that occupied half
                            the afternoon and the rest was spent in map making. After tea as

                        <p>In pursuance of his first design <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> took one of his
                            lesson books and made <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> learn the following constellations

                            of which taking his atlas he first drew the outlines, he then
                            began to write the names round the outline &#x0026; then to do the water

                            he was composing for his father on newyearsday a as he always
                            presented him b with a poem at that period. The subject of it was
                            a battle between the Pretender or Chevalier as <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> would have

                            be sure. It was irregular measure.</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> when he had done what he thought a moderate allowance
                            of his poem went to his map But scarcely had the pen touched the

                            and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> returned to his map. He f today nearly finished it, &#x0026; g
                            after having had some of <title type="book" corresp="#CERVANTESDONQUIXOTE">Don Quixote</title> he went to bed.</p>
                        <p>But whenever the world was left &#x2018;To darkness and to me&#x2019; a
                            bright thought came into <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">harry</persName>&#x02BC;s mind <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> h thought<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="harry_and_lucy_vol3_glosses_contextual.php#HARRYTHOUGHTGLOSS"/> that if he
                            could contrive to make a <title type="drama" corresp="#PUNCHANDJUDY">Punches</title> show or rather fantoccini out of
                            paper he could exhibit it when he presented his poem and please
                            his father a little more so he fell to work to plan i one. First
                            he settled the size which was to be about five inches long two
                            broad and two side ways. The top where the figures were to act
                            was to be 2 j inches square.</p>
                        <p>This settled <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> began to think how he should make it
                            <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> k first thought what shape the piece of paper must be before
                            it was put together so as to form the show After he had altered
                            a good deal he found that it must be of this shape [diagram] with
                            margins for joining The piece marked A formed one of the sides,
                            that B the front of the show C was to be bent back and with a
                            small slit in it formed the bottom of the place where the figures
                            were to act D the top of the show E the other side and F the
                            back so that the whole show when put together was like this
                            [diagram] l The figures<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="harry_and_lucy_vol3_glosses_contextual.php#MSIIIAGLOSS"/></p>
                        <p>Upon this piece of paper a macaw or parrot was to be drawn
                            with the most gay and amusing.</p>
                        <p>The figures were first to be drawn with pen and ink upon
                            pieces of pasteboard these were then to be cut out and fastened
                            to sticks with gum and being introduced at the bottom of the show
                            were pushed up to the top and there danced about. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> now being
                            quite satisfied &lt;in the&gt; with his plan fell asleep and slept
                            soundly and in the morning made <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">lucy</persName> learn these constellations
                            and by the time she had finished them tinkle tinkle went the
                            breakfast bell. Passing over the sundry little mistakes and
                            ocurrances <!--sic--> which made their appearance at breakfast we
                            shall go to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">harrys</persName> poem Alas he was to use his own words in a

                            how was he to get a poem finished consisting of 89 lines finished
                            in that style of printing with the show it was altogether
                            impossible So <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">harry</persName> put off the show till his fathers birthday.
