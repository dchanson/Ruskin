                        so quickly that he had from three &#x2010; <lb/>
                        to nine to play but he did not play <lb/>

                        but I like it the better.” <lb/>
                        But I can tell you you’ll be &#x2010; <lb/>
                        very sleepy and tired by the way <lb/>
                        I don’t care for that said Harry<lb/>

                        So much the better said Harry<lb/>
                        But by this time the carriage <lb/>
                        had got to the door and all getting <lb/>
                        in drove off[—]” <lb/> </p>
                    <p> 
                        First they came to a common pub <lb/>
                        lic road with hedges on each &#x2010; <lb/>
                        side of it till at last they came <lb/>
                        to a beautiful road sometimes <lb/>
                        hedges sometimes none at all <lb/>
                        sometimes landscapes sometimes &#x2010; <lb/>
                        none at all hills hillocks mounts <lb/>
                        rivulets rivers ponds lakes all <lb/>
                        in profusion sometimes high <lb/>

                        valley and all along the same &#x2010; <lb/>
                        Harry and Lucys mother had <lb/>
                        a certain friend living near this <lb/>
                        place and they went to see him &#x2010; <lb/>
                        here they saw many pretty and <lb/>
                        useful flowers such as the <lb/>
                        mimosa the papyrus and the <lb/>
                        coffee tree and after having <lb/>
                        had a good run they got into <lb/>
                        the carriage and drove into <lb/>
                        salt hill[—] <lb/> </p>
                    <p> 
                        But here they stayed only to <lb/>
                        dinner or else Harry would <lb/>
                        have had a fine swing there <lb/>
                        being a nice one in the ground<lb/>
                        But such little disappointments &#x2010;<lb/>
                        must be put up with and they &#x2010; <lb/>
                        went on.” <lb/> </p>
                    <p>    
                        Soon after this they came to the <lb/>
                        [same(?)]1 road again and after rid <lb/>

                        long time and changing hors &#x2010;<lb/>
                        es often they reached oxford[—] <lb/> </p>
                     <p>   
                         But it was so very late when they<lb/>
                         arrived at oxford that they could <lb/>
                         not see any thing but they were <lb/>
                         told that they were to stay all night <lb/>
                         at the hotel and in the morning &#x2010;<lb/>
                         went to see the colleges. They might <lb/>
                         have seen the inside if they had time<lb/>
                         but they had not so that they only went<lb/>
                         round<lb/>
                         them looked at their architecture<lb/>
                         and went home[—]” <lb/></p>
                     <p>   
                         Their father and mother thought <lb/>
                         very much of it but they had not <lb/>
                         much time to think about it &#x2010;<lb/>
                         for harry asked what the dis<lb/>
                         tance might be from gloster which<lb/>
                         he was told they were going to next &#x2010;<lb/>  
                         his father told him that he did not<lb/> 
                         know and [now(?)]2 the carriage drove<lb/>

                    <p>   
                        But just as they were passing a <lb/>
                        fine elm they saw a large pond<lb/>
                        perhaps a mile broad going complet{e}ly3<lb/>
                        across the road without any bridge <lb/>
                        and the horses plunged into it  whats<lb/>
                        this cried Harry  Where are we going<lb/>
                        now cried Lucy they went on on <lb/>
                        deeper and deeper into the &#x2010;<lb/>
                        water and at length they went com&#x2010; <lb/>
                        pletely through the pond and went forward on their<lb/>

                    <p>    
                        For some time the road was very hilly chalky &#2010;<lb/>

                         the bustle occasioned by packing<lb/>

                      beautiful window for first there<lb/>
                      was an arch and then by its&#x2010;<lb/>
                      sides and top there were all<lb/>
                      kinds of figures. The door was<lb/>
                      in this shape [diagram] and when their<lb/>
                      guide had opened it they found<lb/>
                      themselves in a large abbey with<lb/>
                      two rows of pillars one on each <lb/>
                      side of them but broken and<lb/>
                      ruined. Their guide showed &#x2010;<lb/>
                      them some keystones of the&#x2010;<lb/>
                      arches that had fallen down and harry wondered why the arches did not fall with them  He looked up and saw no gap in the arch and he asked his father what was the reason of all this but his father was busy looking at other things and so Harry was obliged to go to the same ones. After looking for a good while at these Harry and Lucy began to get tired but soon their guide took them through a passage which led them past several ruined rooms. Going through one of these they found themselves on a little green with a hillock [diagram?] on one side of it  from the green nothing was seen but a stone wall but when harry ascended the hillock no view could be more beautiful  they then went out of the abbey and went on to windcliff having gone through a cottage they saw a high rock as perpendicular as the wall of a house full of crags and white  harry was rather puzzled when he was told that he was to climb up this rock but the man who led them carried them by gentle sloping walks which carried them up to the top of the rock without the least difficulty
                        They thought that the coming down would not be so easy but it was much easier because it was a gentle slope  when they were safe down they jumped into the carriage and drove off
                        In a few minutes they saw the sea and presently they came to the side of it  they were presently aboard a steamboat and soon they arrived at the other side7 they then jumped into the carriage and drove off  they soon arrived at kinross here they took tea and drove off to Perth  Harry and Lucy were so sleepy that they were forced to go to bed whenever they arrived in Perth  their house chanced to be directly opposite the tay with the north inch completely between them and the tay  so when they arose in the morning they thought they would like to go out and take a walk and Harry took his little boat with him thinking it would take a nice sail in the tay but he was disappointed for the tay was so rough that his vessel immediately turned topsy turvy  seeing that to sail his vessel was impossible he took a nice walk with Lucy[,] and then returned home. They had seen some fine ups and downs on the inch so they thought they would hav{e}8 some play on them  Harry then determined to give Lucy a lesson of science so he thought he would show her this experiment.
                        Harry then took an ale glass[,] [plate]9 and plunged it with the mouth downwards into a jar of water and very little water entered into it.
                        Lucy enquired the reason of this and harry said that the air in the glass was compressed into the smaller space and would not let the water come in farther10
                        chap III
                        HARRYS mother now said to him that it was time to go out so Harry and Lucy put on their things and went out upon the inch they went to the ups and downs which they had seen the last time they were out  and first of all Harry first proposed running up and down the upandowns but lucy proposed breaking spars which harry agreed to and they got many beautiful spars by lucys plan when they came home they showed their spars to their mother who said that there were some different metals in them which Harry and Lucy were very well pleased at.  it was now dinner time and after dinner Harry drew till teatime then wrote a letter for his mother an went to bed.
                        This was the second day they had been at perth and on the morrow they were to march off	
                        When harry arose in the morning he found all busy with packing and soon they jumped into the carriage and drove off to kinross
                        Here Harry went out to see the lake of lochleven and when he came in his shoes were thoroughly wet through he had been so near the lake  he now drew a copy of a church that was close to the inn where they were and then got into the carriage and drove off to Queens ferry.
                        While crossing the water the steamboat pitched so that harry could hardly keep upon his legs but when harry got to edinburgh he had such a comfortable room comfortable dinner and comfortable tea that he quite forgot all pitching and travelling.
                        Whenever harry got up in the morning he went out to the top of the carlton hill with his papa and when he came in he found the carriage waiting for him into which he jumped and in a few minutes they came in sight of the sea  they travelled by the sea a long while and then going away from it they came to haddington where harry expected to see the sea very well
                        But when harry came to haddington they saw nothing but a long street which rather disappointed harry but when they came to berwick they saw the sea finely
                        In the morning harry went out on the walls with his father and when he came in jumped into the carriage and drove off to alnwick here harry went with his father to see the castle and then drove off to newcastle  it here began snowing very fast so that harry could not get out nor could Lucy for if they had gone out they would have tumbled every five minutes but when they set off they soon got to durham where they changed horses and went on to darlington here they slept and in the morning went on to boroughbridge.  the reason it was called so was that a very beautiful bridge was in the town the room which they had got had a bookcase in it and harry met with his favourite history of sandford and merton which he had not finished before he was forced to go on to ferrybridge which he was rather sorry for but it was made up at ferrybridge for there they had a complete view of the river which flowed through the town.
                        Here they slept and in the morning went off for doncaster this was a beautiful town there was an avenue of trees through which they passed to go into the town  well from this avenue the high towers of the cathedral gilded by the rays of the sun and the mountains at a distance looked so beautiful that people must see it to comprehend it even the great bass with its multitudes of seafowl could not equal this and what made the bass the more charming was that the bass was seen at sunset while this was seen at noon  But I will put them on to scarthing moor in another chapter.
