                        so quickly that he had from three &#x2010; <lb/>
                        to nine to play but he did not play <lb/>
                        he spent from three to half past <lb/>

                        but I like it the better.” <lb/>
                        But I can tell you you’ll be &#x2010; <lb/>
                        very sleepy and tired by the way <lb/>
                        I don’t care for that said Harry<lb/>

                        So much the better said Harry<lb/>
                        But by this time the carriage <lb/>
                        had got to the door and all getting <lb/>
                        in drove off[—]” <lb/> </p>
                    <p> 
                        First they came to a common pub <lb/>
                        lic road with hedges on each &#x2010; <lb/>
                        side of it till at last they came <lb/>
                        to a beautiful road sometimes <lb/>
                        hedges sometimes none at all <lb/>
                        sometimes landscapes sometimes &#x2010; <lb/>
                        none at all hills hillocks mounts <lb/>
                        rivulets rivers ponds lakes all <lb/>
                        in profusion sometimes high <lb/>

                        valley and all along the same &#x2010; <lb/>
                        Harry and Lucys mother had <lb/>
                        a certain friend living near this <lb/>
                        place and they went to see him &#x2010; <lb/>
                        here they saw many pretty and <lb/>
                        useful flowers such as the <lb/>
                        mimosa the papyrus and the <lb/>
                        coffee tree and after having <lb/>
                        had a good run they got into <lb/>
                        the carriage and drove into <lb/>
                        salt hill[—] <lb/> </p>
                    <p> 
                        But here they stayed only to <lb/>
                        dinner or else Harry would <lb/>
                        have had a fine swing there <lb/>
                        being a nice one in the ground<lb/>
                        But such little disappointments &#x2010;<lb/>
                        must be put up with and they &#x2010; <lb/>
                        went on.” <lb/> </p>
                    <p>    
                        Soon after this they came to the <lb/>
                        [same(?)]1 road again and after rid <lb/>

                        long time and changing hors &#x2010;<lb/>
                        es often they reached oxford[—] <lb/> </p>
                     <p>   
                         But it was so very late when they<lb/>
                         arrived at oxford that they could <lb/>
                         not see any thing but they were <lb/>
                         told that they were to stay all night <lb/>
                         at the hotel and in the morning &#x2010;<lb/>
                         went to see the colleges. They might <lb/>
                         have seen the inside if they had time<lb/>
                         but they had not so that they only went<lb/>
                         round<lb/>
                         them looked at their architecture<lb/>
                         and went home[—]” <lb/></p>
                     <p>   
                         Their father and mother thought <lb/>
                         very much of it but they had not <lb/>
                         much time to think about it &#x2010;<lb/>
                         for harry asked what the dis<lb/>
                         tance might be from gloster which<lb/>
                         he was told they were going to next &#x2010;<lb/>  
                         his father told him that he did not<lb/> 
                         know and [now(?)]2 the carriage drove<lb/>

                    <p>   
                        But just as they were passing a <lb/>
                        fine elm they saw a large pond<lb/>
                        perhaps a mile broad going complet{e}ly3<lb/>
                        across the road without any bridge <lb/>
                        and the horses plunged into it  whats<lb/>
                        this cried Harry  Where are we going<lb/>
                        now cried Lucy they went on on <lb/>
                        deeper and deeper into the &#x2010;<lb/>
                        water and at length they went com&#x2010; <lb/>
                        pletely through the pond and went forward on their<lb/>

                    <p>    
                        For some time the road was very hilly chalky &#2010;<lb/>
                        sandy and watery but soon it grew &#x2010;<lb/>
                        very dusty and such a fine day that they &#x2010;<lb/>

                        Here Harry went out to see <lb/>
                        the lake of lochleven and when he <lb/>
                        came in his shoes were thoroughly<lb/>

                        where they were and then got&#x2010;<lb/>

                        steamboat pitched so that harry<lb/>
                        could hardly keep upon his legs<lb/>
                        but when harry got to edinburgh<lb/>
                        he had such a comfortable room&#x2010;<lb/>
                        comfortable dinner and comfortable<lb/> 
                        tea<lb/>
                        that he quite forgot all pitch<lb/>

                        the top of the carlton hill with<lb/>
                        his papa and when he came in<lb/>
                        he found the carriage waiting<lb/>
                        for him into which he jumped&#x2010;<lb/>
                        and in a few minutes they came<lb/>
                        in sight of the sea  they travelled<lb/>
                        by the sea a long while and&#x2010;<lb/>
                        then going away from it they&#x2010;<lb/>
                        came to haddington where&#x2010;<lb/>
                        harry expected to see the sea&#x2010;<lb/>
                        very well<lb/></p>
                     <p>

                         dington they saw nothing but<lb/>
                         a long street which rather&#x2010;<lb/>
                         disappointed harry but when they&#x2010;<lb/>
                         came to berwick they saw the sea<lb/>

                    <p>    
                        In the morning harry went out<lb/>
                        on the walls with his father and<lb/>
                        when he came in jumped into<lb/>

                        began snowing very fast so that&#x2010;<lb/>
                        harry could not get out nor could&#x2010;<lb/>
                        Lucy for if they had gone out they&#x2010;<lb/>
                        would have tumbled every five&#x2010;<lb/>
                        minutes but when they set off they soon<lb/>
                        got to durham where they changed horses and<lb/>
                        went on to darlington here they slept and in the mor<lb/>
                        ning went on to boroughbridge.  the reason it was called<lb/>
                        so was that a very beautiful bridge was in the<lb/>
                        town the room which they had got had a book<lb/>
                        case in it and harry met with his favourite&#x2010;<lb/>
                        history of sandford and merton which he had<lb/>
                        not finished before he was forced to go on to<lb/>
                        ferrybridge which he was rather sorry for<lb/>
                        but it was made up at ferrybridge&#x2010;<lb/>
                        for there they had a complete view of<lb/>
                        the river which flowed through the<lb/> 
                        town.<lb/></p>

                       went off for doncaster this was a&#x2010;<lb/>
                       beautiful town there was an avenue of&#x2010;<lb/>
                       trees through which they passed to go in<lb/>
                       to the town  well from this avenue the high&#x2010;<lb/>
                       towers of the cathedral gilded by the rays<lb/>
                       of the sun and the mountains at a distance<lb/>
                       looked so beautiful that people must see it<lb/>
                       to comprehend it even the great bass&#x2010;<lb/>
                       with its multitudes of seafowl could&#x2010;<lb/>
                       not equal this and what made the bass<lb/>
                       the more charming was that the bass<lb/>
                       was seen at sunset while this was seen<lb/>
                       at noon  But I will put them on to&#x2010;<lb/>
