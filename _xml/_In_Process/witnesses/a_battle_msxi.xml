                    <l>THE Summit of <geogName corresp="#SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</geogName> was gilt by the sun,</l>
                    <l>When first he appeared, when the morning begun:</l>
                    <l>And the rays of the morning fell lone on the dale,</l>
                    <l>When the troops of the English gan enter the vale.</l>
                    <l>The Scotch came swiftly down from the wood upon the hill</l>
                    <l>And spread themselves along by the side of derwent rill</l>
                    <l>And the English they came upon the road from <placeName corresp="#PENRITH">Penrith</placeName></l>
                    <l>And their horses and their chargers, they galloped on so swift</l>
                    <l>And their flags flew around and their swords waved on high</l>
                    <l>But all these dismayed not an Highlandmans eye</l>
                    <l>On the right of the lake stood the clan of bold Ivor</l>
                    <l>Their chieftain his name was brave <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FERGUSMACIVOR">Fergus Mac&#x2010;Ivor</persName></l>
                    <l>And as he stood beside the lake he drew forth his claymore</l>
                    <l>And he said unto his clan think of whats been done before</l>
                    <l>And think of the acts of the last Vich Ian Vohr.</l>
                    <l>At this Mac&#x2010;Ivors clan</l>
                    <l>To the battle quickly ran</l>
                    <l>Brave <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FERGUSMACIVOR">Fergus</persName> was the first</l>
                    <l>To strike unto the dust</l>
                    <l>An Englishman though bold</l>
                    <l>His life had no strong hold</l>
                    <l>For <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FERGUSMACIVOR">Fergus</persName> with one blow</l>
                    <l>Sent him to the shades below</l>
                    <l>Now the army of the White Cockade</l>
                    <l>Rushed on to give Mac&#x2010;Ivor aid</l>
                    <l>And charged at once the English band</l>
                    <l>Some charged in water, some on land</l>
                    <l>The Chevalier was all the cry</l>
                    <l>For him for him we live and die</l>
                    <l>The English waved on high their swords</l>
                    <l>And cut and hacked at <geogName corresp="#SCOTTISHHIGHLANDS">Highland</geogName> lords</l>
                    <l>And pushed at them with pike and spear</l>
                    <l>But not one particle of fear</l>
                    <l>Attacked the Highlanders so brave</l>
                    <l>For they cared not one life to save</l>
                    <l>But when they saw the spears advance</l>
                    <l>With polished head and lightning glance</l>
                    <l>Each man drew his claymore</l>
                    <l>And of English&#x2010;men a score</l>
                    <l>That instant headless made</l>
                    <l>And all were quickly laid</l>
                    <l>To sleep the sleep of death</l>
                    <l>After they breathed their last breath</l>
                    <l>But <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FERGUSMACIVOR">Fergus</persName> on too boldly ran</l>
                    <l>And separated from his clan</l>
                    <l>Deep in the ardour of the war</l>
                    <l>Fighting full brave his clan him saw</l>
                    <l>Surrounded by an English band</l>
                    <l>With his good broad claymore in hand</l>
                    <l>And each blow that his good hand gave</l>
                    <l>One man not all his friends could save</l>
                    <l>A hundred blows he now had given</l>
                    <l>A hundred times he now had striven</l>
                    <l>To gain his clan but foe&#x02BC;s <!--sic--> opposed</l>
                    <l>At length oppressed with many throes</l>
                    <l>Fatigued not conquered <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FERGUSMACIVOR">Fergus</persName> made</l>
                    <l>A signal to his clan for aid</l>
                    <l>But ah in vain engaged in war</l>
                    <l>Though they their chieftains signal saw</l>
                    <l>They could not come to him just then</l>
                    <l>For they were deep in war which when</l>
                    <l><persName type="fictional" corresp="#FERGUSMACIVOR">Fergus</persName> saw he was forced to yield</l>
                    <l>And was carried off from fighting field</l>
                    <l>Now now Mac&#x2010;Ivors clan</l>
                    <l>From the war a small way ran</l>
                    <l>They halted at the wood</l>
                    <l>And as they firmly stood</l>
                    <l>They saw the English rushing</l>
                    <l>Trampling on and crushing</l>
                    <l>The Chevaliers good host</l>
                    <l>They saw the day was lost</l>
                    <l>And they were going to call</l>
                    <l>Their brave companions all</l>
                    <l>When they saw the noble spanish blade</l>
                    <l>Of the Chevalier raised and he said</l>
                    <l>Retreat my friends lost is this day</l>
                    <l>If any can regain it say</l>
                    <l>But I think that this day is lost</l>
                    <l>The chief of Ivor in yon host</l>
                    <l>Retreat retreat again I say</l>
                    <l>And let us be upon our way</l>
                    <l>At this the bagpipes sound then drew</l>
                    <l>The chiefs around for well they knew</l>
                    <l>That at the bagpipes sound they were</l>
                    <l>Then to retreat or rush to war</l>
                    <l>The chiefs got clans in martial rank</l>
                    <l>And ranging all on <geogName corresp="#DERWENTWATER">Derwents</geogName> bank</l>
                    <l>They gan their march with lonely sound</l>
                    <l>Which <geogName corresp="#SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</geogName> echoed all around.</l>
