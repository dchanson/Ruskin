                    <l>Then mountains fell, and Vales unknown before,</l>

                    <l>Four seeming milkdrops have their noble bower</l>
                    <l>These insects feed on, and they gather quick</l>
                    <l>While each applies the liquid to the lip</l>

                    <l>I mean the alysson with a yellow face</l>
                    <l>This flower in thickest yellow cluster grows</l>
                    <l>And only its old mother earth well knows</l>
                    <l>A purple flower I now make known to fame</l>
                    <l>Tis sometimes white and tis known by the name</l>
                    <l>Of columbine in pods kept are its seeds</l>
                    <l>And sometimes columbines are really weeds</l>
                    <l>The lily of the valley now doth come</l>
                    <l>Its large leaves hide its face quite from the sun</l>
                    <l>Beautiful maid so modest and so sweet</l>

                    <l>And from its pretty bells such odours flow</l>
                    <l>As might have sent great <persName type="fictional" corresp="#JUPITERGOD">Jupiter</persName> to sleep</l>
                    <l>When all the world was fighting at his feet</l>
                    <l>A purple colour doth the flag adorn</l>
                    <l>It looks like velvet opening to the morn</l>

                    <l>Every one should be sad that it must die.</l>
                    <l>Then in the comfrey mixed are blue and red</l>
                    <l>Odd colours that in flowers they should wed</l>
                    <l>But when together they are quite as sweet</l>
                    <l>As both the colours are when they dont meet</l>
                    <l>Crimson geranium long and pretty name</l>
                    <l>This flow&#x02BC;r is sometimes called bill of the crane</l>
                    <l>Or cranesbill. Lightish crimson is its hue</l>
                    <l>Another&#x02BC;s colour is a kind of blue</l>

                    <l>Thou must now beauteous wondrous flowr</l>

                    <l>Putting to shame all done by mortal hand</l>
                    <l>And its sweet head of such a crimson hue</l>
                    <l>Tis wonderful that from a seed it grew</l>
                    <l>Then Gilder rose small flowers connected all</l>
                    <l>And when connected their shape is a ball</l>
                    <l>As white as snow something like provence rose</l>
                    <l>In a large bush this noble flower grows</l>
                    <l>Then the sweet William like the Indian Pink</l>

                    <l>All all will know the trumpet is its name</l>
                    <l>This is the trumpet flowr so named because</l>
                    <l>Its shape extremely near the trumpet draws</l>
                    <l>And now that flowr Flowr indeed of sleep</l>
                    <l>Flower to make too many mothers weep</l>

                    <l>Now comes the foxglove with its hanging bells</l>
                    <l>But ah alas its nature poison tells</l>
                    <l>Attractive beautiful but pois&#x02BC;nous too</l>
                    <l>Foxglove I would not dare to play with you</l>
                    <l>Now comes the king of flowrs Though rose the queen</l>

                    <l>White lily tis Oh look at that fair crown</l>
                    <l>From that green stalk so high depending down</l>
                    <l>Fair on its dark green leaves that crimson flowr</l>
                    <l>Darts bright upon the eye and whiles away an hour</l>
                    <l>Glaring it rises from its leafy bed</l>
                    <l>And always seems as if to you it said.</l>
                    <l>I know that I am beautiful &#x0026; see</l>
                    <l>Whether a flower can compare with me</l>
                    <l>See my green leaves and see my head beside</l>
                    <l>With such a crimson such a glorious tide</l>
                    <l>That which another in thou canst not see</l>
                    <l>For not another flower is like me.</l>
                    <l>That the rose is a maiden fair tis true</l>
                    <l>And almost equals me But then judge you</l>
                    <l>Whether my darker colour doth not beat</l>
                    <l>Een that fair flowr where most beauties meet</l>
                    <l>Now say I Dost thou compare with the rose</l>
                    <l>Alas what flower itself really knows</l>
                    <l>That glaring crimson which you seem to like</l>
                    <l>Know that it glares too much unto the sight</l>
                    <l>While that fair flowr its maiden pink bestows</l>
                    <l>With such a sweetness as beseems the rose</l>
                    <l>Now sir hang down your head and dare no more</l>
                    <l>To put yourself the beauteous rose before</l>
                    <l>There is a tree &#x0026; famed it was of old</l>
                    <l>It used the brows of conq&#x02BC;rors to enfold</l>
                    <l>I need not name it Tis the tree of him</l>
                    <l>Who doth preside oer music and to sing</l>
                    <l>The God who did the Pythoness inspire</l>
                    <l>From the dark cavern with his sacred fire</l>
                    <l>As tis his tree it folds the poet&#x02BC;s brow</l>
                    <l>And is the tree of fame Enough of&#x02BC;t now.</l>
                    <l>High in the air the poplar nobly tow&#x02BC;rs</l>
                    <l>And seems for loftiness the King of flowrs</l>
                    <l>Its head contends to reach the clouds on high</l>
                    <l>And seems ambitious een to touch the sky.</l>
                    <l>Now the broad Oak displays its arms around</l>
                    <l>Its brawny branches spreading sweep the ground</l>
                    <l>Its kingly arms their giant strength display</l>

                    <l>Broad round the mother trunk they throw their arms</l>

                    <l>The spoils of nations come from their dread length</l>

                    <l>The British conquests have unbounded length</l>
                    <l>In vain the waves attempt to break their sides</l>
                    <l>And to oerwhelm them with the rushing tides</l>
                    <l>A copper armour keeps them safe below</l>
                    <l>They look down proud not frighted as they go</l>
                    <l>There the stern front the rushing sea divides</l>
                    <l>And towering high provokes the foaming tides</l>
                    <l>High at the stern they rear then sink below</l>
                    <l>Then rise again and then around they go</l>
                    <l>Foaming with rage that mortals should surmount</l>
                    <l>The wat&#x02BC;ry deep and sail the seas about</l>
                    <l>Unheeding of their rage the oak sails on</l>
                    <l>And Britons triumphing by seas are borne</l>

                    <l>I SING the pine which clothes high switzers head</l>
                    <l>And high enthroned grows on a rocky bed</l>
                    <l>On gulfs so deep on cliffs that are so high</l>
                    <l>He that would dare to climb them dares to die</l>
                    <l>There they hang oer the dreadful rocky steeps</l>
                    <l>There they bend over and they kiss the deeps</l>
                    <l>Which round the rocks do play and raging still</l>
                    <l>Awake the echoes from the wavy hill.</l>
                    <l>But man this pleasing picture soon would spoil</l>
                    <l>Regardless both of beauty and of toil</l>
                    <l>Though nature tried in vain to preserve them for a while</l>
                    <l>In vain to save them she did place them high</l>
                    <l>Alas in vain for they were doomed to die</l>
                    <l>Man formed a slide huge pond&#x02BC;rous to behold</l>
                    <l>It cost much labour and it cost much gold</l>
                    <l>Along the breast of Pilates cliff it lay</l>
                    <l>Oer rocks and gulfs and glens it held its way</l>
                    <l>And ended in Lucerne, on this the trees</l>
                    <l>Roaring like thunder borne upon the breeze</l>
                    <l>Rushed down and rushing dreadful in their ire</l>
                    <l>To their assistance such their anger dire</l>
                    <l>Summoned with red and flaming crown that monster fire</l>
                    <l>He then would have been king and on the mount</l>
                    <l>The flaming forests would have spread about</l>
                    <l>Another Etna Pilate would have been</l>
                    <l>Oer spacious <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName> the fires are seen</l>
                    <l>In one sad ruin all the pines would fall</l>
                    <l>In vain for help the noble forests call</l>
                    <l>But man had this foreseen. Ingenious man</l>
                    <l>Thought, can I this prevent. Yes if I will I can</l>
                    <l>And so man made the mountain streams descend</l>
                    <l>And down the trough their dang&#x02BC;rous course to bend</l>
                    <l>This element opposed the raging fire</l>
                    <l>And did prevent its great effects so dire</l>
                    <l>Now comes the hawthorn with its blossoms white</l>
                    <l>Welcoming gaily in Mays cheerful light</l>
                    <l>With luscious odours it perfumes the breeze</l>
                    <l>Most fair most cheerful sweetest of the trees</l>
                    <l>Bound up with clusters white it doth adorn</l>
                    <l>The tall pole which is raised on Mays first morn</l>
                    <l>And lightly bounding from the blooming green</l>
                    <l>Round it the village youth are dancing seen.</l>
                    <l>Dandily dressed with scarlet ribbons gay</l>
                    <l>The sweeps with hawthorn welcome in the may</l>
                    <l>With fluttering rags with yellow &#x0026; with red</l>
                    <l>And hawthorn blossoms waving oer their head</l>
                    <l>Rattling their shovels they do dance about</l>
                    <l>And think their robes are very fine no doubt.</l>
                    <l>And now the Yew a mournful tree I sing</l>
                    <l>Which pois&#x02BC;nous is to every living thing</l>
                    <l>And meet it is that such a tree is placed</l>
                    <l>In the dread church yard where the corses waste</l>
                    <l>Now think again in every case the Yew</l>
                    <l>Shows death in all its terrors to the view</l>
                    <l>For lo see there Just bursting from the wood</l>
                    <l>The free and lawless band of Robin Hood</l>
                    <l>Look at their bows tough Yew confines the string</l>
                    <l>And Yew elastic gives the arrow wing</l>
                    <l>Well aimed and thirsting for the purple blood</l>
                    <l>Of tallest stag that ever ranged the wood</l>
                    <l>The winged dart flies gladly through the air</l>
                    <l>And quickly fixes in its body fair</l>
                    <l>The tall stag fainteth with the deadly wound</l>
                    <l>And deeply sighing sinks upon the ground</l>
                    <l>And thus oppressed by the winged death</l>
                    <l>The dying stag sobs forth its latest breath</l>
                    <l>And now dost see yon ruined pile on high</l>
                    <l>Majestic creeping up against the sky</l>
                    <l>Behold the Ivy creeping oer the stone</l>
                    <l>Which still remains from Luxury thats gone</l>
                    <l>Where now foul weeds arise and tempests sweep</l>
                    <l>Oer the vast hall and tower &#x0026; donjon keep</l>
                    <l>In former times were feasts and blazing fires</l>
                    <l>And mirth and every thing the soul desires</l>
                    <l>Time hath flown by with mouldering touch hath past</l>
