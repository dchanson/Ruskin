                    <p>11. to 24 verse. VII. There is nothing more re&#x2010;
                    <lb/>markable in the annals of history, than 
                    <lb/>this grand operation of divine vengeance,
                    <lb/>both as a manifestation of <name type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">Gods</name> justice,
                    <lb/>&#x0026; of his detestation of sin, and of his power
                    <lb/>to punish it, except the sacrifice of his son.
                    <lb/>We propose contemplating this great cat&#x2010;
                    <lb/>astrophe, first in the preliminary circum&#x2010;
                    <lb/>stances, which led to it. We have seen in
                    <lb/>our previous observations, the vitiated, and 
                    <lb/>corrupt state of the children of men, im&#x2010;
                    <lb/>mediately before the flood. It is evident
                    <lb/>that they could not continue long in this 
                    <lb/>state, for the violence with which <!-- w<<[?]>>ich; h written over another letter --> they were
                    <lb/>filled, would certainly, at no very distant 
                    <lb/>period, have exterminated the human 
                    <lb/>race. But <name type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</name> declares, in the 3rd verse 
                    <lb/>of the 6th chapter, that he will aticipate 
                    <lb/>this extermination, My spirit shall 
                    <lb/>not always strive with man, yet his days 
                    <lb/>shall be an hundred and twenty years. 
                    <lb/>Various applications have been made, of the 
                    <lb/>number of years thus appointed, by <name type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</name>. 
                    <lb/>Some think that it refers to the time
                    <lb/>occupied in the construction of the Ark, 
                    <lb/>after <persName corresp="#NOAH">Noah</persName> had received the first annun&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ciation of the coming deluge; and others 
                    <lb/>consider, that it refers to the general period 
                    <lb/>of human life, which <del rend="strikethrough">was</del> appear to have 
                    <lb/>been greatly diminished, either immediate&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ly before or after the flood. But, I rather 
                    <lb/>think that it refers to neither of these 
                    <lb/>circumstances, but that it announces, 
                    <lb/>that one hundred, and twenty years, should be the period of human probation, that 
                    <lb/>this probation should not always be con&#x2010;
                    <lb/>tinued, that this time of strife and of
                    <lb/>violence, should at last be ended by a sig&#x2010;
                    <lb/>nal act of vengeance, We see, that no

                    <lb/>directions are given at present, for the im&#x2010;
                    <lb/>mediate construction of the ark, but that 
                    <lb/>there is, in the intervening period, ample 
                    <lb/>opportunity afforded to man, for repen&#x2010;
                    <lb/>tance, and amendment, which might 
                    <lb/>have been effected by the preaching of <persName corresp="#NOAH">Noah</persName> 
                    <lb/>for we have reason to believe, that <persName corresp="#NOAH">Noah</persName> did

                    <lb/>final catastrophe, they had, I say, the 
                    <lb/>diligent preaching of a faithful, and of 
                    <lb/>a righteous man, during a hundred and

                    <lb/>not abate, and thy continued in obsti&#x2010;

                    <lb/>that experiment to which they were sub

                    <lb/>something above their feeble capacities, some
                    <lb/>thing like the assistance, and the superin&#x2010;
                    <lb/>tendence, of an infinitely supreme, and pow
                    <lb/>erful being. but still, they would not believe, 
                    <lb/>they would not renounce any one of their 
                    <lb/>evil practices There remains yet another pre
                    <lb/>liminary to be mentioned, which, it might
                    <lb/>be supposed, would have worked with them 
                    <lb/>this was the entrance of the beasts and the 
                    <lb/>birds and the creeping things into the ark. 
                    <lb/>Through their obstinate infidelity, they might 
                    <lb/>have doubted if the ark which <persName corresp="#NOAH">Noah</persName> was 
                    <lb/>erecting, was in fact intended to preserve 
                    <lb/>him, and his family from the deluge, but 
                    <pb facs="296805v_0007"/>
                    <lb/>how was it possible, that they could doubt
                    <lb/>longer, when they saw the animal tribes 
                    <lb/>of their own accord gathering round and 
                    <lb/>entering into the ark, and that just in 
                    <lb/>the numbers, and in
                    <lb/>the order which <persName corresp="#NOAH">Noah</persName>
                    <lb/>had prescribed, I say, that they could, wit&#x2010;

                    <lb/>very strongest proofs on record, of the utter
                    <lb/>wickedness of the human soul. For had men,
                    <lb/>had human creatures only come to the ark,
                    <lb/>they might have suspected some combin
                    <lb/>ation to deceive them, into a belief in the
                    <lb/>ful{fil}ment of <persName corresp="#NOAH">Noahs</persName> threatenings, but in 
                    <lb/>the case of the brute creation, <del rend="strikethrough">there</del> it
                    <lb/>was evident there could be no combina&#x2010;

                    <lb/>And can we then wonder, that after

                    <lb/> been allow{e}d them for consideration
                    <lb/>and for repentance, and after that per

                    <p>We can scarcesly enter into the feelings
                    <lb/>which may be supposed to have actut&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ed the inhabitants of the antidiluvian crea
                    <lb/>tion, at this important period, We may
                    <lb/>however suppose, that even when the foun
                    <lb/>tains of the great deep were first broken
                    <pb facs="296805v_0008"/>
                    <lb/>up, and the windows of heaven were open,d, they
                    <lb/>would not admit that this was the com

                    <lb/>first manifestations, of the fulfilment of <!-- ~ stray pen mark? -->
                    <lb/>the prophecy. But by the time that the
                    <lb/>ark was floated, and the ocean was burst&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ing in upon them, their obstinate unbelief <!-- ~ stray pen mark? -->
                    <lb/>must at last give way to conviction, they
                    <lb/>believe, but it was now too late,
                    <lb/>The ark had departed, the waters, were
                    <lb/>fast encroaching upon them. and we

                    <p>When we consider, that when the waters

                    <lb/>ridges which they could possibly have atta

                    <lb/>parison of the multitudes with which they
                    <lb/>were crowded, and that these multitud
                    <lb/>es had long been inured to strife and mur

                    <lb/>for existence that must have taken place<!-- ~ at line break? --> 
                    <lb/>amid the madness of their despair</p>
                    <p>We must now consider and answer the
                    <lb/>principal objections, which have been brought
                    <lb/>forward by unbelief against the evidence
                    <lb/>of scripture, I would premise however

                    <lb/>should be remembered, that any profane
                    <lb/>history, which is in any degree well groun

                    <lb/>his family, and the ark, and the flood

                    <lb/>And in many of the ancient heathen

                    <lb/>is still more remarkable, the Mythol

                    <lb/>full of indistinct records. of the same

                    <lb/>that event took place, and we cannot

                    <p>It has also sometimes been objected, that the
                    <lb/>ark could not contain the number of ani

                    <lb/>which preserve all the species exist at the present time. And, in

                    <lb/>the amazing multitude of living beings
                    <lb/>which surround us, we might, perhaps,
                    <lb/>arrive at this inference. But, if we would

                    <lb/>that all the classes of animals may be
                    <lb/>reduced to a very few specimens, as it were
                    <lb/>the stamina<!-- footnote 2: See OED. "stamen" (2.b and 2.c) and "stamina." --> of the creation, from which
                    <lb/>common stocks[,] the different and lesser
                    <lb/>varieties, may be supposed to be derived
                    <lb/>and we shall then find, that a modern
                    <lb/>first rate line of battle ship, would be amp&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ly sufficient to contain both<!-- both<e> --> the requi&#x2010;

                    <lb/>There remains now to be answered, only one
                    <lb/>objection, of the least importance. We are
                    <lb/>told, in the 19, of the 7th, that all the high hills
                    <lb/>that were und{e}r the whole heaven, were co&#x2010;
                    <lb/>vered; Now, it may be asked, where could
                    <lb/>such a quantity of water be found, as,
                    <lb/>would thus fill the lowest vallies, and co&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ver the highest mountains. And, if the,
                    <lb/>common order of nature, would ever ad
                    <lb/>mit of such an event, why have we not
                    <lb/>a more frequent recurrence of it. Now, if
                    <lb/>we were to confine ourselves to the common
                    <lb/>and present order of things, this objection would
                    <lb/>be valid, But the deluge was, from its com&#x2010;
                    <lb/>mencement, <del rend="strikethrough">a</del><add type="overwrite">e</add>ntirly a miraculous operation,
                    <lb/>showing the extent of <name type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">Gods</name> indignation, a&#x2010;
                    <lb/>gainst sin, and, considering it thus, this
                    <lb/>phenomenon is no longer extraordinary, for
                    <lb/>the same power, which afterwards multiplied
                    <lb/>the loaves and fishes, could also have easily in&#x2010;
                    <lb/>creased the bulk of the waters, for, if <name type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</name> ma&#x2010;
                    <lb/>de. the whole, we must also allow that he guid&#x2010;

                    <lb/>on the summits<!-- HGV reads summit --> of the highest Mountains
                    <lb/>is another convincing evidence. Now lastly,
                    <lb/>if we consider the introduction, and o&#x2010;
