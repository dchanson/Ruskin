                        A Legend of Italy.
                        
                        The Lord of Castel Alto is old and gray - headed;
                        four - score years have flitted silently over him, and the
                        dream of his life is nigh to its awaking, and his ear is
                        dull , and his eye is dim, and his heart is weary.</p>
                        
                        <p>The old man reclines on a couch in the hall of his
                        ancestors, beside an open casement, and the balmy air
                        that floats over the deep blue waters of the broad sea ,
                        passes softly through his thin hair, and his weary eye
                        rests on the brightness of a lovely landscape ; for the
                        olive , and the orange , and the myrtle , are green by the
                        shore of the still waters ; and the city lies whitely
                        beneath the glance of the sun , as he rides through the
                        cloudless azure of the heaven ; while the purple
                        mountains clasp the ocean in their arms , and fade
                        away into the horizon in long lines of misty blue .
                        Alas ! the spring time of nature is a mockery to the
                        winter of age , and Amalfiero turns away in sadness .
                        His vassals are waiting around him to do him pleasure ;
                        the minstrel is there with his harp , the maiden with

                        her song ; but no music is so sweet to the old man's
                        ear as the voice of his daughter Giulietta .
                        Giulietta , when a babe , was a thing of smiles and
                        loveliness , like a happy thought dancing over the
                        mind . Giulietta , when a child , was like the orange
                        blossom in the groves of Friuli , and gladness floated
                        around her like the fragrance of the flower . Giulietta ,
                        in her youth , was the fairest maiden of Italy , - she
                        glanced among the myrtle bowers like the winged
                        zephyr : the evening star , when it rises gleaming
                        out of the sea into the darkness of the glorious night
                        of Italy , is not so bright as the beam that flashed from
                        her large ege through the night of her lovely eye-
                        lashes . Giulietta's mind was love - all love to each
                        and every thing .
                        Like music to the sadness of the soul , was Giulietta
                        to the old age of her father . As she passed before
                        him , a light came into the coldness of his eye ; and his
                        ear , when it was dead to other sound , awoke to the
                        murmur of her gentle voice . As an angel watches
                        over the last days of a saint upon the earth , when the
                        tumult of the battle of his life is over , and sheds
                        peace around his hours , and bids his days pass sweetly
                        and holily , so Giulietta watched over Amalfiero like an
                        influence of good , and was the sun of his thoughts ,
                        and the light of his rejoicing .
                        Giulietta had a brother . Garcio d'Amalfiero was a
                        man of a dark countenance , and the shadows of his
                        evil passions passed over it , like clouds over the
                        luridness of the stormy heaven , and his look withered
                        
                        those upon whom it fell , and his wrath , once excited ,
                        raged like a pestilence , and would not be appeased .
                        He was loved by few , and had many enemies , none of
                        whom he hated as he did the bandit Leoni , for him
                        only he feared.
                        Leoni's better nature had been borne down by the
                        violence of his passions, and he became what he ab-
                        horred, and widely was the fear of his name spread;
                        for he passed over the land like a meteor, and left de-
                        solation behind him in the palaces of the great and
                        the powerful, but not in the hamlets of the poor .
                        Returning from a successful attack on the castle of
                        a neighbouring baron , Leoni had been once tracked to
                        the fastnesses of the Apennines by Garcio , with
                        a chosen troop of his followers . The bandit gave him
                        battle , and was , as usual , victorious ; the followers of
                        Garcio cowered back from his thunderbolt charge , and
                        Garcio himself was struck from his horse by the sword
                        of Leoni . It had been said of the bandit , that he had
                        never deserted a friend , nor spared an enemy ; but , as
                        his sabre waved over the head of his prostrate foe ,
                        the beaver of Garcio's helmet fell open : Leoni's arm was
                        arrested as if by the hand of an invisible being , a
                        smile of scorn passed over his lip , and then a mildness
                        came into his eye ; he turned calmly away ; and , to
                        the astonishment of his followers , sounded a retreat in
                        the very flush of victory , while Garcio and his dis-
                        heartened and vanquished band were suffered to retire
                        unmolested . From that time the hatred of Garcio to
                        Leoni was inextinguishable . The shame of defeat ,
                        
                        and the thirst of revenge gnawed into his heart like
                        vultures , for he had rather have been laid dead by the
                        sword of Leoni , than have owed his life to the clemency
                        of his conqueror .
                       
                        * * * * *
                        
                        Giulietta sat in her chamber in the eastern tower of
                        Castel Alto . The evening star rose out of the sea ,
                        and climbed slowly up into the sky , and Giulietta's
                        dark eye rested sadly upon it . She was waiting for a
                        voice that rose , every evening , from the myrtle grove
                        below the castle , as that star disappeared behind the
                        peak of a distant mountain . Giulietta hardly knew how
                        very sweet the voice was to her listening ear , for it
                        was the voice of one who loved her with a more than
                        common love . They had first met when Giulietta was
                        young , very young , and Francesco just verging into
                        manhood - from that hour she was the light of his
                        path , and the joy of his heart . Her father knew
                        not of his child's love for Francesco , who pleaded
                        to Giulietta some ancient feud of their families , as an
                        excuse for maintaining his secresy .
                        When the star touched the misty summit of the
                        mountain , and Giulietta drew near to the window , a
                        blush passed over her fair cheek as a minstrel's song
                        rose upon the breeze .
                        
                        Full broad and bright is the silver light
                        Of moon and stars , on flood and fell ;
                        But in my breast is starless night ,
                        For I am come to say farewell .
                        
                        How glad , how swift was wont to be ,
                        The step that bore me back to thee ;
                        Now coldly comes upon my heart ,
                        The meeting that is but to part .
                        
                        “ I do not ask a tear , but while
                        I linger where I must not stay ,
                        0 , give me but a parting smile ,
                        To light me on my lonely way .
                        To shine , a brilliant beacon star ,
                        To my reverted glance , afar ,
                        Through midnight , which can have no morrow ,
                        O'er the deep , silent , surge of sorrow . ”
                        
                        Giulietta opened a secret door , and descended , and
                        Francesco saw her come forth in her beauty .
                        “What meant thy song to - night , Francesco ? ” said
                        the maiden .
                        “ What can a farewell to thee mean , Giulietta , but
                        misery ? "
                        " Nay , this is madness , Francesco , ” replied the
                        maiden , “ wherefore must we part ? ”
                        “ Thou sayest well , Giulietta , we will not part , -fly
                        with me , -night is on the mountains , my band is near .
                        Ere the day dawn we shall be far hence , in safety , in
                        honour , and — if thou wilt , in power . ”
                        " Thy band ! ” repeated Giulietta , “ fly with thee !
                        With whom ? What meanest thou ? What art thou ,
                        Francesco ? ”
                        “ I know not , maiden ! ” said Francesco , “ I have
                        
                        not been what I seem to be , yet thou couldst make
                        me so . With thee , I am Francesco ; without thee , I

                        And the name struck through to the maiden's heart
                        with a coldness as of death ; the cry she would have
                        uttered died upon her lips , and she fainted in the arms
                        of her lover .
                        A hectic flush passed over her cheek , and she woke
                        from the partial death with a deep gasp as of one in
                        pain , and her dark eye was filled with a vague horror .
                        “ Francesco , Francesco ! ” she said , “ thou toldest me
                        something , - it was terrible , tell it me again . Fran-
                        cesco ! -thou art not Francesco , " and she paused for a
                        moment . “ I know now , " she said ; “ I remember
                        well , very well , Francesco is dead , and thou — thou
                        art not , thou canst not , thou shalt not be Leoni , - the
                        bandit Leoni , - my brother's enemy . O , Francesco !
                        say thou mockest me ! "
                        “ I was once Leoni , ” he replied ; - “ thy brother's
                        enemy never , or Garcio had not now lived . Could I
                        be the enemy of your brother , Giulietta ? ”
                        And Giulietta felt that it was Francesco , and not
                        Leoni who spoke , and she paused in deep agony .
