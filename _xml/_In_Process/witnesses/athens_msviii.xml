                            O Persia they fell in fight with thee
                            When first thy proud thy angry monarch came
                            And Xerxes led his gallies oer the sea
                            To make the Grecian glory but a name
                            Then was not Greece forgetful of her fame
                            And first thou haughty one began thy woes
                            When thy unnumbered armament in vain
                            Her heroes to their countrys battle fight arose [fight written above battle]
                            And bent before <!--all--> old Greca her humbled foes
                                
                            VI
                            Little the young and mighty Xerxes thought
                            When first he counted all his myriads oer
                            And scarcely told their sum, a time how short
                            Should see him flying from the Grecian shore
                            And him the same who once nor long before
                            Had driven Scamander back unto his head
                            And dried his channel now one galley bore
                            His pride together with his power twas fled
                            And where his pristine glory? With the dead
                            VII
                            And such the force that Persias king could boast
                            Ay thousands millions myriads indeed
                            He might be proud who looked on such a host
                            And marked them for his own his eager steed
                            Pawing the ground impatient he might lead
                            That sea of plumes to battle  They were doomed
                            On deep Salamis ocean fields to bleed
                            And in its yawning gulph to be entombed
                            While the relentless wave above them boomed
                            VIII
                            They came the plumes upon their helmets dancing
                            Their young and eager monarch at their head
                            Their golden armour in the sunbeams glancing
                            A sea of bright translucent splendour shed
                            And earth all trembling shook beneath their tread
                            As when some gloomy vast and boundless deep
                            Heaps wave on wave with all its murmurs dread
                            Billow on billow with successive sweep
                            So pressed the warriors on a plumy foaming sheet
                            IX
                            They past, but on their track behind them prest
                            Riding upon the swift wings of the gale
                            The demon desolation  Horrid guest
                            Attending wars red footsteps. Famine pale
                            Did follow. Shrouded in his cloudy veil
                            Death like some lurking monster glaring down
                            All in his fiery chariot seemed to sail
                            And night back trembling started at the frown
                            That marked his bony brow, seared by his lightning crown
                            X
                            And is it thus that pomp and pageantry
                            Must leave behind them such a gloomy train
                            And must it be that purple luxury
                            And royal grandeur shall be all in vain
                            Is this that kingly pomp  But neer again
                            Shall Xerxes lead those legions  He shall mourn
                            The time for ever past with grief and shame
                            All oer the lonely deep from Graecia borne
                            And like an exile king unpitied and forlorn
                            XI
                            But leave my muse this melancholy lay
                            Full soon shalt thou resume the mournful knell
                            Alas too quickly comes the blood stained day
                            That weeps for heroes dead But take thy shell
                            And all in softer mellower numbers tell
                            Till flinty rocks shall list the flowing strain
                            What forces Xerxes led what heroes fell
                            Those chieftains birth and eke from whence they came
                            Their fathers ancient deeds their lineage and their name

                            Thy parents came not of a kingly line
                            For oh a long futurity shall show
                            That natures proud nobility was thine
                            And not ancestral honours drowned in time
                            A mighty mind as innocent as pure
                            That through the mists of lowliness would shine
                            Humble not abject, rich although obscure
                            He had a virtuous mind the riches of the poor4
                            XIII
                            He had a brother.5 They were kindred souls
                            For they were twins in age and mind the same
                            And where the wave of bright Hydaspes rolls
                            The Indian stream that gave to him his name
                            They learned the tigers savageness to tame
                            Or the dread hooded serpents folds to press
                            When hissed her head on high with eyes of flame
                            And as before them fled the lioness
                            Fearless and scatheless walked the wilderness
                            XIV
                            And they had trod the stormy mountains ridge
                            To all the tribes of man a mighty bar
                            Or on the cliffs upraised and giddy edge
                            Looked down triumphant on the scene afar
                            Where the proud battlements of many a scar
                            Confusedly rising round them clove the sky
                            Where nature seemed to wage a mountain war
                            Long time they often lingered upon high
                            Where the snow wreaths hung round eternally
                            XV
                            And hordes they led as swift as is the breeze
                            That flies across the oceans foam so light
                            Or as the mountain elk that challenges
                            The Scythian arrow to outstrip his flight
                            But firm and slow retreating from the fight
                            Strong as their native lion bathed in gore
                            Pawing the earth exulting in his might
                            And the wide forest echoing to his roar
                            Like sound of winter waves that bellow on the shore
                            XVI
                            And he the born upon the battle field
                            Young Moriartes6 who upon a heap
                            Of gory corses on a warriors shield
                            Resting while war was raging round did sleep
                            High pillowed on the crest of that famed steep
                            That looks on Marathon with infant eye
                            Saw the rude tide of battle onwards sweep
                            As on the rugged mountain he did lie
                            And born in Greece in Greece was doomed to die
                            XVII
                            (O Marathon thou field of victory
                            If ever Greece should cease to be a slave
                            Let her look back to ancient deeds and sigh
                            For loss of glory which her fathers gave
                            Bought with their noble lives or will her brave
                            Burst from the fetters of the narrow bed
                            Breaking the sods which clasp their gory grave
                            And tell old Greece that they for her have bled
                            And deep reproaching her forgetful of the dead7
                            XVIII
                            Oh if this sad and simple lay of mine
                            Could give thee down unto posterity
                            Thou should’st have ridden on the wings of time
                            And only with creations self should die
                            Let not thy parent oer thine ashes sigh
                            For thou shalt live through many distant days
                            Though neath the ocean now thy corse may lie
                            Again thy name shall shine in future lays
                            And harps of nobler string record a warriors praise

                            His was a <!--mighty--> gloomy and sequestered mind
                                Men say that on the night when he was born
                                There was a strange sad sighing in the wind
                                And many an ominous and awful form
                                Rode the dark clouds that bore the bursting storm
                                As the red lightning those wide heavens spanned 
                                And sounds of wailing as of those that mourn
                                Ever for the dead and many a spectre hand
                                Seemed lifting high the [(?)] battle brand 
                                20
                                His was a soul of solitude His ear
                                Liked not the hum of thousands He would pace
                                (At midnight when the azure heavens were clear
                                The paths of some wild desert wilderness
                                As if his soul would haste to seek its place
                                Winging its <!--way through--> vast and its aerial way
                                    To that bright home of light and loveliness9
                                    Breaking the bands of its confining clay
                                    That shackled it on earth and haste to spring away
                                    2110
                                    There was a sad and settled gloominess
                                    That brooded oer his features, and if eer
                                    He smiled twas not <!--the--> a smile of happiness
                                        He never could forget the secret care
                                        That weighed upon his bosom rooted there
                                        Too deep for consolation <!--One young boy [these(?) . . . wild(?)]--> One young <!--child--> boy
                                            Had followed him from far and he would share

                                                    The sunset shone upon the isles of Greece
                                                    And ocean where the heavens misty blue
                                                    Was mingling with the deep which lay, in peace
                                                    Far to the west its world of waters threw
