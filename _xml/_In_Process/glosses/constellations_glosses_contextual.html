Viewed at meridian from <span class="placeName">London</span> in January, and visible January–April, November–December. In his <span class="titlem">“Calendarium Stellaris”</span> for January (mid‐month, 9:30 P.M.), <span class="persName">Aspin</span> highlights <span class="name">Orion</span> as “nearly on the meridian; and below him . . . <span class="name">Lepus (the Hare)</span> and <span class="name">Columba Noachi (Noahʼs Dove)</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Aspin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 106, 146, 161). Included among the forty‐eight constellations listed by <span class="persName">Ptolemy</span> in the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Almagest</span></span>.</p> 
               <p>According to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs geography text, “<span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Orion</span></span>, containing his Sword and luminous Belt”, is considered one of the “most remarkable”
                  constellations “to the naked eye or telescope”, along with “<span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Taurus</span></span>, containing the <span class="name">Pleiades</span>; and <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Ursa Major</span></span>, containing the <span style="font-style:italic">Pointers</span> to the <span class="name">North Star</span>: all visible in our winter evenings” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GOLDSMITHGEOGRAPHY"><span class="persName">Goldsmith</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Grammar of General Geography</span></span></a>, 8). Situated south of <span class="name">Taurus (the Bull)</span> and <span class="name">Gemini (the Twins, <span class="persName">Castor</span> and <span class="persName">Pollux</span>)</span>, which are constellations in the <span class="name">zodiac</span>, <span class="name">Orion</span> is viewed along the celestial equator, below the ecliptic. In the northern hemisphere,
                  it rises low on the eastern horizon during winter evenings and transits westward.</p> 
               <p>Among the most anciently named constellations, <span class="name">Orion</span> is mentioned, for example, in <span class="persName">Homer</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Odyssey</span></span> as one of the constellations that guide <span class="persName">Odysseus</span> (bk. 5), and he also appears to <span class="persName">Odysseus</span> among the dead in the underworld (bk. 11). In mythology, <span class="persName">Orion</span> is a great hunter. He “is represented on the globe by the figure of a man with a
                  sword in his belt, a club in his right hand, and the skin of a lion in his left; he
                  is said by some authors to be the son of <span class="persName">Neptune</span> and <span class="persName">Euryale</span>, a famous huntress; he possessed the disposition of his mother, became the greatest
                  hunter in the world, and boasted that there was not any animal on the <span class="name">earth</span> which he could not conquer”. However, “as a punishment for his temerity”, “in the
                  island of <span class="placeName">Crete</span>, accompanied by <span class="persName">Diana</span> and <span class="persName">Latona</span> in the chase, . . . he perished by the bite of a scorpion” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 53). Accordingly, “he was placed among the stars, in a position directly opposite
                  to that of the <span class="name">Scorpion</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 69; see <a class="link_ref" href="#SCORPIOGLOSS" title="High up there is scorpio (MS IA RF T70 MS III)Scorpio (Scorpion) constellation of the southern Zodiac the second southern and s...">Scorpio</a>; and for other tales about the death of <span class="name">Orion</span>, see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 135).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Aspin</span> adds a biblical type, <span class="name">Orion</span> as the “representative of <span class="persName">Nimrod</span>, that ‘mighty hunter’, who is supposed to have been the author of the postdiluvian
                  heresy” (<span class="titlem">Gen. 10:8–9</span>; for <span class="persName">Nimrod</span> as a warrior king who cast off fear of <span class="persName">God</span> by shedding human blood and by organizing a great metropolis crowned by the <span class="placeName">Tower of Babel</span>, see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SCOTTBIBLE"><span class="titlem">Holy Bible</span>, ed. <span class="persName">Scott</span></a>, 1:62, 64). <span class="persName">Aspin</span> also mocks an unsuccessful attempt by “French astronomers” to “change the name of
                  this constellation to that of <span class="persName">Napoleon</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 147; for the <span class="orgName">University of Leipzig</span>ʼs flattery of <span class="persName">Napoleon</span> in <span class="date">1807</span>, following the Treaties of Tilsit ending the War of the <span class="orgName">Fourth Coalition</span>, by naming <span class="name">Orion</span>ʼs belt and sword after the emperor, see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ALLENSTARNAMES"><span class="persName">Allen</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Names</span></span></a>, 315).</p>

The iconography of seating the Olympian gods on thrones may have been most
                  familiar to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> from the synod of the gods in book 15 of <span class="persName">Homer</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Iliad</span></span>, which he knew in <span class="persName">Pope</span>ʼs translation.

                  the rising groan” (bk. 15, lines 141, 160–61). This passage also pertains to the association
                  of <span class="persName">Mars</span> and <span class="persName">Venus</span> (Aphrodite), <span class="persName">Juno</span> having conspired with <span class="persName">Venus</span> in book 14 to distract <span class="persName">Jupiter</span> from the battlefield with love‐making and sleep (<span class="persName">Homer</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Iliad</span></span>, trans. <span class="persName">Pope</span>, 307, and see 303–7, 292–97).

               <p>Turning back from a planet to the constellations, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> begins with the largest northern circumpolar constellation, <span class="name">Ursa Major (the Great Bear)</span>, which contains the oblong configuration of four stars also known as the <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Plough</span></span> or <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Charlesʼs Wain</span></span>, with another three stars forming its “team” of horses. Considered as part of the
                  larger constellation, the seven stars “form a quadrilateral figure in the back of
                  the Bear; the other three stars project from one of the angles in a curved line, and
                  constitute the tail”; however, the seven stars “occupy but a small part of the whole
                  constellation, which is one of the most extensive in the heavens” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 23).</p>

                  As <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Tutor</span> explains, “if you wish to be a young astronomer”, a youth “must learn to find these
                  [cardinal compass] points without the assistance of the <span class="name">sun</span>”; and he directs their eyes to “those seven stars which are in the constellation
                  of the <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Great Bear</span></span>”, which “some people have supposed . . . aptly represent a <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">plough</span></span>; others say, that they are more like a <span style="font-style:italic">waggon and horses;</span>—the four stars representing the body of the waggon, and the other three the horses”

               <p>Among the oldest named constellations in classical sources familiar to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, the <span class="name">Great Bear</span> is mentioned along with <span class="name">Orion</span> by <span class="persName">Homer</span> in the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Odyssey</span></span> (bk. 5) as ever‐present in the sky, never bathing in the sea. <span class="persName">Aspin</span> remarks “[i]ts use . . . by mariners from the earliest times that commerce has been

The best‐known story in western classical poetry about the <span class="name">Great Bear</span> is told by <span class="persName">Ovid</span> in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Metamorphoses</span></span>.

                  that her father <span class="persName">Cepheus</span> might still preserve his kingdom. <span class="persName">Perseus</span> turned the monster into a rock by shewing it the head of <span class="persName">Medusa</span>, and thus rescued <span class="persName">Andromeda</span>, whom he immediately took to wife, as the reward of her patriotism and filial piety”
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 19–20).</p> 
               <p>In the first fair copy of his poem, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> scored through <span class="name">Medusaʼs Head</span> perhaps because the legend was deemed too gruesome for the Ruskin household. In illustrations
                  of <span class="name">Perseus et Caput Medusae</span> from the <span class="date">1820s</span>, <span class="persName">Green</span>ʼs artist tempers the horror by representing <span class="name">Perseus</span> holding the head of <span class="persName">Medusa</span> by her human hair, from which only a few serpents protrude, and the artist gives
                  her face a mild expression. In contrast, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Perseus</span> grips the head by its mass of writing serpents, and its face is fixed in its dangerous
                  gaze. The effect was not moderated when the plate was adapted for <span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span>, in which <span class="persName">Medusa</span>ʼs glare is even more sinister (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, pl. 4; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, pl. 3; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHURANIASMIRROR"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem">“Uraniaʼs Mirror”</span></a>, pl. 6).</p> 
               <p>To replace <span class="name">Caput Medusae</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> did not immediately shift his attention to the larger constellation, <span class="name">Perseus</span>, which appears later in the poem.

               <p>Here, in place of <span class="name">Medusaʼs Head</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> turned to a nearby northern constellation, <span class="name">Telescopium Herschelii (<span class="persName">Herschel</span>ʼs Telescope)</span>, which was a comparatively recent creaton, and which suggested the modernity of science
                  rather than ancient blood feuds. This constellation is now obsolete, but, in the <span class="date">first half of the 1820s</span>, it was acknowledged by <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="persName">Aspin</span>, and <span class="persName">Green</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 22; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Aspin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 105, 117–18; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 33).</p> 
               <p><span class="name">Telescopium Herschelii</span> was created in <span class="date">1789</span> by the Hungarian astronomer, <span class="persName">Maximilian Hell</span> (<span class="date">1720–92</span>), who devised it from “a few of the stars of <span class="name">Auriga [the Charioteer]</span>. . . . It is intended to perpetuate the name of <span class="persName">Herschell [William Herschel, <span class="date">1738–1822</span>]</span> and the form of the instrument by which he discovered the planet <span class="name">Uranus</span> in the year <span class="date">1781</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 33). It is bounded on the north and east by <span class="name">Lynx</span>, on the south by <span class="name">Gemini</span>, and on the west by <span class="name">Auriga</span>. It appears “always above the horizon of <span class="placeName">London</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Aspin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 105, 118).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Ridpath</span> explains that <span class="persName">Hell</span> originally created two constellations commemorating <span class="persName">Herschel</span> telescopes, which were reduced to one by <span class="persName">Johann Bode</span> in <span class="date">1801</span>. Presumably, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> intended <span class="name">Telescopium Herschelii</span>, and not yet another constellation on the same theme, <span class="name">Telescopium (Telescope)</span>, which is a small formation in the southern hemisphere, and which remains an officially
                  recognized constellation today. It was created by the French astronomer, <span class="persName">Nicolas‐Louis de Lacaille</span> (<span class="date">1713–62</span>); and while there is no way to prove <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs intent, it is reasonable to assume that he meant to celebrate the constellation
                  honoring the British astronomer (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 205–6, 167–68).</p>

               <p><span class="name">Vulcepula et Anser</span> was introduced by the Polish astronomer, <span class="persName">Johannes Hevelius</span> (<span class="date">1611–87</span>), who depicted it as a fox with a goose captured in its jaws. The haplessness of
                  the bird may account for <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs epithet of “stupid”, but by dividing the constellation in two <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> also avoids drawing attention to the gooseʼs fate. A precedent for separating the
                  fox from the goose extends back to <span class="persName">Hevelius</span> himself, who named the constellation both as a single entity, <span class="name">Vulpecula <span style="font-style:italic">cum</span> Anser</span>, and as two distinct entities, which were afterward sometimes reunited as <span class="name">Vulpecula <span style="font-style:italic">et</span> Anser</span>.

               <p>Perhaps a predatory and carnivorous fox offended nineteenth‐century sensibility, since
                  both <span class="persName">Aspin</span> and <span class="persName">Green</span> omit any mention of what is happening to the goose. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> not only separates the constellations, but also places <span class="name">Lepus (the Hare)</span> between them. If he intended to shield the <span class="name">goose</span> from the <span class="name">fox</span>, however, he undercut the effort by giving the <span class="name">hare</span> the epithet “timid” (“frightened” in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>). Similarly, his epithet for the <span class="name">goose</span>, “stupid”, robs the disadvantaged of sympathy, just as an implied parallel between
                  the <span class="name">Goose</span> and <span class="name">Medusa</span> and between the <span class="name">Fox</span> and <span class="name">Perseus</span> suggests a justified fate.</p>

               <p>The stars of the <span class="name">Southern Cross</span> were known to <span class="persName">Ptolemy</span>, but he considered them as part of <span class="name">Centaurus</span> in his catalogue of forty‐eight constellations. As <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> explains, although visible to the ancient Mediterranean world, the stars were lost
                  to view in the north owing to precession in the <span class="name">Earth</span>ʼs rotational axis. For Europeans, the stars were rediscovered and charted by explorers
                  sailing south in the <span class="date">sixteenth century</span>, and <span class="name">Crux</span> came to be used by navigators since its axis points to the <span class="geogName">South Pole</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 84–85).

After <span class="persName">Charles II</span> was restored to the throne, the purpose of his astronomer, <span class="persName">Halley</span>, in traveling to <span class="placeName">St. Helena</span> was, like the Frenchman <span class="persName">Lacaille</span> on his mission, to survey the southern sky, and he published his star catalogue,

               <p>Of the three southern constellations that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> sequentially names—<span class="name">Crux</span>, <span class="name">Robur Carolinum</span>, and <span class="name">Crater</span>—only the last is visible from <span class="placeName">London</span>. While <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs inclusion of the first two can be attributed to his piety and a sentiment for British
                  associations, his choice of <span class="name">Crater</span> seems arbitrary. Perhaps he was tracing a path toward the northern hemisphere, since
                  <span class="name">Crater</span> is situated roughly north of <span class="name">Charlesʼs Oak</span>.</p> 
               <p>According to a myth that connects <span class="name">Crater</span> with nearby <span class="name">Corvus</span> and <span class="name">Hydra</span>, <span class="persName">Apollo</span> gave the Cup to <span class="name">Corvus (Crow)</span> to fetch water. The Crow procrastinated, attempting to cover up his delay by blaming

Detecting the lie, <span class="persName">Apollo</span> tossed the <span class="name">Cup</span>, the <span class="name">Water‐serpent</span>, and <span class="name">Crow</span> into the heavens, where <span class="name">Hydra</span> perpetually prevents <span class="name">Crow</span> from drinking from the vessel (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Aspin</span></a>, 152; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 82–83).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Jamieson</span> relates this tale in connection with <span class="name">Hydra</span>, limiting his account of <span class="name">Crater</span> to its appearance with with the ancient summer solstice, thus evoking a “fable which

Although these multiple legends and associations differ widely from one another,
                  none involves <span class="persName">Juno (Hera)</span>. It remains unexplained, then, why <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> declares: “Iʼll call it <span class="persName">juno</span>ʼs cup”. Perhaps he did not know a legend or avoided one he knew.</p>

               <p>In hi drawing of <span class="name">Hercules</span>, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> “endeavoured to combine” attributes of the heroʼs labors, which previous star maps
                  associated separately with the figure, by placing in the grip of the left hand the
                  “Apple Branch” of the <span class="placeName">Hesperides</span> coiled together with the three‐headed, dog‐faced <span class="name">Cerberus</span>. In the figureʼs right hand, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> retained the traditional club; and as a touch of his own, he “added the bow and quiver

                  to form the constellation <span class="name">Cerberus et Ramus</span>, which then was placed in <span class="name">Hercules</span>ʼs hand by <span class="persName">Johann Bode</span> in his <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span></span> (<span class="date">1801</span>) (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 190). <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs splendid culmination of these representations was copied, however, by <span class="persName">Aspin</span>ʼs and <span class="persName">Green</span>ʼs artists with decreasing specificity—the <span class="name">Cerberus</span> in the <span class="titlem">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span> illustration losing its canine features; and the plagiarized beast in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span> losing even its serpentine fierceness, the apple branch its apples, and <span class="name">Hercules</span> his archery gear.</p> 
               <p>In his prose account, <span class="persName">Green</span> unpacks the emblems: “It is stated by the mythologists, that [<span class="persName">Hercules</span>] brought upon <span class="name">earth</span> the three‐headed monster <span class="name">Cerberus</span>, which guarded the entrance to <span class="persName">Pluto</span>ʼs dominions. The victory which he obtained over <span class="name">Cerberus</span>, is thought by some to denote his control over his bad passions; for he is held out
                  by the ancients as a pattern of virtue and piety. His judicious choice of virtue,
                  in preference to pleasure, is admirably described by <span class="persName">Xenophon</span>”. As for the “Hesperidian branch, bearing the golden apples”, that story “is probably
                  of a more ancient date”, <span class="persName">Hercules</span> “procur[ing] some of these golden apples from the <span class="placeName">Hesperides</span>, by killing the <span class="name">Dragon [Draco]</span>”, which is nearby in the sky. Also, “the skin of a <span class="name">lion</span> covers his head and shoulders.

               <p><span class="persName">Ridpath</span> explains that the name “probably comes from a Greek word meaning ‘noisy’ or ‘clamorous’,
                  referring to the herdsmanʼs shouts to his animals”; or, linking the etymology to <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span> inside <span class="name">Ursa Major</span>, the name is a word “from the ancient Greek meaning ‘ox‐driver’”. According to a
                  legend in <span class="persName">Eratosthenes</span> similar to a story associated with Ursa Minor, the constellation “represents <span class="persName">Arcas</span>, son of the god <span class="persName">Zeus</span> and his paramour <span class="persName">Callisto</span>, daughter of <span class="persName">King Lycaon</span> of <span class="placeName">Arcadia</span>”.

                  . . . <span class="persName">Zeus</span> snatched up <span class="persName">Arcas</span> and his mother and placed them in the sky as the constellations of the bear‐keeper

               <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> appears to have returned to the southern hemisphere of constellations, drawn again
                  seemingly by British sentiment (see also <a class="link_ref" href="#CRUXGLOSS" title="the blessed cross (RF T70 MS III)Unless Ruskin mistook as a separate constellation what is often called the Cross or Northern C..."><span class="name">Crux [the Southern Cross]</span></a> and <span class="name">Robur Carolinum [Charlesʼs Oak]</span>). In this case, however, the identification of his sentiment with an English name,
                  the <span style="font-style:italic">Swallow</span>, puts in doubt what constellation he intended. The name “swallow” appears in the
                  first draft, <span class="titlem">MS IA</span>, and in the fair copy, <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>. In the latter, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> struck through the name and substituted “sweet hirundo” (<span style="font-style:italic">hirundo</span> is the Latin name for the species including swallows), which he carried over to the
                  final fair copy, <span class="titlem">MS III</span>. Neither of these names, <span style="font-style:italic">swallow</span> nor <span style="font-style:italic">hirundo</span>, is used either in todayʼs star charts or in <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs chart published in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs time.</p> 
               <p>The names <span style="font-style:italic">Swallow</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Hirundo</span> did have currency, a constellation called “Hirundo, the Swallow” appearing, e.g.,
                  in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">An Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children</span> (<span class="date">1817</span>)</span> by <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> (<span class="date">1775–1851</span>). It is listed under the heading “The New Constellations to the South of the Ecliptic”,
                  before <span class="name">“Grus, the Crane”</span> and after <span class="name">“Indus, the Indian”</span>, although the ordering of constellation names in <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs columns may not be significant (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Sherwood</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Introduction to Astronomy</span></span></a>, 17). According to <span class="persName">Richard Hinckley Allen</span>, the constellation <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Apus</span></span> may have acquired the name the <span style="font-style:italic">Swallow</span> by way of the common English name for <span class="persName">Linnaeus</span>ʼs species name, <span style="font-style:italic">Hirundo apus</span>, which is also applied to the swift‐birds associated with the approach of summer
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ALLENSTARNAMES"><span class="persName">Allen</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Names</span></span></a>, 44). As a gloss for <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs listing, however, <span class="persName">Allen</span>ʼs explanation is contradicted by her <span style="font-style:italic">separate</span> listing of <span class="name">“Apus, or Avis Indica, the Bird of Paradise”</span>, which appears at the end of the list, following <span class="name">“Triangulum Australe, the Southern Triangle”</span>. If <span class="persName">Allen</span> is correct that <span style="font-style:italic">Hirundo apus</span> became confused with the constellation name, <span class="name">Apus</span>, it is understandable that <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> would nonetheless have decided that a constellation named after the common English
                  <span class="name">swallow</span> could be the same constellation known as <span class="name">Apus</span> or <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Apus Indica</span></span> or (in English) <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Bird of Paradise</span></span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 63, pl. 28). A probable conclusion, then, is that <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> doubled the same constellation under two different names, and that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, insofar as he understood what he meant at all, was pointing to <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Apus</span></span> in the southern hemisphere.</p> 
               <p>The constellation <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Apus, or Apus Indica</span></span>, which is associated with the family of exotic birds commonly known as <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">birds of paradise</span></span>, was one among twelve southern constellations introduced to European sky charts in
                  the <span class="date">late sixteenth century</span>, based on observations of the sky south of the equator by the Dutch navigators, <span class="persName">Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser</span> and <span class="persName">Frederick de Houtman</span>. The name <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Apus</span></span> was derived from the Greek for <span style="font-style:italic">without foot</span>, since, as <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> explains, specimens originally obtained from <span class="placeName">New Guinea</span> by Europeans were skins from which the birdsʼ feet had been removed, leading to speculation
                  that these fabulous birds, with their long and colorful plummage, remained permanently
                  in flight (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 41).</p>

                  new constellation, he wrote, “would need the eyesight of a <span class="name">lynx</span>”, Yet the “unformed” stars (i.e., stars not formed into a constellation) from which

In <span class="placeName">London</span>, <span class="name">Leo</span> “rises in the E.N.E. and may be viewed in the evenings of January to May”, according

Listed by <span class="persName">Ptolemy</span> among the forty‐eight constellations in the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Almagest</span></span>.</p> 
               <p>As a trio of <span class="name">Zodiac</span> signs sequentially named by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, <span class="name">Lynx</span>, <span class="name">Scorpio</span>, and <span class="name">Leo</span> seem connected mainly by the ferocity of the beasts they represent. As <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> comments regarding <span class="name">Leo</span>, “[p]opular tradition represents the <span class="name">Lion</span>, an animal remarkable for his fierceness and strength, as emblematical of the <span class="name">Sun</span>ʼs heat at this period of the year”, advanced summer. The <span class="name">sun</span> enters <span class="name">Leo</span> on July 23 (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 40). <span class="persName">Aspin</span> points out that, “chiefly situated north of the ecliptic”, it “passes over the countries
                  situated in the north part of the torrid zone, where lions are generally found” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 135).</p> 
               <p>Mythologically, <span class="name">Leo</span> is associated with the terrible <span class="name">Lion of <span class="placeName">Nemea</span></span>, which <span class="persName">Hercules</span> defeated as the first of his twelve labors. After <span class="persName">Hercules</span> was successful, he made a cloak of the Lionʼs skin, which was said to be impervious
                  to weapons, and the lionʼs head of the cloak rested atop <span class="persName">Hercules</span>ʼs own head (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 112). In his <span class="titlem">plate 8</span>, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> shows <span class="persName">Hercules</span> with this cloak, capped by the lionʼs head.</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs first epithet, “king”, as drafted in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> and fair‐copied in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, is more appropriate to <span class="name">Leo</span>ʼs mythological associations than his second epithet, “generous”, as substituted in
                  <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> and fair‐copied in <span class="titlem">MS III</span>. In the latter choice, perhaps <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> conveyed how he wished to think about <span class="placeName">England</span>, given the nationʼs heraldic uses of the lion.</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Green</span> uses the constellation to highlight the <span class="titlem">Zodiac of Dendera</span>, an artifact removed from an ancient building by <span class="persName">Napoleon</span>ʼs agents during the campaign in <span class="placeName">Egypt</span>, and brought to <span class="placeName">Paris</span> to be installed in the <span class="orgName">Royal Library</span> (<span class="persName">Green</span> says the <span class="placeName">Louvre</span>) in <span class="date">1822</span>. <span class="persName">Green</span> notes that the constellations carved on the disk start from <span class="name">Leo</span>, rather than from <span class="name">Aries</span>, normally treated as the first sign of the <span class="name">Zodiac</span> owing to its association with the vernal equinox. Writing on the constellation <span class="name">Aries</span>, <span class="persName">Green</span> is skeptical of “those who are desirous of drawing from every source an argument
                  against the chronology of the <span class="titlem">Bible</span>, that these <span class="name">zodiacs</span> were constructed when the <span class="name">sun</span> entered the sign <span class="name">Leo</span>, which must have been more than ten thousand years before the birth of our <span class="persName">Saviour</span>”. In his skepticism about the challenges that archaeology poses to literal interpretation
                  of Scripture, <span class="persName">Green</span> aligns himself with the views of <span class="persName">Thomas Chalmers</span> (<span class="date">1780–1847</span>): “There are, perhaps, no opinions more diametrically opposed to each other, than
                  those of theorizing antiquaries. On almost every important question the contending
                  parties, in point of numbers and reputation, neutralize themselves; and what <span class="persName">Dr. Chalmers</span> has said in his <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evidences of Christianity</span></span> relative to speculating geologists, may justly be applied to them. ‘Though our imaginations
                  have been regaled by the brilliancy of their speculations, they are so opposite to
                  each other, that we now cease to be impressed by their evidence’” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 76, 64–65).</p> 
               <p>In <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Discourses on the Christian Revelation Viewed in Connection with the Modern Astronomy</span></span> (<span class="date">1817</span>), <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> sought to refute skeptical arguments that the evidence of astronomy undermines the
                  truth of Christian revelation. A copy of the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Discourses</span></span> was in the Ruskin family library (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><span class="persName">Dearden</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Library of John Ruskin</span></span></a>, 67 [no. 473]). <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> instead proposes, according to <span class="persName">David Cairns</span>, “such a relevance between the knowledge which the sciences present to us”—even the
                  presentiment by modern astronomy of a forbiddingly vast and violent universe—and the
                  convictions of faith that, in <span class="persName">Cairns</span>ʼs estimation, the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Discourses</span></span> constitute a natural theology (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#CAIRNSCHALMERSASTRONOMICAL"><span class="titlem">“Thomas Chalmersʼ Astronomical Discourses”</span></a>, 417).</p> 
               <p>While an academic scientist like <span class="persName">Green</span> could align himself with a natural theology as articulated by <span class="persName">Chalmers</span>, evangelicals—especially Scottish evangelicals, like <span class="persName">Chalmers</span>—were not receptive to a natural theology in the optimistic style presented by <span class="persName">William Paley (<span class="date">1743–1805</span>)</span>. As <span class="persName">Jonathan R. Topham</span> argues, while many evangelicals remained open to a “theology of nature” that advocated
                  “a rational religion that would attract the cultured middle classes”, they maintained “a scriptural and soteriological emphasis distinct from the largely ethical emphasis” of
                  Paleyan natural theology, with its evidences of a <span class="persName">Creator</span> conceived as a benevolent watchmaker. <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> himself arrived at this emphasis following a transformative conversion experience,
                  which resulted in an essay widely disseminated in <span class="date">1814</span> as <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evidence and Authority of the Christian Revelation</span></span>—the text mentioned by <span class="persName">Green</span> as his lodestar. In it, <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> pursues an inductive Baconian “science of theology . . . based strictly on historical evidence. 
                  This comprised chiefly the ‘external evidence’ of the truth of the Christian revelation (the miracles and prophecies attending it), 
                  but also included . . . the ‘internal evidence’, namely the ‘marks of truth’ in the <span class="titlem">New Testament</span> considered as a human composition,  and the evidence provided by the text as to the character of its authors. These inferences were sound, he argued, since they were based on observations of human nature, of which people have much empirical experience”.
                  By comparison, <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> considered a Paleyan natural theology that judged “the truth of <span class="orgName">Christianity</span> on the reasonableness of its doctrines,  or any supposed agreement between the nature of the Christian religion and the character of the supreme being”
                  to be reliant  “on a priori speculation, and . . . consequently strictly anti‐Baconian and unscientific”.
                  We have “no experience whatever” of the “invisible <span class="persName">God</span>”, he argued, and his government must consequently be a subject “inaccessible to our faculties”
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#TOPHAMCHALMERS"><span class="persName">Topham</span>, <span class="titlem">“Science, Natural Theology, and Evangelicalism in Early Nineteenth‐Century Scotland”</span></a>, 144, 149, 155).</p> 
               <p>This method of turning the tables of scientific rigor on the moderates and the skeptics
                  is maintained in the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Discourses</span></span>, <span class="persName">Topham</span> remarks, despite these lecturesʼ apparent kinship with natural theology. Ultimately,
                  <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> concludes, the “sense of wonder engendered by contemplation of the astonishing phenomena of astronomy had no power to impel .
                  . . to true religion.  Even if such contemplation could lead an atheist to a belief in ‘the design and authority of a great presiding Intelligence’”,
                  <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> wrote, “it could never by itself lead him to obedience to the divine will, or humble him ‘to acquiesce in the doctrine of that revelation which comes to his door with such a host of evidence, 
                  as even his own philosophy cannot bid away’. It was ‘only by insisting on the moral claim of <span class="persName">God</span> to a right of government over His creatures’  that the preacher could carry his hearers to ‘loyal submission to the will of <span class="persName">God</span>. Let him keep by this single argument’, <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> insisted,  ‘and then . . . he may bring convincingly home upon his hearers all the varieties of <span class="orgName">Christian</span> doctrine’. In his insistence that the preacherʼs appeal to the human conscience was essential to impel the atheist to consider the historical evidences”,
                  <span class="persName">Topham</span> summarizes, “and in his insistence that this argument was infinitely more powerful than any argument from external nature, we see a clear indication of <span class="persName">Chalmers</span>ʼs developing views” toward a rational religion consistent with his evangelicalism

               <p>The constellation was invented in <span class="date">1612</span> by a Dutch theologian and astronomer, <span class="persName">Petrus Plancius</span>, who used the giraffeʼs outline to fill a space left blank by ancient astronomers

                  taller than the elephant, but not so thick” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Aspin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 111).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> attempts no descriptive epithet, but his choice of the constellation may have been
                  influenced by the spectacle of the first living specimen of giraffe in <span class="placeName">Britain</span>, which was brought shortly prior to the period when he began composing the poem.
                  In <span class="date">summer 1827</span>, two young giraffes were sent to <span class="geogName">Europe</span>, one to <span class="persName">King George IV</span> of <span class="placeName">Great Britain</span> and the other to <span class="persName">King Charles X</span> of <span class="placeName">France</span>, as diplomatic gifts from <span class="persName">Mehmed (Muhammad) Ali</span>, the Pasha of <span class="placeName">Egypt</span>. (In <span class="date">1828</span>, a third giraffe arrived in <span class="placeName">Vienna</span>, as a gift to <span class="persName">Emperor Francis I</span> of <span class="placeName">Austria</span>.) While the British specimen was kept out of view from the public, in the <span class="placeName">Royal Menagerie</span> at <span class="placeName">Windsor Great Park</span>, an engraving of the animal “taken from life” with its attendants in Arabian costume
                  was published in the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Literary Gazette</span></span> with an account of the specimenʼs “differences from those” physical attributes “described
                  by preceding naturalists” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ITOLONDONZOO"><span class="persName">Ito</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">London Zoo and the Victorians</span></span></a>, 61; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#CAMELOPARDALISLITGAZETTE1827"><span class="titlem">“The Camelopardalis, or Giraffe”</span></a>, 554, 553). <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs awareness of the sensation cannot be proved directly; however, he notably does
                  not use the Latinate spelling, <span style="font-style:italic">camelopardalis</span>, which was normally applied to the constellation (e.g., by <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="persName">Aspin</span>, and <span class="persName">Green</span>), but rather the English derivation, <span style="font-style:italic">camelopard</span>, which was used for the animal (e.g., by the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Literary Gazette</span></span>). (In <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> and <span class="titlem">MS III</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> spells the constellation as <span style="font-style:italic">cameleopard</span>, but in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, he omits the first <span style="font-style:italic">e</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">camleopard</span>; see “camelopard, n.1”, <span style="font-style:italic">OED Online</span>, accessed <span class="date">15 May 2023</span>; see also <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 26; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 21).</p> 
               <p>The British kingʼs giraffe died in <span class="date">1829</span>, a cause of considerable chagrin since the French‐acquired specimen continued to
                  thrive for eighteen years in the <span class="placeName">Ménagerie du Jardin des plantes</span> in <span class="placeName">Paris</span>. Therefore, importation of four giraffes to the <span class="placeName">London Zoo</span> in <span class="date">1836</span>, outnumbering the one exhibited in the French exhibition, caused an outpouring of
                  pride and curiosity. The reaction is explained by <span class="persName">Takashi Ito</span> in context of perceived anxiety over the lagging progress of British science and
                  scientific institutions, among other factors (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ITOLONDONZOO"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">London Zoo and the Victorians</span></span></a>, 63–71).</p>

               <p>As <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> explains, two constellations named <span style="font-style:italic">Musca</span> existed for a time, one in the southern hemisphere and one in the northern hemisphere.
                  The earlier claim belonged to the southern constellation, situated immediately south
                  of <a class="link_ref" href="#CRUXGLOSS" title="the blessed cross (RF T70 MS III)Unless Ruskin mistook as a separate constellation what is often called the Cross or Northern C..."><span class="name">Crux (the Southern Cross)</span></a> and included among the twelve constellations that <span class="persName">Plancius</span> devised in <span class="date">1598</span>, based on observations by his fellow Dutchmen, <span class="persName">Keyser</span> and <span class="persName">de Houtman</span> during their exploration of the Indies (see <a class="link_ref" href="#HIRUNDOGLOSS" title="sweet hirundo (MS IA RF T70 MS III)Possibly referring to Apus a southern constellation north of Chameleon west of Crux (Souther..."><span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Apus</span></span></a>). Soon thereafter, the northern constellation emerged in seventeenth-century atlases,
                  but its invention has been credited to multiple astronomers, each of whom had his
                  own idea of what kind of insect was figured by the four stars above Aries. As surveyed
                  separately by Ridpath and by Barentine, the various names for the constellation included
                  Vespa (the Wasp); Apis, also Apes (the Bee); Musca (the Fly);  the Dutch word for
                  <span style="font-style:italic">fly</span>, De Vlieghe;  and the Greek word for <span style="font-style:italic">fly</span>, Muia  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 126–27; Barentine, Lost Constellations, 239-41).</p> 
               <p>Naming the northern constellation <span style="font-style:italic">Musca</span>, as <span class="persName">Hevelius</span> did in <span class="date">1687</span>, especially invited confusion through efforts to distinguish the northern constellation
                  from the southern, which was sometimes called <span class="name">Musca Australis</span>. In the posthumously published <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Atlas Coelestis</span></span> (<span class="date">1729</span>) by the English astronomer, <span class="persName">John Flamsteed</span> (<span class="date">1646–1719</span>), the image of a fly was engraved in the place of the four stars above <span class="name">Aries</span> but left unnamed,  while the name <span style="font-style:italic">Musca</span> was applied to the image of an insect in <span class="persName">Flamsteed</span>ʼs planisphere of the southern hemisphere. Yet, confusingly, while omitting a name
                  from the image of the insect in the plate devoted to <span class="name">Aries</span>, the atlas does identify that image in a planisphere of the northern hemisphere,
                  where it is labeled <span style="font-style:italic">Muica</span>, apparently harkening back to the Grecian <span style="font-style:italic">Muia</span>, <span class="persName">Plancius</span>ʼs name for the southern constellation (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#FLAMSTEEDATLASCOELESTIS"><span class="persName">Flamsteed</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Atlas Coelestis</span></span></a>, n.p.; see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 127, and <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHATLASCOELESTIS"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem">“Flamsteedʼs Atlas Coelestis”</span></a>). In the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span></span> (<span class="date">1801</span>) by <span class="persName">Johannes Bode</span>, the northern constellation gets the name <span style="font-style:italic">Musca</span>, while the southern counterpart is called <span style="font-style:italic"><span class="name">Apis</span></span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BODEURANOGRAPHIA"><span class="persName">Bode</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span></span></a>, pl. 11, 20). In the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span> (1822), <span class="persName">Alexander Jamieson</span> revised the name of the northern constellation to <span class="name">Musca Borealis</span> in order to distinguish it from <span class="name">Musca Australis</span> in the south—the first atlas to make that distinction, according to <span class="persName">Ridpath</span>—yet this innovation only prompted others to drop <span style="font-style:italic">Australis</span> from the name of the southern constellation, according to Barentine (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 198–99; Barentine, Lost Constellations, 241-42).</p> 
               <p>The course of these confusions matters since clues may emerge that point to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs source of information about all the constellations. His poem identifies <span class="name">“the little fly”</span> at line 34 and <span class="name">“the armed bee”</span> at line 48. Presumably, therefore, his source distinguished between the northern
                  and the southern constellations, naming one <span class="name">Musca, or the Fly</span>, and the other <span class="name">Apis, or the Bee</span>. This combination suggests a source traceable to <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span></span> or a derivative,  placing <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs “little fly” in the north and his “armed bee” in the south. While these identifications
                  cannot be confirmed with certainty, given <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs caveat noted in the <span class="titlem">MS III</span> fair copy of the poem to the effect that “[t]hese constellations though they are
                  next in this poetry are not next in the sky”, nonetheless the <span class="name">Fly</span> is said to be “next to” <span class="name">Camelopardalis</span>, which is named in line 33, and the <span class="name">Fly</span> is followed by the lines on <span class="name">Serpens</span>/<span class="name">Ophiuchus</span> (line 35) and <span class="name">Aries</span> (line 36). <span class="name">Musca Borealis</span> was not directly “next to” <span class="name">Camelopardalis</span> or <span class="name">Ophiuchus</span> in any correct view of the constellations, yet the northern hemisphere is strongly
                  suggested by this sequence of names—especially the nearby mention of <span class="name">Aries</span>—thus clinching the identification of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs Fly with the northern <span class="name">Musca Borealis</span>.</p> 
               <p>From where exactly did <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> derive his names for these constellations? A British source that conformed with <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs identification of the northern <span class="name">Musca (the Fly)</span> and the southern <span class="name">Apis (the Bee)</span> could have been <span class="persName">Alexander Jamieson</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span> or the derivative <span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span>, the set of thirty‐two constellation cards based on <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs plates, along with the toyʼs accompanying textbook, <span class="persName">Aspin</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span>.  In <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs plate 13, <span class="titlem">“Aries, and Musca Borealis”</span>, the <span class="name">Fly</span> is illustrated prominently within the border of the <span class="name">Ram</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 35, pl. 13). Adapted for the young audience of <span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span>, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs plate was imitated as card 16, <span class="titlem">“Aries and Musca Borealis”</span>. (The boundaries of <span class="name">“Musca Borealis”</span> are idenified also on other cards in <span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span>: namely, card 5, <span class="titlem">“Gloria Frederici, Andromeda”</span>, and card 6, <span class="titlem">“Perseus and Caput Medusae”</span>. For images of the cards, see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHURANIASMIRROR"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem">“Uraniaʼs Mirror”</span></a>.)</p> 
               <p>If <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> and his imitators pinned down <span class="name">Musca</span> in the north, it is less clear how the southern  <span class="name">Musca Australis</span> might have figured in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs naming of the <span class="name">“armed bee”</span>. In <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs <span class="titlem">plate 28</span>, a planisphere, the constellation appears as a small figure without an identifying
                  caption, perhaps owing to lack of space. Its image is absent altogether from <span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span>, since the illustrated cards exclude representation of constellations that lie too
                  far south to be viewed by British stargazers. The same exclusions apply to <span class="persName">Aspin</span>ʼs accompanying text, except for tables of the northern and southern constellations,
                  in which the listings play it safe by supplying all the variant names: the northern
                  one is “<span class="name">Apis, <span style="font-style:italic">vel</span> Musca Borealis—The Northern Bee, <span style="font-style:italic">or</span> Fly</span>”, situated north of <span class="name">Aries</span>, and the southern one is “<span class="name">Apis, <span style="font-style:italic">vel</span> Musca Australis—The Southern Bee, <span style="font-style:italic">or</span> Fly</span>”, situated south of <span class="name">Centaurus</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 105, 106, and see 131).</p> 
               <p>If <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> and his imitators neglected the illustration of the southern constellation, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> did give <span class="name">Apis</span> its due in the text, as the very last of his prose description of the constellations.
                  Identifying the asterism as <span class="name">“Musca Australis, the Southern Fly, or Bee”</span>, he bestows a royal coloring on the creature, which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> would have appreciated, given his favoring of constellations with monarchical associations—<a class="link_ref" href="#CHARLESSHEARTGLOSS" title="starry charlesʼs heart (RF T70 MS III)Cor Caroli (Charlesʼs Heart) northern constellation a small asterism consisting of only t..."><span class="name">Cor Caroli (Charlesʼs Heart)</span></a> in the north, and <a class="link_ref" href="#CHARLESSOAKGLOSS" title="great charlesʼs oak (RF T70 MS III)Robur Carolinum (Charlesʼs Oak) southern constellation east of Argo Navis (Argo the ship of ..."><span class="name">Robur Carolinum (Charlesʼs Oak)</span></a> in the south. <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, like <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, singles out the apian name for elaboration: “The introduction of the <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Bee</span></span> among the Celestial Host is a pretty idea, as well on account of the natural qualities
                  of this most extraordinary insect, as on account of its being the old hieroglyphic
                  of royalty. Of the insentient part of animated nature, the Bee is prince and chief
                  for foresight, ingenuity, industry, and fidelity: it was thence the fittest symbol
                  of a good king” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 63). If <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> was aware of any iconographic associations with the Bee at all, these royal attributes
                  may have been reinforced for him by the proximity of <span class="name">Apis or Musca Australis</span> to <span class="name">Charlesʼs Oak</span>, separated only by <span class="name">Crux</span> and <span class="name">Chameleon</span>.</p> 
               <p>As for Musca Borealis or the Northern Fly, one iconographic tradition connects it
                  with the "swarm of bees and honey" that collected "in the carcass of the lion" that
                  Samson killed with his bare hands when traveling to the Philistine woman he desired
                  for his wife (Judg. 14:8; see Barentine, Lost Constellations, 245). According to annotations
                  by Tbomas Scott, Samson in this episode was a type of "Jesus Christ, ere he entered
                  upon his public ministry, and on the cross before his ascension, overcame 'the devil,
                  that roaring lion, which walketh about seeking whom he may devour'". In the riddle
                  that Samson draws from this phenomenon to challenge the Philistines, "Out of the eater
                  came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness" (Judg. 14:14), Scott
                  reads: "The victory, which Christ obtained over Satan, by means of his agonies and
                  death . . . ; the glory that redounded to the Father; and the spiritual advantages
                  thence accruing to his people", which Scott goes on to elaborate at length (Holy Bible,
                  ed. Scott, 1:732, 733).</p> 
               <p>In another iconographic tradition, the Northern Fly was connected with Beelzebub,
                  Lord of the flies (e.g., Matt. 12:24, Luke 11:15; see Barentine, Lost Constellations,
                  245-48). When Jesus performed the miracle of causing the blind to see, and the dumb
                  to speak, the Pharisees attributed his power of "cast[ing] out devils" to the aid
                  of "Beelzebub, the prince of devils" (Matt. 12:24, the name <span style="font-style:italic">Beelzebub</span> signifying <span style="font-style:italic">Lord of a fly</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">Lord of a dunghill</span>. Jesus refutes the claim by arguing: "If Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against
                  himself: how shall then his kingdom stand" (Matt. 12:26). Scott interprets the parable
                  as referring to the self-thwarting of evil he similarly finds in Samson's riddle:
                  "if Satan aided Jesus in casting out devils, the infernal kingdom was divided against
                  itself; and how then could it any longer subsist?" (Holy Bible, ed. Scott, 5:92-93).</p> 
               <p>This evidence does not necessarily argue for <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs direct influence, however. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> could have derived both of his constellation names from a primer such as <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">An Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children</span></span> (<span class="date">1817</span>)</a> by <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>, which lists <span class="name">Musca, the Bee, or Fly</span> among “The New Constellations to the North of the Ecliptic”, while including <span class="name">Apis, the Bee</span> among “The New Constellations to the South of the Ecliptic”. Published prior to <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span>, <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs elementary work does appear, however, to have derived information from <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span></span> or a derivative (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Sherwood</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Introduction to Astronomy</span></span></a>, 15, 16).</p>

               <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> explains his playful poetic line, “The <span class="name">serpent</span>, <span class="name">serpent bearer</span> then”, with a footnote: “Note The serpent and serpent bearer are two different constellations”
                  (first added to the fair copy, <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, and repeated in the second fair copy, <span class="titlem">MS III</span>).</p> 
               <p><span class="name">Serpens (Serpent)</span> and <span class="name">Ophiuchus (Serpent Bearer)</span> are recognized as distinct constellations but treated as one by <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, Aspin, and <span class="persName">Green</span>. <span class="persName">Green</span> explains: “This constellation is represented by a man grasping a serpent. . . . It
                  is divided into two parts, one of which is assigned to <span class="name">Ophiuchus</span> and the other to <span class="name">Serpens</span>. . . . According to ancient tradition, . . . [the human] figure represents the celebrated
                  physician <span class="persName">Aesculapius</span>, son of <span class="persName">Apollo</span>, who was instructed in the healing art by <span class="persName">Chiron the Centaur</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 53–54). Put another way by <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, the intertwining of <span class="name">Serpent</span> and <span class="name">Serpent Bearer</span> forms “the symbol of medicine, and of the gods who presided over this art”, although
                  he adds naturalistically that “the reptile may also be the symbol of prudence and
                  vigilance” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 29).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Ridpath</span> relates a story explaining the connection between snakes and healing: “On one occasion
                  in <span class="placeName">Crete</span>, <span class="persName">Glaucus</span>, the young son of <span class="persName">King Minos</span>, fell into jar of honey while playing and drowned. As <span class="persName">Asclepius [Aesculapius]</span> contemplated the body of <span class="persName">Glaucus</span>, a snake slithered towards it. He killed the snake with his staff; then another snake
                  came along with a herb in its mouth and placed it on the body of the dead snake, which
                  magically returned to life. <span class="persName">Asclepius</span> took the same herb and laid it on the body of <span class="persName">Glaucus</span>, who too was magically resurrected” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 130).</p>

               <p>As traditionally understood, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> explains, “the <span class="name">Sun</span> enters <span class="name">Aries</span> on the 20th of March being the vernal equinox, the first day of Spring [in the northern
                  hemisphere], and the commencement of the astronomical year. It is then the beginning
                  of day at the <span class="geogName">North Pole</span>, the end of day at the <span class="geogName">South Pole</span>, and at this period the days and nights are equal, all over the globe except at the

The <span class="geogName">North Pole</span> is just coming into the light, and the <span class="name">Sun</span> is vertical to the Equator, which, together with the tropic of <span class="name">Cancer</span>, the parallel of <span class="placeName">London</span>, and the arctic circle, are all equally cut by the circle bounding light and darkness;
                  and hence the equality which reigns in all places in respect to the length of day

               <p>As <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> goes on to explain, however, while “[t]hese are astronomical truths”, “in nature
                  the sign <span class="name">Aries</span> has no part therein” since the precession of the equinoxes has caused the “place”
                  of <span class="name">Aries</span> to be “occupied by <span class="name">Pisces</span>” on the vernal equinox. “More than 2000 years have passed away since the sign Aries,
                  owing to the precession of the equinoxes, has ceased to open the astronomical year”
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 35). Traditionally, <span class="name">Aries</span> is considered the first sign of the <span class="name">Zodiac</span> because, as <span class="persName">Green</span> explains, it was “the first of the old <span class="name">zodiacal</span> constellations. About four thousand years ago, the vernal equinoctial point entered
                  this sign; but from its apparent motion towards the west, owing to the precession
                  of the equinoxes, it [the vernal equinox] is now found in the sign <span class="name">Pisces</span>, within which it has remained about 2000 years” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 63). In <span class="date">1822</span>, according to <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, the <span class="name">sun</span> then entered <span class="name">Pisces</span> on about <span class="date">6 March</span> and <span class="name">Aries</span> on about <span class="date">22 April</span>. Thus, the vernal equinox, which falls on 20–21 March, occurs when the ecliptic appears
                  oriented toward <span class="name">Pisces</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 50, 35).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Green</span> relates the legend associated with the Ram, “which bore the golden fleece. <span class="persName">Nephele</span>, queen of <span class="placeName">Thebes</span>, mother to <span class="persName">Phryxus</span> and <span class="persName">Helle</span>, being apprized of some murderous designs against her children, gave them this ram,
                  on whose back they were to be carried through the air to their friend <span class="persName">Aetes</span>, king of <span class="placeName">Colchis</span>. The rapid motion of the ram during their flight, and their elevation above the <span class="name">earth</span>, made <span class="persName">Helle</span> giddy, and she dropped from the back of the ram into that part of the sea which was
                  afterwards called the <span class="geogName">Hellespont [the Dardanelles]</span>. <span class="persName">Phryxus</span> arrived safe at his destination. Some time after, <span class="persName">Phryxus</span> was murdered at <span class="placeName">Colchis</span> by those who envied him the possession of the golden fleece, and it was this murder
                  which gave rise to the Argonautic expedition for the recovery of the fleece. . . .

               <p>The figure of <span class="name">the Charioteer</span> grasps reins with one hand, although his chariot is not outlined by stars; and with
                  the other hand, he cradles a she‐goat and kids. These incongruous attributes, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> explains, are associated with differing legends.</p> 
               <p>Two legends account for <span class="name">Auriga</span> as a charioteer. In one, he is <span class="persName">Erichthonius</span>, king of <span class="placeName">Athens</span>, who is credited with inventing the chariot. <span class="persName">Green</span> quotes from <span class="persName">Virgil</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Georgics</span></span>: “Primus <span class="persName">Erichthonius</span> currus et quatuor ausus / Jungere equos, rapidisque rotis insistere victor”. As translated
                  by <span class="persName">Dryden</span> in the edition <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> owned: “Bold <span class="persName">Ericthonius</span> was the first who joinʼd / Four horses for the rapid race designʼd” (bk. 3, lines

In gratitude to the goddess, <span class="persName">Erichthonius</span> instituted games known as the Panathenaea (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 50). Perhaps by association with the latter aspect of the legend, “[s]ome suppose
                  <span class="name">Auriga</span> to be the same with <span class="persName">Phaëton</span>, the son of <span class="persName">Sol</span>, who, undertaking to drive the chariot of the sun, set the world on fire, and was
                  struck by <span class="persName">Jupiter</span> into the <span class="geogName">Eridanus</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Aspin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 116–17).</p> 
               <p>In other accounts, <span class="name">Boötes</span>, in his role of driving the wagon in <span class="name">Ursa Major</span>, is credited with the invention of chariots, whereas <span class="name">Auriga</span> is associated with the story of another chariot racer, <span class="persName">Myrtilus</span>. “Mirtilius, a son of Mercury and Phaetusa, . . . was charioteer to <span class="persName">Oenomaus</span>, king of <span class="placeName">Pisa</span>, in Elis, and so skilled in riding and the management of horses, that he rendered
                  the steeds of his lord the swiftest in <span class="placeName">Greece</span>; but his infidelity to his master proved at last fatal to him” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 21). As <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> goes on to explain, thanks to <span class="persName">Myrtilus</span>ʼs horse training, his king was able to fend off suitors to his beautiful daughter,
                  <span class="persName">Hippodamia</span>, by challenging them to a race in which the penalty was death. After a dozen challengers
                  had met their death, another suitor won <span class="persName">Hippodamia</span>ʼs love, leading her to persuade <span class="persName">Myrtilus</span> to tamper with the kingʼs chariot. <span class="persName">Myrtilus</span> agreed since he was in love with the girl himself, and so the king was killed in
                  the race instead of the suitor. For his pains, <span class="persName">Myrtilus</span> was murdered by the jealous suitor. This fate explains his sad lack of a chariot
                  in the sky (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 50–51, and see 51 for a third legend mentioned by neither <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="persName">Green</span>, nor <span class="persName">Aspin</span>).</p>

               <p><span class="persName">Antinoüs</span>—a historical figure, not a mythical character—“was a great favourite of the <span class="persName">emperor Adrian [i.e., Hadrian]</span>, who erected a temple to his memory, and placed him among the constellations” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 30). In less euphemistic terms, <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span> was <span class="persName">Hadrian</span>ʼs lover, whom the emperor deified following the youthʼs death (whether by accident,
                  murder, or ritual suicide) while sailing on the <span class="geogName">Nile</span>, founded a city in his name, and spread his cult worship. Among <span class="persName">Hadrian</span>ʼs many tributes, the re-naming of an asterism below <span class="name">Aquila (the Eagle)</span> after <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span> may have been initiated by the emperor himself. Formerly, that asterism had been
                  figured by Greek astronomers as Ganymede, the beautiful boy abducted by Zeus to serve
                  as his cupbearer. <span class="persName">Ptolemy</span>, though living when the cult of Antinoüs was still vital, respected the Greek tradition
                  of Ganymede and Aquila while compiling the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Almagest</span></span>, but he mentioned the name of <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span>, as a sub‐division of <span class="name">Aquila</span>'s stars; he did not count <span class="name">Antinoüs</span> as a constellation separately or combined with Aquila among the forty‐eight in the
                  <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Almagest</span></span> (Barentine, Lost Constellations, 50-51).</p> 
               <p>Subsequently, as a constellation in itself, or even as part of the representation
                  of the constellation <span class="name">Aquila</span>, <span class="name">Antinoüs</span> remained unknown to the astronomical lore of the Middle Ages. The name first appeared
                  on star maps in the <span class="date">sixteenth century</span>, the earliest known representation of <span class="name">Antinoüs</span> originating with <span class="persName">Caspar Vopel</span> (<span class="date">1511–61</span>), a cartographer who worked in <span class="placeName">Cologne</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEKKERVOPEL"><span class="persName">Dekker</span>, <span class="titlem">“Caspar Vopelʼs Ventures”</span></a>, 174; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 187; By <span class="date">1822</span>, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> could still characterize the “asterism <span class="name">Antinöus</span> [sic] . . . [as] generally considered an integral part of the constellation <span class="name">Aquila</span>”, <span class="name">Aquila</span> et <span class="name">Antinöus</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 30).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Vopel</span> pictured <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span> in his sacrificial act, diving (or falling?) into the <span class="geogName">Nile</span>, a representation that influenced several subsequent <span class="date">sixteenth‐century</span> images, while in some he was shown as a reclining nude on a couch (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEKKERVOPEL"><span class="persName">Dekker</span>, <span class="titlem">“Caspar Vopelʼs Ventures”</span></a>, 174, 176). Soon thereafter, <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span> appeared as an independent constellation in a star list by Tycho Brahe (Barentine,
                  Lost Constellations, 51-52). He was reunited with the Eagle to form a single, dynamic
                  image in the <span class="date">1603</span> <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranometria</span></span> by <span class="persName">Johannes Bayer</span>; however, <span class="persName">Bayer</span> confused or identified <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span> with <span class="persName">Ganymede</span>, depicting the youth as borne aloft, naked and surpised, and gripped by his head
                  in the eagleʼs talon, presumably being carried off to be made <span class="persName">Zeus</span>ʼs cupbearer. Unlike <span class="persName">Bayer</span>ʼs other figures, <span class="persName">Ganymede</span>/<span class="persName">Antinuoüs</span> is not depicted from the back, but straining his right arm and hand into the uncertain
                  space to the left of the onlooker, as if groping for his destination yet fending off
                  his fate with his raised palm (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BAYERURANOMETRIA"><span class="persName">Bayer</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranometria</span></span></a>, pl. 16; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASHWORTHOUTOFTHISWORLD"><span class="persName">Ashworth</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Out of This World</span></span></a>, 9a).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Bayer</span>ʼs pose for <span class="persName">Antinuoüs</span> is taken over by <span class="persName">Johann Bode</span> in his <span class="date">1801</span> <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span></span>, but <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs figure loses the tension of struggle, leaving him the appearance of kneeling in
                  mid‐air, his arm raised in salute. While the bend of the arm is governed by an exacting
                  arc of stars, <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs figure seems comparatively passive, the features and body serene, as the Eagle
                  merely pushes him along with his claw, without gripping (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BODEURANOGRAPHIA"><span class="persName">Bode</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span></span></a>, pl. 9). <span class="persName">Johannes Hevelius</span>, in his <span class="date">1687</span> star atlas, likewise united the bird and human as a joint image. Rotating <span class="persName">Bayer</span>ʼs figures, <span class="persName">Hevelius</span> drives them from left to right, imagining them both as creatures of prey. This <span class="persName">Ganymede</span>/<span class="persName">Antinoüs</span> is not passively carried by the Eagle, but soaring with and even in front of the
                  bird. He is now a cherubic archer, keenly drawing his arrow in the same direction
                  as their flight. Elements of these two depictions—the passive, victimized <span class="persName">Ganymede</span>, and the aggressive <span class="persName">Cupid</span>‐like <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span>—combine in <span class="date">early nineteenth‐century</span> British representations of <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span> and <span class="persName">Aquila</span>.</p> 
               <p>In the <span class="date">1820s</span>, of course all the <span class="persName">Antinoüses</span> were decently clothed, a concern with decorum that possibly underlies <span class="persName">Green</span>ʼs indignation over “some writers assert[ing] that the figure which accompanies the
                  <span class="name">Eagle</span> is not <span class="persName">Antinous</span>, but <span class="persName">Ganymede</span>; thus referring the whole to one of the exploits of <span class="persName">Jupiter</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 57). <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> was not so prudish about identifying the Eagle “as that whose form <span class="persName">Jupiter</span> assumed when he carried to <span class="geogName">mount Ida</span> the beautiful <span class="persName">Ganymede</span>”, (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 30).</p> 
               <p>Decorum aside, as the inheritance of the iconographic traditions became more eclectic,
                  the treatment of the constellation became more disjointed. <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span> is a descendent in the line of <span class="persName">Bayer</span>ʼs and <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs figures, most clearly based on the latter: features impassive; torso erect; both
                  lower legs bent under at the knees, as if kneeling. If both the earlier sets of figures
                  moved as a unit, however, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs pair are pulling apart. The bird is turned 180 degrees, belly up, his wing now
                  adjacent to—not covering—the youthʼs left arm, and the birdʼs talons are fully retracted.
                  While disjoining the figures, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> rumages for attributes, bestowing <span class="persName">Hevelius</span>ʼs archery gear on his <span class="persName">Antinuoüs</span>, finding the stars to trace a bow and arrows in the figureʼs outstetched arm and
                  hand. Yet this <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span> merely holds the weapons, rather than aiming and drawing an arrow in the direction
                  of flight as <span class="persName">Hevelius</span>ʼs figure hunts with the diving bird. The <span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span> illustration detaches the boy even further from the eagle by turning <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span>ʼs head to gaze at the viewer, no longer engaged in the direction of his journey.</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, for his part, repeatedly divides conjoined figures from one another. He separates
                  <span class="name">Antinoüs</span> from <span class="name">Aquila</span> and <a class="link_ref" href="#ANSERGLOSS" title="the stupid goose (RF T70 MS III)Of the paired constellation Vulpecula et Anser (Fox and Goose) Ruskin lists here only the victi..."><span class="name">Anser (the Goose)</span></a> from <a class="link_ref" href="#VULPECULAGLOSS" title="the cunning fox (RF T70 MS III)Vulpecula (the Fox) northern constellation.

               <p><span class="persName">Ridpath</span> attributes this story to the Latin writer, <span class="persName">Hyginus</span>.

Yet another story, <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> adds, was contributed by the Roman emperor, <span class="persName">Germanicus Caesar</span>, who, in a rewriting of <span class="persName">Aratus</span>ʼs constellations poem, gave the arrow to <span class="persName">Eros</span> to prick <span class="persName">Zeus</span> with passion for <span class="persName">Ganymede</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 153).</p>

It emerged as a distinct constellation, separate

               <p><span class="persName">Green</span> links the constellation to a story about another dolphin, “which saved the life of

                  the ancients agree in representing the <span class="name">Dolphin</span> as the friend and protector of man” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 58–59).

               <p>From the time of <span class="persName">Ptolemy</span>, the altar was imagined with its base oriented to the north and with flames rising
                  from its top, oriented to the southern pole, and those visual elements were carried
                  into modern representations (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 47). It seems not just the depiction of flames, however, that moved <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, to insert the epithet <span class="name">“gods fire”</span> into the line as originally drafted in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span>; rather, his phrase suggests that he was forestalling association with the pagan
                  rites involved in the myths originally connected with the <span class="name">Altar</span>. The phrase “godʼs fire” imposes a <span class="orgName">Christian</span> typology on the altar flames, referring, e.g., to <span class="titlem">Leviticus</span> 6:12–13: “And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it, it shall not be put
                  out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and he shall burn thereon
                  the fat of the peace‐offerings. The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar: it
                  shall never go out”. In a commentary on the passage in his popular annotated <span class="titlem">Bible</span>, <span class="persName">Thomas Scott</span> (<span class="date">1747–1821</span>) reads the Levitical rites as a type of the permanence of <span class="persName">God</span>ʼs justice and <span class="persName">Christ</span>ʼs redemption: just as “the fire on the altar was kindled from heaven”, <span class="persName">Scott</span> explains, “and it must not be suffered to go out” causing it to “be replaced by ordinary
                  fire”, so “this fire was an intended type of the eternal avenging justice of <span class="persName">God</span>, and the perpetual efficacy of <span class="persName">Christ</span>ʼs all‐sufficient atonement” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SCOTTBIBLE"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Holy Bible . . . with Explanatory Notes, Practical Observations, and Copious Marginal
                           References</span></span>, by <span class="persName">Thomas Scott</span></a>, 1:345–46).</p> 
               <p>As an example of how the <span class="titlem">Leviticus</span> verse was applied as a historical type from <span class="titlem">Old Testament</span> to <span class="titlem">New</span> in Evangelical discourse, a writer for the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evangelical Magazine</span></span> cites “the watchfulness of the [Levite] ministers of the sanctuary—to preserve the
                  sacred fire on the altar. As this was kindled from heaven, and it was unlawful to
                  offer strange fire; the Levites watched to preserve the sacred flame from extinction,
                  by supplying it with fuel night and day. In this way <span class="persName">God</span> taught his ancient people the duty of watchfulness and incessant prayer, by rites
                  and ceremonies, which accorded with the genius of that dispensation when the church
                  was under age. But now that it is come to its majority, our <span class="persName">Lord</span> instructs us in a more manly way, by addresses to our judgment, conscience, and hearts,
                  which should lead us to . . . Watchfulness and Prayer” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#MEDITATIONSEVANGELICALMAG1835-12"><span class="titlem">“Meditations on Mark XIII.33”</span></a>, 489).</p> 
               <p>Whether <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> and <span class="persName">Green</span> remained strategically silent about the stories surrounding <span class="name">Ara</span>, fearing to meddle with pagan rites, or they considered the small constellation too
                  minor and too far south for English observers to merit a lengthy description, for
                  ancient writers this altar in the sky ranked as “a special one”, according to <span class="persName">Ridpath</span>. As described by both the Greek writer, <span class="persName">Eratosthenes</span>, and the Roman writer, <span class="persName">Manilius</span>, this altar was “used by the gods themselves to swear a vow of allegiance before
                  their fight against the <span class="persName">Titans</span>”. According to legend, <span class="persName">Cronus</span>—the chief of the most ancient gods, the giant <span class="persName">Titans</span>—swallowed all his children in an attempt to thwart a prophesy that they would grow
                  up to overthrow him. To prevent this fate befalling the latest child, <span class="persName">Zeus</span>, <span class="persName">Cronus</span>ʼs wife, <span class="persName">Rhea</span>, sent the infant to <span class="placeName">Crete</span> to be hidden in a cave. Meanwhile, she deceived <span class="persName">Cronus</span> by giving him a rock to swallow in place of the infant god. When <span class="persName">Zeus</span> had grown to maturity, he returned from <span class="placeName">Crete</span> and forced his father to vomit his siblings—<span class="persName">Hestia</span>, <span class="persName">Demeter</span>, <span class="persName">Hera</span>, <span class="persName">Hades</span>, and <span class="persName">Poseidon</span>—who were now also fully grown. Together, the new generation of gods vowed on the
                  altar, <span class="name">Ara</span>, to battle against <span class="persName">Cronus</span> and the <span class="persName">Titans</span> until defeating and overtaking the rule by the ancient gods (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 46–47; and see <a class="link_ref" href="AQUILAGLOSS"><span class="name">Aquila [the Eagle]</span></a> and <a class="link_ref" href="AURIGAGLOSS"><span class="name">Auriga [the Charioteer]</span></a>).</p>

               <p><span class="persName">Lacaille</span> intended the constellation, which he first named <span class="name">Machine Pneumatique</span>, as a tribute to experimental physics; and as <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> notes, <span class="persName">Lacaille</span>ʼs initial representation was based on the early single‐cylinder type of air pump

                  its bearer invisible; <span class="persName">Minerva</span>, the goddess of wisdom, furnished him with her buckler, which was resplendent as
                  glass; and he received from <span class="persName">Mercury</span> wings and a dagger, or sword”. Equipped with these armaments, which are represented
                  in <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs drawing of the hero, <span class="persName">Perseus</span> “cut off the head of <span class="persName">Medusa</span>, and from the blood which dropped from it in its passage through the air” as he flew
                  on <span class="persName">Mercury</span>ʼs wings, there “sprang an innumerable quantity of serpents, which ever after infested
                  the sandy deserts of <span class="placeName">Libya</span>”.</p> 
               <p>Returning to <span class="persName">Cepheus</span>ʼs kingdom, <span class="persName">Perseus</span> “found <span class="persName">Andromeda</span> chained naked to a rock”, in sacrifice “to be devoured by a sea monster, in order
                  that her father <span class="persName">Cepheus</span> might still preserve his kingdom. <span class="persName">Perseus</span> turned the monster into a rock by shewing it the head of <span class="persName">Medusa</span>, and thus rescued <span class="persName">Andromeda</span>, whom he immediately took to wife, as the reward of her patriotism and filial piety”
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 19–20). <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs ringing endorsement of <span class="persName">Perseus</span>ʼs “patriotism and filial piety” meets with some dissonance in more a extended version
                  of his myth, in which he is prophesied to kill his grandfather and eventually does
                  so. He is the enemy of tyrants, however, and the constant protector of his mother
                  and stepfather (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 140–42).</p> 
               <p>Versions of the myth differ in classical sources, which are variously retold in the
                  star atlases. In the version told by <span class="persName">Hyginus</span> in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Fabulae</span></span>, <span class="persName">Andromeda</span> is already promised as a bride before <span class="persName">Perseus</span> rescues her. In <span class="persName">Green</span>ʼs telling of this version, “[a]fter being promised in marriage by her father [<span class="persName">Cepheus</span>] to her uncle, <span class="persName">Phineus</span>, [<span class="persName">Andromeda</span>] gave herself up to be devoured by a sea monster”. Following her rescue, “<span class="persName">Cepheus</span>, her father, then betrothed her to <span class="persName">Perseus</span>. This contemplated union was violently opposed by <span class="persName">Phineus</span>, who, after a furious battle with his rival, was converted into a stone by the wonder
                  working head of the <span class="persName">Gorgon</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 40). In <span class="persName">Ovid</span>ʼs version, which may have been a source for <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs telling, there is no betrothal previous to <span class="persName">Perseus</span>ʼs; rather, <span class="persName">Perseus</span>, so amazed by <span class="persName">Andromeda</span>ʼs beauty that he at first mistakes the chained figure for a marble statue, calls
                  on <span class="persName">Cepheus</span> and <span class="persName">Cassiopeia</span> to accept him as a son‐in‐law before he saves the maiden. Their consent readily granted,
                  <span class="persName">Perseus</span> accepts the modest and compliant <span class="persName">Andromeda</span> without asking a dower and returns home. <span class="persName">Ovid</span>ʼs version is not <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs source for battle with <span class="name">Cetus</span>, however. In <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Metamorphoses</span></span>, <span class="persName">Perseus</span> slays <span class="name">Cetus</span> with the sword bestowed by the gods rather than turning it to stone with <span class="persName">Medusa</span>ʼs head. Instead, <span class="persName">Perseus</span> lays the head aside on a bed of seaweed, which soaks up the venom and hardens, accounting
                  for the origin of coral.</p>

The Greeks feigned the emblem of this sign to be
                  also <span class="persName">Astraea</span>, the goddess ofjustice; and their poets further affirmed her to be <span class="persName">Erigone</span>, daughter of <span class="persName">Icarius</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 42). A correction is supplied by <span class="persName">Ridpath</span>: “She is usually identified as <span class="persName">Dike</span>, goddess of justice, who was the daughter of <span class="persName">Zeus</span> and <span class="persName">Themis</span>; but she is also known as <span class="persName">Astraeia</span>, daughter of <span class="persName">Astraeus</span> (father of the stars) and <span class="persName">Eos</span> (goddess of the dawn)” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 179).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Green</span> relays a story about <span class="name">Virgo</span> as a goddess of justice: “Some say that the Virgin here placed in the skies was,
                  while on <span class="name">earth</span>, <span class="persName">Justitia</span>, who lived in the golden age and taught mankind their duty; but who, when their crimes

Because of this abandonment of mankind, <span class="name">Virgo</span> is represented with wings. This change from the Golden Age to the Silver Age was
                  initiated by the overthrow of <span class="persName">Chronus</span> and the <span class="persName">Titans</span> by <span class="persName">Zeus</span> and his siblings, who introduced the seasons and consequently revolutions of scarcity
                  and conflict. <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> adds the alternative myth about the fall of the Golden Age associated with <span class="persName">Demeter</span> and the loss of her daughter, the virgin <span class="persName">Persephone</span>, to abduction by <span class="persName">Hades</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 180–81).</p> 
               <p>For <span class="persName">Green</span>, description of <span class="name">Virgo</span> touches off controversy over calculating the age of the world. Just as, in discussing
                  <a class="link_ref" href="#LEOGLOSS" title="the generous leo (MS IA RF T70 MS III)Leo (the Lion) constellation of the northern Zodiac the fifth in the order of the Zodiac ...">Leo</a>, he rails against “antiquaries” who date relics of <span class="name">Zodiac</span> signs based on the precession of the equinoxes, arriving at conclusions that conflict
                  with the numbering of generations listed in the <span class="titlem">Bible</span>, so <span class="name">Virgo</span>ʼs ancient connection with the autumn equinox prompts his indignation with the “modern
                  philosopher” whose “speculations” lead to impiety: “We have mentioned that the sign
                  <span class="name">Leo</span> commences the <span class="name">zodiac</span> of <span class="placeName">Dendera</span>; but another zodiac has been discovered in <span class="placeName">Egypt</span> at <span class="placeName">Estné</span>, carved on a portico among the ruins at that place, commencing with the sign <span class="name">Virgo</span>; and from this circumstance it has been argued, that it must be at least two thousand
                  years older than the one at <span class="placeName">Dendera</span>. Some late discoveries respecting Egyptian writing, made by <span class="persName">M. Champollion</span>, have rendered it more than probable, that this ancient relic of astrology at <span class="placeName">Estné</span> was erected during the reign of the emperor <span class="persName">Claudius</span>, and that it could have preceded the one at <span class="placeName">Dendera</span> at most but by the duration of his reign, which continued only fourteen years. .
                  . . We should have passed this subject without notice, if the spirit of modern inquiry
                  did not strangely connect the speculations of science, and even those of fancy, with
                  the truths of revealed religion. The modern philosopher rejects as fabulous the chronology
                  of the <span class="titlem">Bible</span>, established on the uninterrupted evidence of a series of generations, and, by a
                  wonderful inconsistency and credulity, places implicit faith in the uncertain interpretation
                  of Egyptian signs and hieroglyphics, the date and the meaning of which are unknown”
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 80). <span class="persName">Green</span>ʼs objections, by exposing the supposed unscientific procedures of his adversaries,
                  reflect the influence of <span class="persName">Thomas Chalmers</span>ʼs approach to the “evidences” of <span class="orgName">Christianity</span> in relation to science (see <a class="link_ref" href="#LEOGLOSS" title="the generous leo (MS IA RF T70 MS III)Leo (the Lion) constellation of the northern Zodiac the fifth in the order of the Zodiac ...">Leo</a>).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, for his part, appears to found no grounds for contradiction. If <span class="name">Virgo</span> once coincided with the vernal rather than autumnal equinox, “that <span class="name">zodiac</span> carries us back 90° on the Ecliptic, and its date must be fixed about 6450 years
                  ago. This deduction, according to the chronology of the Sacred Writings, carries us
                  back to the earliest ages of the human species on earth, and proves, at least, that
                  Astronomy was among the first studies of mankind. The most rational way of accounting
                  for this <span class="name">zodiac</span> seems to be, by assigning it to the family of <span class="persName">Noah</span>, or perhaps to the patriarch himself; in which case it may be considered as a monument
                  that perpetuates the actual state of the heavens immediately subsequent to the creation.
                  In short, if it be fact, as appears, that <span class="persName">Noah</span> himself travelled eastward after the deluge, and his whole life leads us to believe
                  he was versed in all the science of his time, he might also transmit to his posterity,
                  the zodiac of the antedeluvians, without the equator or ecliptic. But though <span class="geogName">Asia</span> might thus become the cradle of Astronomy, the stargazers of ancient <span class="placeName">Egypt</span> in process of time were, without doubt, instructed in the true system of the world;
                  and attributed the order which reigns in nature to the wisdom of a supreme and eternal
                  First Cause, though they publicly chimed in with die popular errors of the multitude”

If <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> had in mind Scriptural references to the unicorn, as in <span class="titlem">Psalm 92</span> (<span class="titlem">KJV</span>), or the Christian symbolism associating the creature with chastity, the color white
                  would seem more apt. See <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs commentary on <span class="titlem">Psalm 78</span> (Septuagint and Vulgate) in Rock Honeycomb (<span class="date">1877</span>). In that note, he also refers to the nursery rhyme, <span class="titlem">“The Lion and the Unicorn”</span>, interpreting the beastsʼ “fighting for the crown” as the heraldry of the <span class="placeName">United Kingdom</span>—the lion representing <span class="placeName">England</span>, and the Unicorn <span class="placeName">Scotland</span>, with the shield between them (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Works</span></span>, ed. <span class="persName">Cook</span> and <span class="persName">Wedderburn</span></a>, 31:303–4). If the young <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> was thinking of the arms, the golden color might have referred to gilding.</p>

            <div class="note" id="LIBRAGLOSS"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><p><span style="font-weight:bold">“<span class="name">the scales</span>” (<span class="titlem">MS IA</span>; <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>; <span class="titlem">MS III</span>)—</span><span class="name">Libra (the Balance)</span> is the seventh sign of the <span class="name">Zodiac</span>. By modern dating, the <span class="name">sun</span> enters <span class="name">Libra</span> on October 27, according to <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs reckoning in the <span class="date">1820s</span>; and as an inheritance of ancient reckoning, which associated <span class="name">Libra</span> with the autumnal equinox, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> adds, “we are accustomed to say that when the <span class="name">Sun</span> comes to <span class="name">Libra</span>, . . . the days and nights are then equal all over the earth”, appropriately to the
                  sign of the balance, “except at the poles; and that it is the beginning of day at
                  the South Pole, and the end of day at the North Pole” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 44).</p> 
               <p><span class="name">Libra</span> bore differing meaning and significance for the Greeks and for the Romans—a difference
                  reflected in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs first‐drafted and first fair‐copied lines versus his subsequently revised lines
                  on the constellation (see textual note). His initial idea, playing on a name for <span class="name">Libra</span> as “the scales” rather than “the balance”, relates to the Greek notion that the constellation
                  “perpetuate[d] the memory of <span class="persName">Mochus</span>, the inventor of weights and measures” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 44). In <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs figure, because the scales are aerial, they “nothing to weigh would bear”, and
                  “yet contain a thousand more” (stars, presumably), perhaps even “more than than the
                  milky way” contains.</p> 
               <p>In his revision, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> substitutes the Roman interpretation of the scales as a balance of justice, “in which
                  twas vainly said / The crimes and virtues of men were weighed”—“vainly”, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> presumably means, because pagan justice has been superceded by <span class="orgName">Christian</span> judgment. <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> explains why the representation of balanced justice made <span class="name">Libra</span> a “favoured constellation” for the Romans: “The <span class="name">Moon</span> was said to have been in <span class="name">Libra</span> when <span class="placeName">Rome</span> was founded”. Thus, according to the Roman writer <span class="persName">Manilius</span> in the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomica</span></span>, “What sign would better have the care of Italy . . . than that which controls all,
                  knows the weights of things, marks totals, and separates the unequal from the equal,
                  the sign in which the seasons are balanced and the hours of night and day match each
                  other?” For it is given to <span class="placeName">Italy</span> in turn to control all. <span class="placeName">Italy</span> “belongs to the Balance, her rightful sign: beneath it <span class="placeName">Rome</span> and her sovereignty of the world were founded. <span class="placeName">Rome</span>, which controls the issue of events, exalting and depressing nations placed in the
                  scales: beneath this sign was born the emperor, who has now effected a better foundation
                  of the city and governs a world which hangs on his command alone” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 116–17; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#MANILIUSASTRONOMICA"><span class="persName">Manilius</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomica</span></span></a>, 283, 285 [bk. 4, lines 769–77]).</p>

               <p>The <span class="name">twins</span> are most commonly identified as the sons of <span class="persName">Zeus (Jupiter)</span>, <span class="persName">Kastor (Castor)</span> and <span class="persName">Polydeukes (Pollux)</span>, by <span class="persName">Leda</span>, Queen of <span class="placeName">Sparta</span>. <span class="persName">Leda</span> bore two sets of twins—by <span class="persName">Zeus</span>, <span class="persName">Pollux</span> and <span class="persName">Helen (later Helen of <span class="placeName">Troy</span>)</span>, who were immortal; and by her husband, <span class="persName">King Tyndareus</span>, <span class="persName">Castor</span> and <span class="persName">Clytemnestra</span>, who were mortal (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 97). “According to the fable, after the death of <span class="persName">Castor</span>, his brother, who was immortal, entreated his father, either to restore him <span class="persName">[Castor]</span> to life, or else to deprive him <span class="persName">[Pollux]</span> of existence. This request was refused by <span class="persName">Jupiter</span>, but he permitted <span class="persName">Castor</span> to share equally in the life of his brother, or that they should live and die alternately
                  every day. This decree was gladly accepted by <span class="persName">Pollux</span>, and consequently as long as one was on the <span class="name">earth</span> the other was in the regions of the dead” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 72).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs attribute of the <span class="name">twins</span>ʼ “clothes of fire” perhaps refers their association with the phenomenon of St. Elmoʼs
                  fire. According to <span class="persName">Pliny the Elder</span>, the “Stars which are named <span class="name">Castor</span> and <span class="name">Pollux</span>” could be observed “both at sea and at land”: “I have seen, during the night‐watches
                  of the soldiers, a luminous appearance, like a star, attached to the javelins on the
                  ramparts. They also settle on the yard‐arms and other parts of ships while sailing,
                  producing a kind of vocal sound, like that of birds flitting about. When they occur
                  singly they are mischievous, so as even to sink the vessels, and if they strike on
                  the lower part of the keel, setting them on fire. When there are two of them they
                  are considered auspicious, and are thought to predict a prosperous voyage. . . . On
                  this account their efficacy is ascribed to <span class="name">Castor</span> and <span class="name">Pollux</span>, and they are invoked as gods” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#PLINYNATURALISHISTORIA"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Natural History</span></span>, trans. <span class="persName">Bostock</span> and <span class="persName">Riley</span>, bk. 2, chap. 37</a>; see also <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 99).</p>

               <p>Ruskinʼs line bestows a poetic epithet on the sky rather than on the constellation,
                  which in his description suggests nothing more than a barnyard goat. <span class="name">Capricornus</span>, however, is a strange composite creature of goat and fish, a phenomenon that involves
                  <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> in discussion of the signʼs ancient history and etymology more than its legends,
                  which he calls “lame”. As if to draw attention away from the stories, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> seems reluctant in his plate to exhibit the strangeness of the creature, highlighting
                  realistically the goat that forms the upper half of the body, while only outlining
                  the fishtail that forms its lower half—the latter space dominated by the drawing of
                  <span class="name">Capricornusʼs</span> near neighbor, <span class="name">Aquarius</span> (plate 21) (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 46–47). In contrast, the artist who copied <span class="persName">Jamiesonʼs</span> depictions for <span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span>—the <span class="persName">Reverend Richard Rouse Bloxam</span> (1765–1840), possibly along with his spouse, <span class="persName">Ann</span> (1766–1835) (<span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, “<span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span>”)—exploited the amphibious weirdness of the creature by devoting a single card to
                  <span class="name">Capricornus</span>, without <span class="name">Aquarius</span> (card 25) and by coloring its tail a scaly blue‐green ending in a pink and yellow
                  fin.</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> may have averted to the immaterial “arched sky”, shying away from the Greek legends
                  about <span class="name">Capricornus</span>, if he knew them, which are mostly lascivious. <span class="name">Capricornus</span> is said to be <span class="persName">Pan</span>, whose adventures both <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> and <span class="persName">Green</span> confine to the origin story of his metamorphosis: “On a certain occasion”, as <span class="persName">Green</span> tells the story, “<span class="persName">Pan</span>, with some other deities, were feasting near the banks of the <span class="geogName">Nile</span>, when suddenly the giant <span class="persName">Typhon</span> appeared among them. This occasioned so much terror that they all changed themselves
                  into different forms and fled in every direction. <span class="persName">Pan</span>, who was the guardian of hunters and shepherds, plunged into the river; that part
                  of his body which was under the water assumed the form of a fish, and the other part
                  that of a goat. <span class="persName">Jupiter</span>, in order to preserve the memory of this event, placed this fantastic animal among
                  the stars” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 88).</p> 
               <p>Omitted are the stories and attributes favored by painters, such as the tale told
                  by <span class="persName">Ovid</span> of the <span class="persName">Panʼs</span> pursuit of the nymph <span class="persName">Syrinx</span>, who when she reached a waterside was metamorphosed into reeds. <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> summarizes: “As he [<span class="persName">Pan</span>] clutched the reeds the wind blew through them, creating an enchanting sound. <span class="persName">Pan</span> selected reeds of different lengths and stuck them together with wax to form the
                  famous pipes of <span class="persName">Pan</span>, also called the <span class="persName">syrinx</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 66).
