                        who depicted it as a fox with a goose captured in its jaws. The haplessness of the bird may account for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s epithet of &#x201C;stupid&#x201D;,

                    (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>)&#x2014;</hi>This constellation (pronounced Boh-oh-tease) is closely linked in legend with
                    the Great Bear, Ursa Major, because of its position behind the bear’s tail. The
                    origin of the name Boötes (Greek: Βοώτης) is not certain, but it probably comes
                    from a Greek word meaning ‘noisy’ or ‘clamorous’, referring to the herdsman’s
                    shouts to his animals. An alternative explanation is that the name comes from
                    the ancient Greek meaning ‘ox-driver’, from the fact that Ursa Major was
                    sometimes visualized as a cart pulled by oxen.
                    The Greeks also knew this constellation as Ἀρκτοφύλαξ (Arctophylax),
                    variously translated as Bear Watcher, Bear Keeper, or Bear Guard. Aratus wrote
                    of ‘Arctophylax, whom men also know as Boötes’, and likened him to a man
                    driving the bear around the pole. Homer in the Odyssey called him only Boötes,
                    which suggests it is the older of the two alternative names. Later astronomers
                    have given Boötes two dogs, in the form of the neighbouring constellation
                    Canes Venatici, but they were not part of the original Greek visualization
                    or legend.
                    According to a story that goes back to Eratosthenes, the constellation
                    represents Arcas, son of the god Zeus and his paramour Callisto, daughter of
                    King Lycaon of Arcadia. One day Zeus came to dine with the king, an unusual
                    thing for a god to do. To test whether his guest really was the great Zeus, Lycaon
                    cut up Arcas and served him as part of a mixed grill (some say that this deed
                    was done not by Lycaon but by his sons). Zeus easily recognized the flesh of
                    his own son. In a burning rage, he tipped over the table, scattering the feast,
                    killed the sons of Lycaon with a thunderbolt, and turned Lycaon into a wolf.
                    Then Zeus collected the parts of Arcas, made them whole again and gave his
                    reconstituted son to Maia the Pleiad to raise.
                    Meanwhile, Callisto had been turned into a bear, some say by Zeus’s wife
                    Hera out of jealousy, or by Zeus himself to disguise his paramour from Hera’s
                    revenge, or even by Artemis to punish Callisto for losing her virginity. Whatever
                    the case, when Arcas had grown into a strapping teenager he came across this
                    bear while hunting in the woods. Callisto recognized her son, but though she
                    tried to greet him warmly she could only growl. Not surprisingly, Arcas failed
                    to interpret this expression of motherly love and began to chase the bear. With
                    Arcas in hot pursuit, Callisto fled into the temple of Zeus, a forbidden place
                    where trespassers were punished by death. Zeus snatched up Arcas and his
                    mother and placed them in the sky as the constellations of the bear-keeper
                    and the bear. A second legend identifies Boötes with Icarius (not to be confused with Icarus,
                    son of Daedalus). According to this gloomy tale, recounted at length by Hyginus
                    in Poetic Astronomy, the god Dionysus taught Icarius how to cultivate vines and
                    make wine. When he offered some of his new vintage to shepherds they became
                    so intoxicated that their friends thought Icarius had poisoned them, and in
                    revenge they killed him.
                    His dog Maera fled home howling and led Icarius’s daughter Erigone to
                    where his body lay beneath a tree. In despair, Erigone hanged herself from the
                    tree; even the dog died, either of grief or by drowning itself. Zeus put Icarius
                    into the sky as Boötes, his daughter Erigone became the constellation Virgo and
                    the dog became Canis Minor or, in some versions, Canis Major. Boötes contains the fourth-brightest star in the entire sky, Arcturus
                    (Ἀρκτοῦρος in Greek), mentioned by Homer, Hesiod, Aratus, and Ptolemy. The
                    name means ‘bear guard’. Aratus described it as lying beneath his belt, while
                    Germanicus Caesar said it ‘lies where his garment is fastened by a knot’. Ptolemy
                    placed it between the thighs, which is where mapmakers have traditionally
                    depicted it. To the eye, Arcturus has a noticeably orange colour. Astronomers
                    have found that it is a red giant star about 25 times larger than the Sun, lying
                    37 light years away. (Ridpath, 53-5) 
<!--In Green, Bootes and Mons Maenalus are combined together.-->
                    Bootes is to the south of the Great Bear, between Cor Ca-
roli and Corona Borealis. It contains a very brilliant star of the first magni-
tude, called Arcturus, which shines with a reddish light, and is supposed to be 
nearer to the earth than any other star in the northern hemisphere. Arcturus 
is in the knee, or in the skirt of the garment of Bootes. When examined in 
the sky, it seems to be a continuation of the tail of Ursa Major. A curved 
line, commencing with Delta, and passing through Epsilon and Eta in the tail 
of that constellation, will enable the observer to find it. Three stars near 
each other, two of the fourth and one of the third magnitude, are in one leg 
and will be seen a little south of Arcturus; the other leg is marked by four 
stars nearly in a line, two of them are of the third, and two of the fourth mag-
nitude. By drawing an imaginary line from Gamma in the four-sided figure 
of Ursa Major, through Eta in the end of the tail, we shall find Beta in the 
head, and Lambda in the arm of Bootes; and a line passing through Delta, Ep-
silon and Zeta in the tail, will give us three stars of the fourth magnitude 
in that hand of Bootes which holds the cord or leash of his dogs. Gamma, in 
the shoulder of this arm, may be known by a line drawn through Eta and Zeta 
of the Bear. Delta, in the other shoulder, may readily be found, as it forms 
with Gamma and the star Beta in the head, a triangle, of which Beta is the most 
northern angle. Epsilon and Rho, in the girdle or middle, will be found with-
out difficulty. On a line between Arcturus and Gemma in the Northern Crown, 
may be seen four small stars, not marked on our plate, in a quadrilateral 
figure. These are in the hand which holds a club, denoted by some small 
stars, nearly in a straight line passing upwards between the shoulder of Bootes 
and Corona Borealis.
                    Bootes is bounded by the Mural Quadrant, the Great Bear, the Hunting 
Dogs, the Hair of Berenice, Mount Menalus, the Serpent of Ophiuchus, the 
Northern Crown, and Hercules. 
                    According to some Grecian fables, Bootes is supposed to have 
been formed in memory of Areas, the son of Calisto. This, however, con-
founds this constellation with Ursa Minor, which is also said to be in honour 
of Areas. Others imagine that Bootes was placed among the stars by the an-
cients for his great inventive genius, particularly for his construction and ma-
nagement of chariots; but the merit of this has been attributed to Auriga. 
From these facts it will be seen, that the origin of this constellation is involved 
in obscurity, and that the Greeks cannot claim it as their invention. The splen-
did star Arcturus, in this group, is mentioned twice in the book of Job. Some 
of the Greeks called this constellation Lycaon. The Latins, among other names, 
called it Canis. Bootes is represented as a man in a walking attitude, grasp-
ing in his left hand a club, and having his right hand extended upwards, in 
which he holds the leash of the dogs, named Asterion and Chara.(Green, 50-51) </p></note>

It may be an alternate name for Apus, though Apus is not described in Green.-->One of the dozen new constellations introduced at the end of the 16th century
                    from observations of the southern sky by the Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon
                    Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. Apus represents a fabulous bird of paradise, as found in New Guinea,but it is a disappointing tribute to such an exotic
                    creature, its brightest stars being of only 4th magnitude.
                    The name Apus comes from the Greek apous, meaning ‘footless’, since the
                    birds were originally known to westerners only from dead specimens without
                    feet or wings; these appendages had been removed by the locals, who prized the
                    plumage for ornamental dress. The first examples were brought back to Europe
                    by the survivors of Ferdinand Magellan’s round-the-world voyage in 1522,
                    creating immense interest. For a while it was speculated that these gaudy birds
                    were the mythical phoenix.
                    The constellation Apus was first shown on the 1598 celestial globe of Petrus
                    Plancius as ‘Paradysvogel Apis Indica’. It seems likely that the word ‘apis’,
                    meaning bee, was a misprint for ‘avis’, meaning bird, particularly since in that
                    same year the Dutchman Jan van Linschoten had given the birds the Latin
                    name Avis paradiseus. Johann Bayer also called the constellation Apis Indica on his Uranometria atlas of 1603, where it is depicted without wings or feet, doubtless
                    modelled on a dead specimen. Others, such as Johannes Kepler in the Rudolphine
                    Tables of 1627, called it ‘Apus, Avis Indica’ (Apus, bird of India), correcting the
                    apparent misprint, but the alternative usages of Apis and Avis continued to
                    Bode’s day.
                    Part of the bird’s tail was docked by Lacaille in the 1750s to form his south
                    polar constellation Octans, an unfortunate truncation given that in real life the

feet of Bootes is Mons Menalus, a mountain in Arcadia, and which received its 
name from Menalus, a son of Lycaon. This mountain, according to mytholo-
gists, was sacred to Pan, and was frequented by shepherds.(Green, 51)
                    
A mountain of Arcadia in the central Peloponnese, introduced as a constellation
                    by Johannes Hevelius in his Firmamentum Sobiescianum star atlas of 1687, where
                    it was depicted with Boötes standing on it. It appeared on many later maps,
                    always as part of Boötes, and it never had an independent existence.
                    The mountain took its name from a character in Greek mythology. Maenalus
                    was said by some mythologists to have been the eldest son of Lycaon, king of
                    Arcadia; this would have made Maenalus brother of Callisto and hence uncle
                    of her son Arcas, whom the constellation Boötes represents. Others, though, say
                    he was actually the son of Arcas and hence the grandson of Callisto. Either
                    way, Maenalus gave his name to the mountain in Arcadia and to the city of
                    Maenalon which he founded. Its modern name is Mainalo.
                    Mons Maenalus was sacred to the god Pan who frequented it. Ovid in his
                    Metamorphoses said that Mons Maenalus bristled with the lairs of wild beasts and
                    was a favourite hunting ground of Diana and her entourage, including Callisto.
                    In saying this, Ovid evidently rejected the story that Maenalus was Callisto’s
                    grandson, as the mountain would not yet have got its name. (Ridpath, 198)</p></note>

                    (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>)&#x2014;</hi>Johannes Hevelius, the Polish astronomer who introduced this constellation in
                    1687, continued to measure star positions with the naked eye long after other
                    astronomers had adopted telescopic sights. The French astronomer Pierre
                    Gassendi wrote that Hevelius had the ‘eyes of a lynx’ and this constellation can
                    be seen as an attempt to demonstrate that. Indeed, Hevelius wrote in his
                    Prodromus Astronomiae that anyone who wanted to observe it would need the eyesight of a lynx (‘oculos habeat Lynceos’), although he undoubtedly exaggerated
                    the faintness of the 19 stars he catalogued in it, typically by a full magnitude.
                    Lynx fills a blank area of sky between Ursa Major and Auriga that is surprisingly large – greater in area than Gemini, for example – but apart from one third- magnitude star (Alpha Lyncis) it contains no stars brighter than fourth
                    magnitude. Several of its stars had been listed by Ptolemy in his Almagest as
                    lying among what he termed the ‘unformed’ stars outside Ursa Major. Earlier
                    in the 17th century the Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius had made these stars
                    part of his new constellation Jordanus, the river Jordan (page 195), but it was
                    Hevelius’s alternative creation that endured. On his star atlas Firmamentum
                    Sobiescianum Hevelius called the constellation Lynx, while in the accompanying
                    star catalogue it is listed as ‘Lynx, sive Tigris’ (Lynx or Tiger). However, the illustration he presented does not look much like either animal.
                    It is not known whether Hevelius had in mind the mythological character
                    Lynceus who enjoyed the keenest eyesight in the world – he was even credited
                    with the ability to see things underground. Lynceus and his twin brother Idas
                    sailed with the Argonauts. The pair came to grief when they fell out with those
                    other mythical twins, Castor and Polydeuces (see Gemini, page 99).
                    Alpha Lyncis, magnitude 3.1, is the brightest star in the constellation, and
                    the only one with a Greek letter; the letter was assigned by the English
                    astronomer Francis Baily in his British Association Catalogue of 1845. (Ridpath, 119-120)

                    Lynx is a very uninteresting constellation. None of the 
stars exceed the fourth magnitude, and their number is but five, one near the 
mouth, and four near and on the tail. These, however, may be found without 
much trouble, by referring to the neighbouring groups. A line drawn from 
Dubhe through Omicron in the nose of Ursa Major, and produced to once their 
distance apart, will terminate at the star in the head of the Lynx. The stars 
in the tail are found by drawing a line from Omicron between Iota and Kappa 
in the fore foot of Ursa Major. The last star in the tail of Lynx is at the same 
distance on one side of the Bear's foot as Omicron is on the other. There is 
one nebula in this group.
Lynx is bounded by Ursa Major, Camelopardalis, Auriga, Telescopium 
Herschelii, Gemini, Cancer, and Leo Minor.
History.--This is one of the modern constellations, and was composed 
by Hevelius out of the unformed stars left by the ancients. Why a Lynx 
should have been chosen to represent this cluster of stars, rather than any 
other animal, does not appear: perhaps it was that we might here have a 
group of wild beasts together. (Green, 32)</p></note>

                    (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>)&#x2014;</hi>‘There is a certain place where the scorpion with his tail and curving claws
                    sprawls across two signs of the zodiac’, wrote Ovid in his Metamorphoses. He was
                    referring to the ancient Greek version of Scorpius, which was much larger than
                    the constellation we know today. The Greek scorpion was divided into two
                    halves: one half, called Σκορπίος (Skorpios), contained its body and sting, while
                    the front half comprised the claws. The Greeks called this front half Χηλαί
                    (Chelae), which means ‘claws’. In the first century BC the Romans made the
                    claws into a separate constellation, Libra, the balance.
                    In mythology, this is the scorpion that stung Orion the hunter to death,
                    although accounts differ as to the exact circumstances. Eratosthenes offers two
                    versions. Under his description of Scorpius he says that Orion tried to ravish
                    Artemis, the hunting goddess, and that she sent the scorpion to sting him, an
                    account that is supported by Aratus. But in his entry on Orion, Eratosthenes
                    says that the Earth sent the scorpion to sting Orion after he had boasted that he could kill any wild beast. Hyginus also gives both stories. Aratus says that the
                    death of Orion happened on the island of Chios, but Eratosthenes and Hyginus
                    place it in Crete.
                    In either case, the moral is that Orion suffers retribution for his hubris. This
                    seems to be one of the oldest of Greek myths and its origin may lie in the sky
                    itself, since the two constellations are placed opposite each other so that Orion
                    sets as his conqueror the scorpion rises. But the constellation is much older than
                    the Greeks, for the Sumerians knew it as GIR-TAB, meaning the scorpion, over
                    5,000 years ago.
                    Scorpius clearly resembles the shape of a scorpion, particularly the curving
                    line of stars that form its tail with its sting raised to strike. Old star maps such
                    as the one above show the lower left leg and foot of Ophiuchus, to the north, awkwardly overlapping the scorpion’s body. Incidentally, Scorpius is the modern
                    astronomical name for the constellation; Scorpio is the old name, now used only
                    by astrologers.
                    Stars of Scorpius
                    The brightest star in Scorpius is brilliant Antares, a name that comes from the
                    Greek word Ἀντάρης meaning ‘like Mars’, on account of its strong reddishorange colour, similar to that of the planet Mars. The name is often translated
                    as ‘rival of Mars’, but the star name expert Paul Kunitzsch prefers the translation ‘like Mars’. Antares is a remarkable supergiant star, several hundred times
                    the diameter of our Sun, lying about 550 light years away.
                    Beta Scorpii is officially named Acrab, from the Arabic for ‘scorpion’; an
                    obsolete alternative was Graffias, Latin for ‘claws’. Delta Scorpii is called
                    Dschubba, a strange-sounding name that is a corruption of the Arabic word
                    meaning ‘forehead’, in reference to its position in the middle of the scorpion’s
                    head. At the end of the scorpion’s tail lies Lambda Scorpii, called Shaula from
                    the Arabic meaning ‘the sting’ which is what Ptolemy said that it marked.
                    Ptolemy in the Almagest listed three stars as lying outside the constellation
                    (i.e. they were so-called unformed stars). The first of these he described as ‘the
                    nebulous star to the rear of the sting’. This is most likely the large and bright
                    open cluster we know as M7, which as a result is sometimes called Ptolemy’s
                    Cluster. M7 is the most southerly of the objects catalogued by the French
                    astronomer Charles Messier, at declination –34.8°. (Ridpath, 156-8)

                    This sign contains a very beautiful star of the first magni-
tude, named Antares, or the Heart of the Scorpion. This star may be found 
either by drawing a line from Wega Lyrse, through Alpha in the head of Ophi-
uchus, or by considering Arcturus as the summit of an isosceles triangle, of 
which Lyra and Antares form the other angles. Between Antares and the 
quadrilateral figure made by the stars in Libra, we find Beta, Delta and Pi in 
the form of a curve. Beta is near the ecliptic, and identifies the head of Scor-
pio. Below Antares, the tail of Scorpio may be readily distinguished, by fol-
lowing a long line of stars of the third and fourth magnitudes, one extremity 
of which line is in the Milky Way, and the other is curved upwards towards 
Antares.
This fine group of stars is bounded by Ophiuchus, Libra, Lupus, Norma 
Regula, Ara, and Sagittarius.
This sign was anciently represented by various symbols, sometimes by a 
snake and sometimes by a crocodile, but most commonly by the Scorpion. 
On both the zodiacs of Dendera there are rude delineations of this animal; 
that on the portico differs considerably from that on the other zodiac now in 
the Louvre.
Scorpio is the eighth sign in the ecliptic, and is denoted by the following 
character, n,; no doubt intended for a sketch of the animal itself.
History.--The Greeks, as we have before hinted, were desirous of being 
considered the founders of astronomy, and they accordingly applied some story 
of their own to almost every constellation. They give us a singular account 
of the origin of this sign. Scorpio, they say, is the animal which killed Orion, 
and that upon doing this service it was instantly placed among the stars. 
Diana, they say, earnestly requested Jupiter to do the same honour to Orion, 
to which, after some hesitation, he at last consented; but, upon placing him in 
the heavens, he gave him such a situation, that when the Scorpion should rise 
he should become invisible: they therefore never appear in the sky at the 
same time. The Egyptians, or whoever first framed the zodiac, probably 
placed Scorpio in this part of the heavens, to denote that when the sun arrives 
here, fever and other maladies common to autumn would prevail, as they ima-
gined the sting of that animal was of such a nature as to occasion some of 
these complaints. Mars was the tutelary deity of the Scorpion, and to this 
circumstance is owing all that jargon of the astrologers, who say that there is 
a great analogy between the malignant influence of the planet Mars and this 
sign. To this also is owing the doctrine of the alchemists, that iron, which 
metal they call Mars, is under the dominion of Scorpio; so that the transmu-
tation of it into gold can only be effected when the sun is in this constellation.
In the Hebrew zodiac this sign is allotted to Dan, because it is written 
"Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path." (Green, 83-84)</p></note>

                    (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>)&#x2014;</hi>Eratosthenes and Hyginus both affirm that the lion was placed in the sky
                    because it is the king of beasts. Mythologically speaking, this is reputed to be
                    the lion of Nemea, slain by Heracles as the first of his 12 labours. Nemea is a
                    town some way south-west of Corinth. There the lion lived in a cave with two
                    mouths, emerging to carry off the local inhabitants, who were becoming scarce.
                    The lion was an invulnerable beast of uncertain parentage; it was variously said
                    to have been sired by the dog Orthrus, the monster Typhon, or even to be the
                    offspring of Selene, the Moon goddess. Its skin was proof against all weapons,
                    as Heracles found when he shot an arrow at the lion and saw that it simply
                    bounced off.
                    Undeterred, Heracles heaved up his mighty club and made after the animal,
                    which retreated into its cave. Heracles blocked up one of the entrances and went
                    in through the other. He grappled with the lion, locking his huge arm around
                    its throat and choking the beast to death. Heracles carried the lion’s corpse away
                    in triumph on his shoulders. Later he used the creature’s own razor-sharp claws
                    to cut off its pelt, which he wore as a cloak. The lion’s gaping mouth bobbing
                    above his own head made Heracles look more fearsome than ever.
                    The Greeks knew the constellation as Λέων, simply ‘lion’, and it is easy to
                    make out the shape of a crouching lion among its stars. The head and chest are
                    outlined by six stars arranged in the shape of a sickle. At the foot of the Sickle,
                    marking the lion’s heart (according to Ptolemy’s description), is the constellation’s brightest star, Alpha Leonis, which we call Regulus, Latin for ‘little king’.
                    Ptolemy in the Almagest called it Βασιλίσκος (Basiliskos, or Basiliscus in Latin transliteration) which means the same. The name Basiliskos first appeared in
                    print with the Greek writer Geminus roughly two centuries before Ptolemy; the
                    earlier writers Aratus and Eratosthenes gave the star no name at all. The Babylonians knew the star as LUGAL, ‘king’.
                    On the tip of the tail is the star Beta Leonis, called Denebola from the Arabic
                    for ‘the lion’s tail’. Gamma Leonis is called Algieba, from the Arabic meaning
                    ‘the forehead’; this seems puzzling, since according to Ptolemy it lies in the lion’s
                    neck, but the Arabs saw here a very much larger lion than the one visualized by
                    the Greeks. Gamma Leonis is a celebrated double star, consisting of a pair of
                    yellow giant stars divisible in small telescopes. Delta Leonis is called Zosma from
                    a Greek word meaning ‘girdle’ or ‘loin cloth’, mistakenly applied to this star in
                    Renaissance times; in fact it lies in the lion’s rump.
                    Ptolemy listed eight ‘unformed’ stars lying outside the body of Leo. Three
                    of them formed a triangle to the north of the lion’s tail, marking the corners of
                    what Ptolemy referred to as a ‘nebulous mass’. This was the large open cluster
                    we know as Melotte 111, now part of Coma Berenices which was made into a
                    separate constellation in the 16th century (page 78). (Ridpath, 112-3)

This constellation is directly south of the Great Bear, 
and embraces many considerable stars. Alpha, on the breast of the Lion, is a beau-
tiful star of the first magnitude. It is called Regulus, or Cor Leonis, the 
Lion's heart: it is on the ecliptic. A line drawn from Delta, through Gamma 
in Ursa Major, will not only point out Regulus, but will also pass the star 
Gamma in the neck of the Lion. Gamma, with Eta, Zeta, Mu and Epsilon, 
form a curve on the body and head. These five stars, with Regulus, present 
the appearance of a reaper's sickle, as we have figured them on our plate. 
Regulus and Eta are in the handle, and Gamma, Zeta, Mu and Epsilon in the 
blade of the instrument. Kappa and Lambda, the first in the nose and the 
other in the mouth, make a quadrilateral figure with Epsilon and Mu. By 
drawing a line from Regulus towards Arcturus, Deneb or Denebola, a star of 
the second magnitude in the tail of the Lion, will be seen. A line from Regu-
lus to the Hair of Berenice, will give Delta. Deneb and Delta form with Theta 
nearly a right-angled triangle. Iota, Tau, and Upsilon, in the hind leg, are 
nearly in a straight line with Delta and Theta. A line drawn from Deneb 
through Regulus, will show Zi and Omicron in the fore claws. A large four-
sided figure is formed by connecting Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta.
Leo is bounded by Leo Minor, Cancer, Hydra, Sextans, Virgo, Coma Be-
renices, and Ursa Major.
The figure of Leo, very much as we now have it, is in all the Indian and 
Egyptian zodiacs. The overflowing of the Nile, which was anxiously and re-
gularly expected every year by the Egyptians, took place when the sun was 
in this sign: they therefore paid more attention to it than to any other. We 
have little doubt that this was the principal reason why Leo stands first in the 
zodiacs of Dendera. The circular zodiac before alluded to, and which adorned 
the ceiling of one of the inner rooms of the ancient building in that city, has 
within a few years been removed to Paris, and it now appears, in apparently 
perfect preservation, in one of the apartments of the Louvre. This interesting 
relic of astrology, after being cut away from the ruins where it was found, is 
about one foot thick and eight feet square. The rock of which it is composed 
is sandstone. On the face of this stone, appears a large square enclosing a cir-
cle four feet in diameter, in which are arranged, in an irregular spiral line, the 
zodiacal constellations, commencing with the sign Leo. On each side of this 
spiral line a great variety of figures are placed: these are supposed to repre-
sent other constellations, though they bear no analogy in form to those we 
now have. Many of these figures are accompanied with hieroglyphics, which 
probably express their names. We have seen two or three drawings of this 
curious relic, and have been greatly astonished at the wonderful conclusions 
which have been drawn from it. Compared with our present planispheres, or 
with stellar phenomena, it abounds with contradictory and irrelevant matter. 
So far from proving, what has often been strenuously maintained, that the 
Greeks took from it the model of their zodiac, which they have transmitted to 
us--it seems to demonstrate directly the reverse.' The twelve signs, it is true, 
are there, but they are not in their proper places. Cancer is between Leo 
and the pole; Virgo bears no proportion to the rest; some of the signs are placed 
double; they are all out of the ecliptic, and by no means occupy those regular 
and equal portions of space which Egyptian astronomers are said to have ex- 
actly measured by means of their clepsydra. The figures, out of what may be 
called the zodiacal circle, could never have included the same stars in the hea-
vens which are now circumscribed by the figures of the constellations. For 
ourselves we believe, that the small apartment in the ruins of Dendera, which 
was mysteriously ceiled with this zodiac, was used for the purposes of judicial 
astrology, and that the sculptured figures upon it were employed in horoscopi-
cal predictions, and in that casting of nativities for which the Egyptians were 
so famous.
Leo is the fifth sign of the zodiac, and is marked with the following 
figure, a; which somewhat resembles the tail of a lion.
History.--The Greeks have fabled that this Lion represents the formidable 
animal which inhabited the Nemaean forests. After it was slain by Hercules, 
it became this constellation. Some writers have applied the story of the twelve 
labours of Hercules to the progress of the sun through the twelve signs; and 
as the combat of that hero with the Lion was his first labour, they have made 
Leo the first of their signs. The figure of the Lion was, however, on the 
Egyptian charts long before the invention of the fables of Hercules. In hiero-
glyphical writing the Lion was an emblem of violence and fury; and the re-
presentation of this animal in the zodiac, signified the intense heat occasioned 
by the sun when he entered that part of the ecliptic. The Egyptians were 
much annoyed by lions during the heat of summer, as they at that season left 
the desert and haunted the banks of the Nile, which had then reached its 
greatest elevation: it was therefore natural for their astronomers to place the 
Lion where we find him in the zodiac.
In the Hebrew zodiac the Lion of course refers to the tribe of Judah. (Green, 75-78)</p></note>

                <note xml:id="CAMELOPARDALISGLOSS" resp="#DCH">One of the most unlikely animals to be found in the sky is a giraffe. The Greeks
                    called giraffes ‘camel leopards’ because of their long necks and spots, which is
                    where the name Camelopardalis comes from. However, the constellation
                    Camelopardalis was not invented by the Greeks but by the Dutch theologianand astronomer Petrus Plancius in 1612. Plancius first showed it on a celestial
                    globe in that year along with another odd constellation that is still recognized,
                    Monoceros. Plancius used the same name for the constellation as we do, but on
                    some old maps the name is also written as Camelopardalus or Camelopardus.
                    Camelopardalis lies in the far northern sky between the head of the Great Bear
                    and Cassiopeia, an area that was left blank by the Greeks because it contains
                    no stars brighter than fourth magnitude.
                    The exact significance of the constellation is unclear. The German astron -
                    omer Jacob Bartsch (c.1600–33) included Camelopardalis on his map of 1624,
                    which was its first appearance in print as distinct from its depiction on a globe.
                    Bartsch interpreted it as the camel on which Rebecca rode into Canaan for her
                    marriage to Isaac, as told in Chapter 24 of the book of Genesis. But
                    Camelopardalis is a giraffe not a camel, so Bartsch’s explanation is unsatisfactory. Bartsch seems not to have known much about this constellation, for he
                    wrongly attributed its invention to Isaac Habrecht of Strasbourg, who had
                    shown it on his star globe of 1621.
                    Its three brightest stars were labelled Alpha, Beta, and Gamma by the
                    English astronomer Francis Baily in his British Association Catalogue of 1845. By
                    modern measurements Beta is magnitude 4.0 and Alpha is 4.3, so this is one of
                    the constellations in which Alpha is not the brightest star (Ridpath, 56-57)

This asterism was formed by Helvetius. It occupies a considerable space 
in the heavens, extending from Auriga to the North pole. It contains fifty-
eight small stars, the most conspicuous of which is on the Arctic circle. It is 
bounded by the Pole star, Ursa Major, Lynx, Perseus and Auriga. (Green, 26)

                <note xml:id="MUSCAGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Musca, or the Fly, is a small modern constellation containing only six 
stars, three of which are noticed on our plate; one is of the third magnitude, 
and two are of the fourth. Its position is a little to the south of the Triangle 
and Perseus. The principle stars in it form a small triangle, and are some-
times mistaken for Triangulum Minus. The star of the third magnitude in 
Musca, forms with Algol and Zeta in the southern foot of Perseus, a triangle 
nearly equilateral. (Green, 41)
                   
 A small constellation to the south of Crux, the southern cross. Musca was one
                    of the 12 southern constellations introduced at the end of the 16th century by
                    Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman from the stars they
                    observed during the first Dutch expeditions to the East Indies. It was first
                    depicted by their fellow Dutchman Petrus Plancius on his globe of 1598, but for some reason he left it unnamed. In de Houtman’s catalogue of 1603,
                    completed after Keyser’s death, it is called De Vlieghe, Dutch for fly.
                    Johann Bayer, also in 1603, showed the insect on his plate of the 12 new
                    southern constellations in Uranometria but called it Apis, the bee, an alternative
                    title which was widely used for two centuries. The Dutch historian Elly Dekker
                    believes that this alternative identification arose because Bayer copied his southern constellations from globes produced by Jodocus Hondius (1563–1612) in
                    1600 and 1601, on which the figure was left unnamed. Not knowing what it was
                    meant to depict, Bayer wrongly identified it as a bee (apis), not a fly (musca).
                    The first known use of the Latin name Musca for this constellation was in
                    1602 on a globe by Willem Janszoon Blaeu (1571–1638), another Dutch carto -
                    grapher and rival to Plancius. Plancius himself did not adopt a name for the
                    constellation until 1612, when he called it Muia, the Greek for fly, on a globe
                    produced that year. For a time it was known as Musca Australis, when there was
                    also a northern fly, Musca Borealis, in the sky (page 198).
                    The constellation’s brightest star, Alpha Muscae, is of third magnitude. None
                    of its stars is named, and there are no legends about the fly. (Ridpath, 126-7)</note>

                <note xml:id="SERPENSGLOSS" resp="#DCH">This constellation is unique, for it is divided into two parts – Serpens Caput, the
                    head, and Serpens Cauda, the tail. Nevertheless, astronomers regard it as a
                    single constellation. Serpens represents a huge snake held by the constellation
                    Ophiuchus. Its usual Greek name was Ὄφις (Ophis), but in the Almagest Ptolemy
                    gave it as Ὄφις Ὀφιούχου, i.e. the serpent of the serpent-holder, presumably
                    to prevent confusion with the other celestial serpents Draco and Hydra.
                    In his left hand Ophiuchus grasps the top half of the snake, while his right
                    hand holds the tail. Aratus and Manilius agreed that Serpens was coiled around
                    the body of Ophiuchus, but most star atlases show the snake simply passing
                    between his legs or behind his body (for an illustration of the full tableau, see
                    Ophiuchus, page 131).
                    In mythology Ophiuchus was identified as the healer Asclepius, a son of
                    Apollo, although why he appears to be wrestling with a serpent in the sky is not
                    fully explained. His connection with snakes is attributed to the story that he
                    once killed a snake which was miraculously restored to life by a herb placed on
                    it by another snake. Asclepius subsequently used the same technique to revive
                    dead people. Snakes are the symbol of rebirth because they shed their skins
                    every year.
                    Ptolemy in the Almagest listed the stars of Ophiuchus and Serpens as separate
                    constellations, but mythologists such as Eratosthenes and Hyginus dealt with
                    them as a unit. One of the few celestial map makers to show Serpens separately
                    was Johann Bayer, who devoted a page of his atlas to each of the Ptolemaic
                    constellations. Other major celestial chart makers such as Hevelius, Flamsteed,
                    and Bode followed the mythologists in treating Ophiuchus and the snake as a
                    composite figure, with the snake partly obscured by the body of Ophiuchus.
                    When Eugène Delporte came to define the official constellation boundaries
                    in the late 1920s he was faced with the problem of how to separate the intertwined figures of Ophiuchus and Serpens. His solution was to chop Serpens
                    into the two halves that we see today, the head on one side of Ophiuchus and
                    the tail on the other. The head is by far the larger half, covering an area over
                    twice that of the tail. From the western border to the east the official boundaries
                    of Serpens span nearly 57° of sky, just over half the length of Hydra, the water
                    snake, which is the largest constellation of all.
                    The constellation’s brightest star, third-magnitude Alpha Serpentis, is called
                    Unukalhai from the Arabic meaning ‘the serpent’s neck’, where it is located.
                    The tip of the serpent’s tail is marked by Theta Serpentis, called Alya, an Arabic word that actually refers to a sheep’s tail. The most celebrated object in Serpens
                    is a star cluster called M16, embedded in a gas cloud called the Eagle Nebula,
                    which takes its name from its supposed resemblance to a large bird of prey. The
                    Eagle Nebula was the subject of a famous photograph by the Hubble Space
                    Telescope showing pillars of gas and forming stars. (Ridpath, 161-2)
<!--In Green, Serpens is combined with Ophiuchus.--></note>

                <note xml:id="OPHIUCHUSGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Ophiuchus (pronounced off-ee-YOO-cuss) represents a man with a snake coiled
                    around his waist. He holds the head of the snake in his left hand and its tail in
                    his right hand. The snake is represented by a separate constellation, Serpens.
                    The Greek spelling of the name was Ὀφιοῦχος (Ophiouchos).
                    The Greeks identified him as Asclepius, the god of medicine (Aesculapius in
                    Latin). Asclepius was the son of Apollo and Coronis (although some say that his
                    mother was Arsinoë). The story goes that Coronis two-timed Apollo by sleeping
                    with a mortal, Ischys, while she was pregnant by Apollo. A crow brought Apollo
                    the unwelcome news, but instead of the expected reward the crow, which until
                    then had been snow-white, was cursed by Apollo and turned black.
                    In a rage of jealousy, Apollo shot Coronis with an arrow. Rather than see his
                    child perish with her, Apollo snatched the unborn baby from its mother’s womb
                    as the flames of the funeral pyre engulfed her, and took the infant to Chiron,
                    the wise centaur (represented in the sky by the constellation Centaurus). Chiron
                    raised Asclepius as his own son, teaching him the arts of healing and hunting.
                    Asclepius became so skilled in medicine that not only could he save lives, he
                    could also raise the dead.
                    Asclepius and the snake
                    On one occasion in Crete, Glaucus, the young son of King Minos, fell into jar
                    of honey while playing and drowned. As Asclepius contemplated the body of
                    Glaucus, a snake slithered towards it. He killed the snake with his staff; then
                    another snake came along with a herb in its mouth and placed it on the body
                    of the dead snake, which magically returned to life. Asclepius took the same
                    herb and laid it on the body of Glaucus, who too was magically resurrected.
                    (Robert Graves suggests that the herb was mistletoe, which the ancients thought
                    had great regenerative properties, but perhaps it was actually willow bark, the
                    source of salicylic acid, the active ingredient in aspirin.)
                    Because of this incident, says Hyginus, Ophiuchus is shown in the sky holding a snake, which became the symbol of healing from the fact that snakes shed
                    their skin every year and are thus seemingly reborn. Others, though, say that
                    Asclepius received from the goddess Athene the blood of Medusa the Gorgon.
                    The blood that flowed from the veins on her left side was a poison, but the blood
                    from the right side could raise the dead.
                    Someone else supposedly resurrected by Asclepius was Hippolytus, son of
                    Theseus, who died when he was thrown from his chariot; some identify him with the constellation Auriga, the charioteer. Reaching for his healing herbs,
                    Asclepius touched the youth’s chest three times, uttering healing words, and
                    Hippolytus raised his head.
                    Hades, god of the Underworld, began to realize that the flow of dead souls
                    into his domain would soon dry up if this technique became widely known. He
                    complained to his brother god Zeus who struck down Asclepius with a thunderbolt. Apollo was outraged at this harsh treatment of his son and retaliated by
                    killing the three Cyclopes who forged Zeus’ thunderbolts. To mollify Apollo,
                    Zeus made Asclepius immortal (in the circumstances he could hardly bring him
                    back to life again) and set him among the stars as the constellation Ophiuchus.
                    Stars of Ophiuchus
                    The head of Ophiuchus is marked by its brightest star, second-magnitude Alpha
                    Ophiuchi, called Rasalhague from the Arabic meaning ‘the head of the serpent
                    collector’. Beta Ophiuchi is called Cebalrai from the Arabic for ‘the shepherd’s
                    dog’; the Arabs visualized a shepherd (the star Alpha Ophiuchi) along with his
                    dog and some sheep in this area. Ptolemy in the Almagest located Beta and Gamma Ophiuchi in the serpent holder’s right shoulder; the left shoulder is
                    marked by Iota and Kappa Ophiuchi.
                    Delta and Epsilon Ophiuchi are called Yed Prior and Yed Posterior. These
                    are compound names, formed from the Arabic al-yad, meaning ‘hand’, with the
                    Latin words prior and posterior added to give names meaning the ‘leading’ and
                    ‘following’ parts of the hand. The hand in question is the left one; the right
                    hand, according to Ptolemy, was marked by the stars we know as Nu and Tau
                    Ophiuchi, but these have no proper names.
                    Zeta and Eta Ophiuchi are his left and right knees, while Rho and Theta
                    Ophiuchi are in his feet. Scorpius, the scorpion, lies beneath his feet. Aratus said
                    that Ophiuchus ‘tramples’ the scorpion with both feet, but in reality it is only
                    the left foot that stands on the scorpion; the right foot remains well clear of it.
                    Between the right shoulder of Ophiuchus and the tail of the serpent lies a
                    V-shaped group of five stars that Ptolemy regarded as being outside the main
                    figure of Ophiuchus. These stars were later incorporated into the short-lived
                    constellation Taurus Poniatovii (page 204). Barnard’s Star, the second-closest
                    star to the Sun at 5.9 light years away, lies in this same area, near 66 Ophiuchi.
                    Ophiuchus was the site of the last supernova seen in our Galaxy. This
                    appeared in 1604 near Xi Ophiuchi and reached an estimated maximum
                    magnitude of −3. It is known as Kepler’s Star after Johannes Kepler who
                    described it in a book called De stella nova (1606).
                    Ophiuchus and the zodiac
                    Although Ophiuchus is not one of the official 12 constellations of the zodiac,
                    the Sun passes through its southern regions in the first half of December. The
                    Sun’s path, the ecliptic, is the black-and-white line crossing the feet of Ophiuchus
                    in the chart on the previous page. According to the modern constellation boundaries, the Sun spends longer in Ophiuchus than it does in adjoining Scorpius.
                    Hence Ophiuchus is sometimes referred to as the 13th sign of the zodiac.(Ridpath, 130-2)

This constellation is represented by a man grasping a ser-
pent, for which reason it is called Serpentarius by the Latins, and Ophiuchus 
by the Greeks. It is divided into two parts, one of which is assigned to Ophiu-
chus and the other to Serpens. It occupies a large space in the heavens, be-
tween Hercules and the Milky Way, which includes a portion of it . The most 
brilliant star in the group is Alpha in the head of Ophiuchus: it is of the se-
cond magnitude, and is named Rhas Alhague: its contiguity to Ras Algothi, in 
the head of Hercules, will be a sufficient direction for finding it. These two 
stars form the base of a long isosceles triangle, of which Wega Lyne is the 
vertex. To the south of Alpha, on either side, may be seen the stars in the 
shoulders. Beta and Gamma, of the third magnitude, are in the right shoul-
der, and Iota and Kappa, of the fourth magnitude, are in the left. Iota and 
Gamma form with Alpha an isosceles triangle, of which Alpha is the summit.
Alpha and Beta make with Delta in the left hand a long scalene triangle. Ep-
silon will be seen near to Delta. Upsilon is in the right hand. The right and 
left knee may be known by Eta and Zeta, and the right and left foot and ankle 
by Theta and Phi.
The head of the Serpent is directly south of Corona Borealis, and may be 
easily known by some stars of the third and fourth magnitudes, which form with 
Beta and Gamma in the shoulder of Hercules, a figure resembling the letter Y. 
The tail of the Y inclines toward the south, and is terminated by Alpha Ser-
pentis, a bright star of the second magnitude, named the heart of the Serpent. 
Having found the head and the heart of the Serpent, by following with the eye 
a zigzag line made by twelve stars of the third and fourth magnitudes, the body 
of the reptile will soon be discovered, the two extremities of which are direct-
ed toward the north: five of these twelve stars however are in Ophiuchus.
In the year 1604 the scholars of Kepler discovered in the foot of Ophiu-
chus, near Theta, a star equal in brilliancy to one of the first magnitude. 
Though it had no apparent motion, there was no circumstance attending its ap-
pearance that would favour the opinion of its being a comet. About the be-
ginning of January, 1606, it totally disappeared. There are seven nebulae in 
the group.
Four kinds of serpents have been placed among the constellations. The 
first is called the Hydra, and is found below the Crab and the Lion; the second 
is Hydrus, near the south pole; the third is Draco, near the north pole; and 
the fourth, the one we have just described.
This constellation is bounded by Hercules, Bootes, Libra, Scorpio, Sagit-
tarius, Scutum Sobiesci, Antinous, and Aquila.
History.--According to ancient tradition, this figure represents the cele-
brated physician AEsculapius, son of Apollo, who was instructed in the healing 
art by Chiron the Centaur. The serpent, which is here placed in the hands of 
AEsculapius, is thought by some to be intended as an emblem of his sagacity 
and prudence; others imagine it was designed to denote his skill in healing 
the bite of this reptile. Some biblical critics have supposed that this constel-
lation is alluded to in the following passage from the book of Job: "By his 
spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked ser-
pent." We think, however, that the inspired writer here refers to Draco, be-
cause it is a more obvious constellation, it is nearer the pole, it is more ancient, 
and the Egyptian hieroglyphical figure for the heavens refers to Draco. Char-
din, the traveller, states that the Persians call this group of stars Eve and the 
Serpent. (Green, 53-55)</note>

                <note xml:id="ARIESGLOSS" resp="#DCH">It is not surprising to find a ram in the sky, for rams were frequently sacrificed
                    to the gods, and Zeus was at times identified with a ram. But the mythographers
                    agree that Aries is a special ram, the one whose golden fleece was the object of
                    the voyage of Jason and the Argonauts. This ram made its appearance on Earth
                    just as King Athamas of Boeotia was about to sacrifice his son Phrixus to ward
                    off an impending famine. King Athamas and his wife Nephele had an unhappy marriage, so Athamas
                    turned instead to Ino, daughter of King Cadmus from neighbouring Thebes.
                    Ino resented her step-children, Phrixus and Helle, and she arranged a plot to
                    have them killed. She began by parching the wheat so that the crops would fail.
                    When Athamas appealed for help to the Delphic Oracle, Ino bribed messengers
                    to bring back a false reply that Phrixus must be sacrificed to save the harvest.
                    Reluctantly, Athamas took his son to the top of Mount Laphystium, overlooking his palace at Orchomenus. He was about to sacrifice Phrixus to Zeus
                    when Nephele intervened to save her son, sending down from the sky a winged
                    ram with a golden fleece. Phrixus climbed on the ram’s back and was joined by
                    his sister Helle, who feared for her own life. They flew off eastwards to Colchis,
                    which lay on the eastern shore of the Black Sea, under the Caucasus Mountains
                    (the modern Georgia). On the way Helle’s grip failed and she fell into the
                    channel between Europe and Asia, the Dardanelles, which the Greeks named
                    the Hellespont in her memory. On reaching Colchis, Phrixus sacrificed the ram
                    in gratitude to Zeus. He presented its golden fleece to the fearsome King Aeëtes
                    of Colchis who, in return, gave Phrixus the hand of his daughter Chalciope.
                    Nephele placed the image of the ram among the stars.
                    Eratosthenes, though, said that the ram was immortal, which would have
                    made sacrificing it highly problematic. Instead, in this version, the ram itself shed its fleece and flew into the sky of its own accord. Either way, the lack of
                    the radiant fleece was said by the mythologists to account for the constellation’s
                    relative faintness.
                    After Phrixus died his ghost returned to Greece to haunt his cousin Pelias,
                    who had seized the throne of Iolcus in Thessaly. The true successor to the
                    throne was Jason. Pelias promised to give up the throne to Jason if he brought
                    home the golden fleece from Colchis. This was the challenge that led to the epic
                    voyage of Jason and the Argonauts.
                    When he reached Colchis, Jason first asked King Aeëtes politely for the
                    fleece, which hung on an oak in a sacred wood, guarded by a huge unsleeping
                    serpent. King Aeëtes rejected Jason’s request. Fortunately for the expedition, the
                    king’s daughter, Medea, fell in love with Jason and offered to help him steal the
                    fleece. At night the two crept into the wood where the golden fleece hung,
                    shining like a cloud lit by the rising Sun. Medea bewitched the serpent so that
                    it slept while Jason snatched the fleece.
                    According to Apollonius Rhodius, the fleece was as large as the hide of a
                    young cow, and when Jason slung it over his shoulder it reached his feet. The
                    ground shone from its glittering golden wool as Jason and Medea escaped with
                    it. Once free of the pursuing forces of King Aeëtes, Jason and Medea used the
                    fleece to cover their wedding bed. The final resting place of the fleece was in
                    the temple of Zeus at Orchomenus, where Jason hung it on his return to Greece.
                    The Greeks knew the constellation as Κριός (Krios), meaning ram; Aries is
                    the Latin name. On old star maps the ram is shown in a crouching position, but
                    without wings, its head turned back towards Taurus. In the sky it is not at all
                    prominent. Its most noticeable feature is a crooked line of three stars, which
                    marks its head. Of these three stars, Alpha Arietis is called Hamal, from the
                    Arabic for lamb; Beta Arietis is Sheratan, from the Arabic meaning ‘two’
                    of something (possibly two signs or two horns, for it was originally applied to
                    both this star and to its neighbour, Gamma Arietis); and Gamma Arietis is
                    Mesarthim, a curiously corrupted form of al-sharatan, the title which it originally
                    shared with Beta Arietis.
                    First point of Aries
                    In astronomy, Aries assumes a far greater importance than its brightness would
                    suggest, for in Greek times it contained the cardinal point known as the vernal
                    equinox. This is the point at which the Sun crosses the celestial equator from
                    north to south. But the vernal equinox is not stationary, because of the slow
                    wobble of the Earth’s axis known as precession.
                    When the Greek astronomer Hipparchus defined the position of the vernal
                    equinox around 130 BC this point lay south of the star Mesarthim (Gamma
                    Arietis). The zodiac was then taken to start from here, and so the vernal equinox
                    was commonly known as the first point of Aries. Because of precession, the
                    vernal equinox has moved some 30° since the time of Hipparchus and currently
                    lies in the neighbouring constellation Pisces. By the year 2600 it will have
                    entered Aquarius. Despite this, the vernal equinox is still sometimes called the
                    first point of Aries. (Ridpath, 47-49)

This sign is directly south of the Triangles. It contains 
but three stars of any obvious magnitude. The situation of Alpha in the head 
of Aries, may be found by drawing a line from Epsilon in the foot of Cassio-
peia, through Almaach in the foot of Andromeda, and then producing it a little 
to the south of the stars which compose Triangulum Majus. It may also be 
discovered by an imaginary line drawn from Delta of Perseus through Algol. 
The two other stars, Beta and Gamma, are very near Alpha, and will easily be 
recognised. Gamma is also called Mesarthim, and appears double when seen 
with a good telescope.
Aries is bounded by Musca, Triangula, Pisces, Cetus, and Taurus.
Aries is the first of the old zodiacal constellations. About four thousand 
years ago, the vernal equinoctial point entered this sign; but from its apparent 
motion towards the west, owing to the precession of the equinoxes, it is now 
found in the sign Pisces, within which it has remained about 2000 years.
Near the banks of the Nile, at Dendera, there is a dilapidated edifice, 
supposed by some to have been dedicated to Isis. Others imagine that it was 
devoted to astronomical purposes, from the circumstance that two zodiacs 
have been discovered, represented in different parts of the ruins. The first 
is carved at the two ends of the portico; six signs are on one side and six 
on the other. The second zodiac is figured on the ceiling of one of the inner 
apartments. On both these zodiacs the equinoctial point appears to be in the 
sign Leo, and not in Aries; for the Lion stands first in one of the semicircular 
portions on the portico, and is also found at the beginning of a spiral line in 
the interior of the building. From these facts it has been concluded, by those 
who are desirous of drawing from every source an argument against the chro-
nology of the Bible, that these zodiacs were constructed when the sun entered 
the sign Leo, which must have been more than ten thousand years before the 
birth of our Saviour. It has, however, been maintained, with equal plausibility, 
by writers not otherwise friendly to religion, that these zodiacs cannot be older 
than the Christian era, even on the supposition that the edifice at Dendera 
was an astronomical observatory, and not a temple of Isis--a fact by no means 
settled, and upon which the whole question rests. M. Letronne, in a late 
learned dissertation on Egyptian zodiacs, has, we think, demonstrated that they 
are merely the horoscopes of individuals, or the precise situation of the pla-
nets in the zodiac at their nativity; and therefore, so far from being monu-
ments of ancient science, they afford additional evidence of the universal cre-
dulity which for ages bowed the minds of men to the superstitions of astro-
logy. The idea that such was their purpose and origin, was first suggested by 
observing, in the box of a mummy, a zodiac similar to that at Dendera, and 
which by the aid of other characters, and particularly a Greek inscription, he 
was enabled to make out to be a horoscope. Landseer, in his Sabtean Re-
searches, page 243, declares "that the Denderanian temple is not of more 
ancient date than the time of the Ptolemies," and considers the carving in the 
inner apartment not intended for a zodiac or planisphere, in the same sense as 
we now use these terms. M. Saint Martin supposes that it refers to the 
rising of the Nile, when the sun enters Leo. There are, perhaps, no opinions 
more diametrically opposed to each other, than those of theorizing antiquaries. 
On almost every important question the contending parties, in point of num-
bers and reputation, neutralize themselves; and what Dr. Chalmers has said 
in his Evidences of Christianity relative to speculating geologists, may justly 
be applied to them. "Though our imaginations have been regaled by the 
brilliancy of their speculations, they are so opposite to each other, that we 
now cease to be impressed by their evidence." As the sign Leo commences 
the zodiac of Dendera, we shall give a description of this ancient relic of the 
arts when speaking of that constellation.
The following character, y, represents the sign of the Ram; a figure 
which bears some resemblance to the head and horns of that animal.
History.--The fabulous account of this sign is, that it symbolizes the ram 
which bore the golden fleece. Nephele, queen of Thebes, mother to Phryxus 
and Helle, being apprized of some murderous designs against her children, 
gave them this ram, on whose back they were to be carried through the air to 
their friend AEtes, king of Colchis. The rapid motion of the ram during their 
flight, and their elevation above the earth, made Helle giddy, and she dropped 
from the back of the ram into that part of the sea which was afterwards called 
the Hellespont. Phryxus arrived safe at his destination. Some time after, 
Phryxus was murdered at Colchis by those who envied him the possession of 
the golden fleece, and it was this murder which gave rise to the Argonautic 
expedition for the recovery of the fleece. This fable has been explained by 
some, who observe that Phryxus embarked from Thebes in a ship called the 
Ram, or that it carried on her prow the figure of that animal. The fleece of 
gold is an emblem of the immense treasures taken from Thebes in the ship.
Nephele, the mother of Phryxus, was changed into a cloud; for which 
reason the Greeks call the clouds by her name.
The most probable story of the origin of this sign, is as we have stated in 
our Illustrations of the First Plate; that is, that Aries was a hieroglyphical figure 
designed to represent a fact in natural history peculiar to that season in which 
the sun's place was at the time of its invention. 
n the Hebrew zodiac, Aries alludes to the tribe of Gad.
The litde constellation Musca, figured on tlus plate, is noticed in our Il-
lustrations of the Fourth Plate. (Green 63-65)</note>

                <note xml:id="CLYPEUSSOBIESKIGLOSS" resp="#DCH">This small asterism in the heavens was named by Hevelius in honour of 
John the Third, of the house of Sobieski, king of Poland. Its position is in the 
middle of the Milky Way, and may easily be found by three stars in the form 
of a small triangle. A line drawn from Kappa near the knee of Antinous, to-
wards Upsilon in the hand of Ophiuchus, will pass through this little triangle. 
Two stars of the fourth magnitude, not far from each other, on the edge of 
the shield, may be seen near Lambda of Antinous. In this shield and around 
it there are four or five singular nebulous appearances. (Green, 57)

The fifth-smallest constellation in the sky, introduced in 1684 by the Polish
astronomer Johannes Hevelius under the title Scutum Sobiescianum, Sobieski’s
Shield. He named it in honour of King John III Sobieski of Poland who helped
Hevelius rebuild his observatory after a disastrous fire in 1679.
Hevelius’s description and chart of the constellation first appeared in August
1684 in Acta Eruditorum, a leading scientific journal of the day. Hevelius quoted
Edmond Halley’s invention six years earlier of Robur Carolinum, honouring King Charles II of England, as the precedent. Robur Carolinum did not survive
but Scutum did, and is in fact the only constellation introduced for political
reasons that is still in use.
Even so, Scutum nearly didn’t make it. John Flamsteed ignored it in his
catalogue and atlas, listing its stars under Aquila, although he accepted six other
Hevelius inventions. Johann Bode reinstated it to the sky in his Uranometria of
1801 under the name Scutum Sobiesii (see illustration above). It was taken out
again by the English astronomer Francis Baily who omitted it from his influ -
ential British Association Catalogue of 1845. This tug-of-war was resolved by the
American astronomer Benjamin Gould, who included it as plain Scutum in his
Uranometria Argentina catalogue of 1879 and allocated Greek letters to its stars
for the first time, thereby cementing its permanence.
Scutum lies in a bright area of the Milky Way between Aquila to the north
and Sagittarius to the south and is distinctive despite its small size. Its brightest
stars are of only fourth magnitude, and none is named, but the constellation
contains a celebrated cluster of stars popularly known as the Wild Duck cluster
because its fan-shape resembles a flight of ducks. (Ridpath, 159-160)</note>

                <note xml:id="AURIGAGLOSS" resp="#DCH">High in the northern sky stands a forlorn-looking charioteer. With his right hand
                    he grasps the reins of a chariot, while on his left arm he carries a goat and its
                    two kids. Of his chariot itself there is no sign. What’s the story here? Mythology
                    offers several identifications for this prominent constellation, although the
                    presence of the goat is not accounted for by any of them.
                    The most popular interpretation is that he is Erichthonius, a legendary king
                    of Athens. Erichthonius was the son of Hephaestus the god of fire, better
                    known by his Roman name of Vulcan. Hephaestus was too busy smithying to
                    be bothered with his son, who was instead raised by the goddess Athene, after
                    whom the city of Athens is named. When he grew up, Erichthonius instituted
                    a festival called the Panathenaea in her honour.
                    Athene taught Erichthonius many skills, including how to tame horses. He
                    became the first person to harness four horses to a chariot, in imitation of the
                    four-horse chariot of the Sun (the quadriga), a bold move which earned him
                    the admiration of Zeus and assured him a place among the stars. There, according to this story, Erichthonius is depicted at the reins, perhaps participating in
                    the Panathenaic games in which he frequently drove his chariot to victory.
                    Another identification is that Auriga is really Myrtilus, the charioteer of King
                    Oenomaus of Pisa and son of Hermes. The king had a beautiful daughter,
                    Hippodamia, whom he was determined not to let go. He challenged each of
                    her suitors to a death-or-glory chariot race. They were to speed away with
                    Hippodamia on their chariots, but if Oenomaus caught up with them before
                    they reached Corinth he would kill them. Since he had the swiftest chariot in
                    Greece, skilfully driven by Myrtilus, no man had yet survived the test.
                    A dozen suitors had been beheaded by the time that Pelops, the handsome
                    son of Tantalus, came to claim Hippodamia’s hand. Hippodamia, falling in love
                    with him on sight, begged Myrtilus to betray the king so that Pelops might win
                    the race. Myrtilus, who was himself secretly in love with Hippodamia, tampered
                    with the pins holding the wheels on Oenomaus’s chariot. During the pursuit of
                    Pelops, the wheels of the king’s chariot fell off and Oenomaus was thrown to
                    his death.
                    Hippodamia was now left in the company of both Pelops and Myrtilus.
                    Pelops solved the awkward situation by unceremoniously casting Myrtilus
                    into the sea, from where he cursed the house of Pelops as he drowned. Hermes
                    put the image of his son Myrtilus into the sky as the constellation Auriga.
                    Germanicus Caesar supports this identification because, he says, ‘you will Hippodamia has been taken away by the treachery of Pelops’.
                    A third identification of Auriga is Hippolytus, son of Theseus, whose stepmother Phaedra fell in love with him. When Hippolytus rejected her, she
                    hanged herself in despair. Theseus banished Hippolytus from Athens. As he
                    drove away his chariot was wrecked, killing him. Asclepius the healer brought
                    the blameless Hippolytus back to life again, a deed for which Zeus struck
                    Asclepius down with a thunderbolt at the demand of Hades, who was annoyed
                    at losing a valuable soul.
                    Aratus did not identify the constellation with any character. He simply called
                    it Ἡνίοχος (Heniochos), the charioteer, as did Ptolemy in the Almagest. From this Greek name comes the Latin transliteration Heniochus, used for the constellation by some Roman writers such as Manilius.
                    The she-goat and kids
                    Auriga contains the sixth-brightest star in the sky, known as Capella, a Roman
                    name meaning ‘she-goat’; the Greeks called it Αἲξ (Aix), meaning the same.
                    Ptolemy in the Almagest described this star as being on the charioteer’s left
                    shoulder, but all major star atlases, including those of Bayer, Flamsteed, and
                    Bode (previous page), have shown it in the body of the goat. According to
                    Aratus it represented the goat Amaltheia, who suckled the infant Zeus on the
                    island of Crete and was placed in the sky as a mark of gratitude, along with the
                    two kids she bore at the same time.
                    The kids, frequently known by their Latin name of Haedi (Greek: Ἔριφοι,
                    i.e. Eriphoi), are represented by the neighbouring stars Eta and Zeta Aurigae;
                    Ptolemy described them as lying on the charioteer’s left wrist. Hyginus credits
                    the Greek astronomer Cleostratus with having first called these two stars the
                    kids in the 5th century BC. It is sometimes said that the variable star Epsilon
                    Aurigae to the north of them is a third member of the kids, but this is incorrect;
                    Ptolemy and the mythologists were clear that there were only two kids. According to Ptolemy, Epsilon Aurigae marks the charioteer’s left elbow.
                    An alternative story is that Amaltheia was not the goat itself but the nymph
                    who owned the goat. Eratosthenes says that the goat was so ugly that it terrified
                    the Titans who ruled the Earth at that time. When Zeus grew up he challenged
                    the Titans for supremacy. Following the advice of an oracle he skinned the goat
                    and made a cloak from its impenetrable hide, the back of which resembled the
                    head of a Gorgon. This horrible-looking goatskin formed the so-called aegis of
                    Zeus (the word aegis means ‘goatskin’). The aegis protected Zeus and scared his
                    enemies, a particular advantage in his fight against the Titans. Afterwards Zeus
                    covered the bones of the goat in a normal-looking skin and transformed it into
                    the star Capella.
                    Some early writers spoke of the Goat and Kids as a separate constellation,
                    but since the time of Ptolemy they have been awkwardly combined with the
                    charioteer, the goat resting on the charioteer’s shoulder, with the kids supported
                    on his forearm. There is no legend to explain why the charioteer is so encumbered with livestock.
                    A ‘shared’ star
                    Greek astronomers regarded one star as being shared by Auriga and Taurus.
                    Old star maps show this star as representing both the right foot of the charioteer
                    and also the tip of the bull’s left horn. When the German astronomer Johann
                    Bayer came to allocate Greek letters to the stars in the early 17th century he
                    designated this star as both Gamma Aurigae and Beta Tauri. However, since
                    the introduction of precise constellation boundaries in 1930, astronomers have
                    assigned this star exclusively to Taurus as Beta Tauri and there is no longer a
                    Gamma Aurigae. Hence, under the modern scheme, the bull has kept the tip
                    of his horn but the luckless charioteer has lost his right foot. (Ridpath, 50-52)

This constellation is remarkable for containing a beautiful 
star of the first magnitude, marked Alpha, and named also Capella, from its 
being in the body of a goat which Auriga supports in his arm. Capella is very 
near the Milky Way. A line drawn from Benetnasch through Omicron and 
Kappa in the fore foot of Ursa Major, and produced to a little more than four-
fifths of their distance from each other, will terminate at Capella. A better 
way perhaps to find it, is by drawing a line from the Pole star to Alpha in Cas-
siopeia: Capella will then form the summit of a triangle nearly isosceles, of 
which this line is the base. Between Capella and the Great Bear a star of the 
second magnitude in the shoulder of Auriga, marked Beta, will be seen. Del-
ta, in the head, a star of the fourth magnitude, forms the summit of a triangle, 
of which Alpha and Beta form the two angles at the base. To the south of 
Capella, in the Milky Way, there are three stars of the fourth magnitude, mark-
ed Epsilon, Eta, Zeta: these form a small elongated triangle, easily recognised. 
This figure encloses the representation of two kids, which always accompany 
Capella. In the southern foot there is a star, Gamma, of the second magni-
tude, which is common both to Auriga and the northern horn of the Bull: it 
forms an isosceles triangle with Capella and Beta. Iota, a star of the fourth 
magnitude in the northern foot, makes a quadrilateral figure with Alpha, Beta 
and Gamma, as represented on the plate. The right arm, and the hand of 
Auriga which holds a bridle, are located by two stars of the fourth magnitude, 
marked Theta and Kappa. A line drawn from Capella diagonally through 
the space between Beta in the shoulder and Gamma in the southern foot, will 
enable the observer to find it very easily. There are numerous stars of the 
fifth and sixth magnitude, in the Milky Way, but which are not delineated 
on our plate; these assume the form of a cross, the principal arm of which 
lies between Gamma and Alpha. Other figures may be formed with the 
minute stars of this constellation. There are three nebulous appearances in 
this group.
Auriga is bounded by Camelopardalis, Perseus, Taurus, Gemini, Telesco-
pium Herschelii, and Lynx.
History.--It is supposed by some that this constellation represents Erich-
thonius, a king of Athens, who was deified and placed among the stars on ac-
count of his numerous and useful inventions, but more particularly for his 
construction of chariots. In allusion to this, Virgil, in the third book of 
his Georgics, has the following lines: 
"Primus Erichthonius currus et quatuor ausus
Jungere equos, rapidisque rotis insistere victor."
Other writers say that Bootes invented the chariot, and that Auriga was the 
son of Mercury, charioteer to CEnomaus, king of Pisa, in Elis. This man was 
so skilful in the management of horses that he rendered the steeds of his mas-
ter the swiftest in all Greece. Unfaithfulness, however, proved his ruin; but 
inasmuch as he was the son of Mercury, he was after his death removed to 
the stars. Others again have imagined that the constellation Auriga has some 
reference to the interesting fable of Phaeton. The goat which Auriga holds 
on his arm, according to some mythologists, is Amalthea, that supported Jupi-
ter in his infancy, and which, as a reward for her kindness, he placed here in 
the heavens. Much doubt hangs over the history of this goat and her kids: 
if the goat be Amalthea, why should it be placed in the arms of Auriga? (Green, 33-4)</note>

                <note xml:id="TAURUSPONIATOWSKIGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Everyone has heard of the zodiacal constellation of Taurus the bull, but far less
                    well-known is that there was once a much smaller bull in the sky as well. This
                    little bull, tucked awkwardly between Ophiuchus and Aquila and overlapped
                    by the tail of Serpens, was originated in 1777 by Martin Poczobut (1728–1810),
                    director of the Royal Observatory at Vilna (now Vilnius, Lithuania). Poczobut
                    invented it to honour his king, Stanisław August Poniatowski, who was monarch
                    of both Poland and Lithuania. King Stanisław was a noted patron of the arts
                    and sciences, and the bull was a feature of his family’s coat of arms.
                    The face of the little bull was formed by a V-shaped group of stars between
                    the right shoulder of Ophiuchus and the tail of Serpens. This group reminded
                    Poczobut of the Hyades cluster that outlines the face of Taurus the bull in the
                    zodiac. Four of these had been listed by Ptolemy as ‘unformed’ stars outside
                    Ophiuchus. A fifth unformed star listed by Ptolemy lay on the bull’s right horn
                    and was the brightest of the constellation, magnitude 3.7. The rest of the body
                    was fleshed out by fainter stars. The constellation was first depicted in 1778 as le Taureau Royal de Poniatowski in a revised reprint of Jean Fortin’s Atlas Céleste.
                    Bode later Latinized its name to Taurus Poniatovii on his Uranographia of 1801
                    (see illustration above).
                    Poczobut did not realize it but his short-lived creation contained the faint red
                    dwarf known as Barnard’s Star, now known to be the second-closest star to
                    the Sun, 5.9 light years away. It lay in the bull’s head, near the present-day
                    66 Ophiuchi. Sadly, Poniatowski’s bull did not last long in the sky before being
                    put out to pasture and its stars are now part of Ophiuchus and Serpens Cauda. (Ridpath, 204-5)

Taurus Poniatovii, or the Bull of Poniatowski, is a small constellation 
in the Milky Way, contiguous to the shoulder of Ophiuchus, and appears to 
form part of that group. It was first arranged by the Abbe Poczobut, in 1778, 
in honour of Stanislaus Poniatowski, king of Poland. It may be known by four 
stars of the fourth magnitude, arranged in the figure of the letter V, very much 
in the same manner as the stars which form the head of Taurus in the Zodiac. 
It was, no doubt, this resemblance that suggested the name which has been 
applied to this group. (Green, 55)</note>

                <note xml:id="GRUSGLOSS" resp="#DCH">One of the 12 constellations introduced at the end of the 16th century by the
                    Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman after their
                    pioneer observations of the southern skies. Grus represents a long-necked
                    wading bird, the crane. Possibly they had in mind the sarus crane of India and
                    southeast Asia, which is the largest species of crane, standing nearly 6 ft tall.
                    The constellation was first shown on a celestial globe by Petrus Plancius and
                    Jodocus Hondius in 1598 under the name Krane Grus, respectively Dutch and
                    Latin words for crane. De Houtman called it Den Reygher, the heron, in his
                    southern star catalogue of 1603, but Johann Bayer adopted the original name
                    Grus for the constellation in his Uranometria atlas of 1603.
                    A second alternative title, Phoenicopterus, the flamingo, first appeared in
                    1605 in the Cosmographiae Generalis of Paul Merula (1558–1607), the librarian of
                    Leiden University, who got his information on the new southern constellations
                    from Plancius. The name Phoenicopterus appeared again on a globe produced
                    around 1625 by the Dutch globe maker Pieter van den Keere (1571–c.1646)
                    (Petrus Kaerius in Latin), another Plancius collaborator. However, probably due to the influence of Bayer’s highly popular atlas, the original identification as a
                    crane won out.
                    Grus was formed from stars south of Piscis Austrinus, the southern fish. In
                    fact, the star we now know as Gamma Gruis, marking the crane’s head, was
                    taken over from the original Greek Piscis Austrinus – Ptolemy described it in
                    the Almagest as lying on the tip of the fish’s tail. Bayer and others straightened
                    out the tail of Piscis Austrinus so that it did not overlap with the head of Grus.
                    The constellation’s brightest star, second-magnitude Alpha Gruis, is named
                    Alnair, from an abbreviation of the Arabic al-nayyir min dhanab al-ḥūt meaning
                    ‘the bright one from the fish’s tail’. This name arose because Arab astronomers
                    in the 16th century had extended the tail of Piscis Austrinus southwards beyond
                    the Ptolemaic limits of the constellation; it was never part of the original Greek
                    version. There are no legends associated with Grus, but in Greek mythology the
                    crane was sacred to Hermes. (Ripath, 100-1)

<!--In Green, Grus is combined with Sculptoris and Phoenix.-->Grus, or the Crane, is south of Piscis Notus. It contains one star of the 
second magnitude, two of the third, and two of the fourth. A small portion 
only of this group is visible in our latitude. (Green, 93)</note>

                <note xml:id="ANTINOUSGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Antinous (pronounced ‘anti-no-us’) was the boy lover of the Roman Emperor
                    Hadrian and hence is a real character, not a mythological one, although the
                    story reads like fiction. Antinous was born c. AD 110 in the town of Bythinium
                    (also called Claudiopolis), near present-day Bolu in north-western Turkey. At that time the area was a Roman province, and Hadrian is thought to have met
                    Antinous during an official visit. Hadrian, the first openly gay Roman Emperor,
                    was smitten by the boy and groomed him to become his constant companion.
                    Hadrian’s happiness did not last long, though. While on a trip up the Nile in
                    AD 130 Antinous drowned near the present-day town of Mallawi in Egypt.
                    Supposedly an oracle had predicted that the Emperor would be saved from
                    danger by the sacrifice of the object he most loved, and Antinous realized that
                    this description applied to him. Whether the drowning was accident, suicide, or
                    even ritual sacrifice, Hadrian was heartbroken by it. He founded a city called
                    Antinoöpolis near the site of the drowning, declared Antinous a god, and commemorated him in the sky from stars south of Aquila, the eagle, that had
                    not previously been considered part of any constellation.
                    Antinous was mentioned as a sub-division of Aquila in Ptolemy’s Almagest,
                    although it is not included among the canonical 48 Greek figures. Ptolemy
                    worked at Alexandria at the mouth of the Nile and he compiled the Almagest
                    about 20 years after the famous drowning so he would have known the story;
                    indeed, he might have had a hand in creating the constellation, possibly at
                    Hadrian’s request.
                    The constellation’s first known depiction was in 1536 on a celestial globe by
                    the German mathematician and cartographer Caspar Vopel (1511–61); it was
                    shown again in 1551 on a globe by Gerardus Mercator. Tycho Brahe listed it as
                    a separate constellation in his star catalogue of 1602 and it remained widely
                    accepted into the 19th century, when it was eventually remerged with Aquila.
                    Antinous was depicted being carried in the talons of Aquila. Hence he has
                    sometimes been confused with Ganymede, another celestial catamite, who was
                    carried off by an eagle for Zeus. (Ridpath, 185-7)

Antinous is represented on the maps as a youth in a kneel-
ing posture, sometimes with a bow and arrow in his hand. The constellation 
is near the Milky Way, immediately south of Aquila. It contains five stars of 
the third magnitude. Theta in the arm, Eta in the shoulder, Iota in the side, 
and Kappa in the knee, form a quadrilateral figure. Lambda, the fifth star in 
the foot, may be found by drawing a line from Theta in the arm diagonally 
through the space between Iota and Kappa. The star Eta, is variable in 
brightness: its greatest lustre continues about forty hours; it then gradually 
diminishes for sixty-six hours, and when it has reached its smallest magnitude, 
it appears to remain stationary for the space of thirty hours, after which it 
again increases. A cluster of very minute stars has been discovered in the 
northern foot of Antinous.
Antinous is bounded by Aquila, Scutum Sobiesci, Sagittarius, Capricornus, 
Aquarius, and Delphinus.
History.--Tycho placed this constellation in the heavens to perpetuate
the memory of a youth much esteemed by the emperor Adrian. Antinous 
was a native of Bithynia in Asia Minor. So greatly was his death lamented 
by Adrian, that he erected a temple to his memory, and built in honour of him 
a splendid city on the banks of the Nile, the ruins of which are still visited by 
travellers with much interest. As this constellation is often united to Aquila, 
and the whole considered as but one group, some writers assert that the figure 
which accompanies the Eagle is not Antinous, but Ganymede; thus referring 
the whole to one of the exploits of Jupiter. (Green, 56-7)</note>

                <note xml:id="SAGITTAGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Sagitta is the third-smallest constellation in the sky, and has no stars brighter
                    than fourth magnitude, but it was well-known to the Greeks and was among the
                    48 constellations listed by Ptolemy in the Almagest. Aratus described it as ‘alone,
                    without a bow’ since there is no sign of the archer who might have shot it.
                    Aratus and Ptolemy knew it by the Greek name Ὀϊστός (Oistos), but puzzlingly
                    Eratosthenes called it Τόξον (Toxon) which means ‘bow’ rather than ‘arrow’.
                    An alternative Latin name for the constellation widely used prior to the 18th
                    century was Telum, meaning a dart or spear. There are at least three different stories to account for the arrow in the sky.
                    Eratosthenes said it was the projectile with which Apollo killed the Cyclopes
                    because they made the thunderbolts of Zeus that struck down Apollo’s son,
                    Asclepius. According to this story, Asclepius was a great healer with the power
                    to raise the dead, but Zeus killed Asclepius when Hades, god of the Underworld, complained that he was losing business. Asclepius is commemorated in
                    the constellation Ophiuchus.
                    Hyginus, on the other hand, said that Sagitta was one of the arrows with
                    which Heracles killed the eagle that ate the liver of Prometheus. It was
                    Prometheus who moulded men out of clay in the likeness of the gods, and
                    gave them fire that he had stolen from Zeus. Prometheus carried the fire
                    triumphantly in a vegetable stalk like a runner bearing the Olympic torch. Zeus
                    cruelly punished him for this theft by chaining him to Mount Caucasus, where
                    a long-winged eagle ate his liver during the day. But at night the liver grew again
                    for the eagle to resume his feast in the morning. Heracles freed Prometheus from
                    this eternal torture by shooting the eagle with an arrow.
                    Germanicus Caesar identified Sagitta as the arrow of Eros which kindled in
                    Zeus his passion for the shepherd boy Ganymede, who is commemorated by
                    the constellation Aquarius. Now, according to Germanicus, the arrow is guarded
                    in the sky by the eagle of Zeus – and Sagitta does indeed lie next to the constellation of the eagle, Aquila.
                    Alpha Sagittae, magnitude 4.4, has the strange-sounding name Sham, which
                    comes from the Arabic name for the constellation, al-sahm, meaning ‘the arrow’.
                    The constellation’s brightest star is actually Gamma Sagittae, magnitude 3.5,
                    which Ptolemy described as lying on the arrow-head; however, the atlases of
                    Flamsteed and Bode extended the shaft beyond Gamma to Eta Sagittae, as in
                    the illustration below, a star that Ptolemy did not list. (Ridpath, 152-3)

This pretty constellation is in the Milky Way, a little 
to the south of the head of Cygnus. It may be known by four stars of the 
fourth magnitude, three of which are in a straight line. Beta, the fourth star, 
is a little to the south of Alpha. The other stars in this group are very mi-
nute. Alpha and Beta indicate the plume, and Gamma and Delta the body of 
the Arrow. A small nebula, very pale, is to be found near Delta.
Sagitta is bounded by Vulpecula et Anser, Cerberus, Aquila, and Del-
phinus.
History.--The Greeks say that this constellation owes its origin to one of 
the arrows with which Hercules killed the vulture that gnawed, without di-
minishing, the liver of Prometheus. Jupiter punished Prometheus in this man-
ner for his impiety. He is generally represented, fastened on a rock, at the 
moment that Hercules kills with this arrow, the bird which preys upon his 
vitals. (Green, 47)</note>

                <note xml:id="CORONAAUSTRALISGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Corona Australis was known to the Greeks not as a crown but as a wreath,
                    which is how it is depicted on old star maps. Aratus did not name it as a separate
                    constellation but referred to it simply as a circlet of stars beneath the forefeet of
                    Sagittarius. Perhaps it has slipped off the archer’s head.
                    The first recorded mention of Corona Australis as a separate constellation
                    appears to be in the first century BC by the Greek astronomer and mathematician Geminus of Rhodes in his survey of astronomy called Introduction to the
                    Phenomena. He gave it the name Νότιος στέφανος (Notios stephanos, the southern
                    crown), whereas Ptolemy in the Almagest two centuries later reversed the name
                    as Στέφανος νότιος (Stephanos notios). The northern crown, which we call
                    Corona Borealis, was known to the Greeks simply as Στέφανος (Stephanos).
                    None of the stars of Corona Australis is brighter than fourth magnitude and
                    there seem to be no legends associated with it, unless this is the crown placed in
                    the sky by Dionysus after retrieving his dead mother from the Underworld.
                    Hyginus gives this myth under the Northern Crown (Corona Borealis) but it
                    seems out of place there and he may have confused the two constellations. If
                    so, the wreath would be made of myrtle leaves, for Dionysus left a gift of myrtle
                    in Hades in return for his mother, and the followers of Dionysus wore crowns
                    of myrtle. (Ridpath, 80)

Corona Australis, or the Southern Crown, is a small asterism, between 
the fore feet of Sagittarius. It contains about twelve minute stars. It is repre-
sented on the maps by a wreath of leaves.
Pavo et Indus, or the Peacock and Indian, may be considered as but one 
constellation. This group is on the south polar circle, and contains some very 
fine stars; but our plan does not embrace a particular description of them. A 
fine star, marked Alpha, is in the eye of the Peacock. (Green, 86)</note>

                <note xml:id="DELPHINUSGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Dolphins were a familiar sight to Greek sailors, so it is not surprising to find one
                    of these friendly and intelligent creatures depicted in the sky. Two stories
                    account for the presence of the celestial dolphin. According to Eratosthenes,
                    this jaunty dolphin represents the messenger of the sea god Poseidon.
                    After Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades had overthrown their father Cronus, they
                    divided up the sky, the sea, and the underworld between them, with Poseidon
                    inheriting the sea. He built himself a magnificent underwater palace off the
                    island of Euboea. For all its opulence, the palace felt empty without a wife, so
                    Poseidon set out in search of one. He courted Amphitrite, one of the group of
                    sea nymphs called Nereids, but she fled from his rough advances and took refuge
                    among the other Nereids. Poseidon sent messengers after her, including a
                    dolphin, which found her and with soothing gestures brought her back to the sea god, whom she subsequently married. In gratitude, Poseidon placed the
                    image of the dolphin among the stars.
                    Another story, given by Hyginus and Ovid, says that this is the dolphin that
                    saved the life of Arion, a real-life poet and musician of the seventh century BC.
                    Arion was born on the island of Lesbos, but his reputation spread throughout
                    Greece for he was said to be unequalled in his skill with the lyre. While Arion
                    was returning to Greece by ship from a concert tour of Sicily and southern Italy,
                    the sailors plotted to kill him and steal the small fortune that he had earned.
                    When the sailors surrounded him with swords drawn, Arion asked to be
                    allowed to sing one last song. His music attracted a school of dolphins which
                    swam alongside the ship, leaping playfully. Placing his faith in the gods, Arion
                    leaped overboard – and one of the dolphins carried him on its back to Greece,
                    where Arion later confronted his attackers and had them sentenced to death.
                    Apollo, god of music and poetry, placed the dolphin among the constellations,
                    along with the lyre of Arion which is represented by the constellation Lyra.
                    Delphinus was known in Greek as Δελφίν (Delphin) or Δελφίς (Delphis).
                    Two stars in Delphinus bear the peculiar names Sualocin and Rotanev, which
                    first appeared in the Palermo Catalogue of 1814 compiled by the Italian astron -
                    omer Giuseppe Piazzi (1746–1826). Read backwards, these names spell out
                    Nicolaus Venator, the Latinized form of Niccolò Cacciatore (1770–1841), who
                    was Piazzi’s assistant and eventual successor at Palermo Observatory. It is
                    usually said that Cacciatore was responsible for the naming, which would make
                    him the only person to have named a star after himself and got away with it.
                    However, it is equally possible that the names were applied by Piazzi to honour
                    his heir apparent, or ‘dauphin’ (dolphin).
                    The constellation was once popularly called Job’s Coffin, presumably from
                    its elongated box-like shape, although sometimes this name is restricted to the
                    diamond formed by the four stars Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta Delphini.
                    Who originated the name Job’s Coffin, or when, is not known. (Ridpath, 88-9)

This little constellation is contiguous to Aquila, and may 
very readily be found by four stars of the third magnitude in the figure of a 
small rhombus; these are in the head of the Dolphin. This rhomboidal figure 
is the vertex of an isosceles triangle, of which Alpha in the Eagle and Alpha 
in the Arrow form the other angles. Epsilon, the fifth star of the third mag-
nitude in the Dolphin, is a little to the south of the rhombus. These five stars 
make up almost the whole of this beautiful little group.
Delphinus is bounded by Vulpecula, Sagitta, Aquila, Equuleus, and Pe-
gasus.
History.--According to some writers, this is the Dolphin which saved the 
life of Arion, the famous lyric poet and musician of Lesbos. The following 
are the most interesting particulars of that event. Arion, who had obtained 
immense riches in Italy by his professional skill, resolved to return with his 
wealth to his native country. The sailors of the ship in which he had em-
barked, determined to murder him to obtain his riches. Aware of their in-
famous designs, he begged to be permitted before his death to play some me-
lodious tunes, which as soon as he had finished he threw himself into the sea. 
A number of Dolphins had been attracted round the ship by the sweetness of 
the music, and it is said that one of them supported Arion on his back, and 
brought him safe to land. Whatever may have given rise to this story, the 
ancients agree in representing the Dolphin as the friend and protector of man.
Delphinus is said to have been placed among the constellations by Neptune. (Green, 58-9)</note>

                <note xml:id="ARAGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Altars feature frequently in Greek legend, for heroes were always making sacrifices to the gods, so it is not surprising to find an altar among the stars. But this
                    altar is a special one, for it was used by the gods themselves to swear a vow of
                    allegiance before their fight against the Titans, according to Eratosthenes and
                    Manilius. That clash, known as the Titanomachy, was one of the most significant events in Greek myth.
                    At that time the ruler of the Universe was Cronus, one of the 12 Titans.
                    Cronus had overthrown his father, Uranus, but it was prophesied that he would
                    in turn be deposed by one of his own sons. In a desperate attempt to forestall
                    the prophesy, Cronus swallowed his children as they were born: Hestia, Demeter,
                    Hera, Hades, and Poseidon, all ultimately destined to become gods and
                    goddesses. Eventually his wife, Rhea, could not bear to see any more children
                    swallowed. She smuggled the next child, Zeus, to the cave of Dicte in Crete and
                    gave Cronus a stone to swallow instead, telling him it was the infant Zeus.
                    On Crete, Zeus grew up safely. When he reached maturity he returned to his
                    father’s palace and forced Cronus to vomit up the children he had swallowed,
                    who emerged as fully grown gods and goddesses. Zeus and his brother gods then set up an altar and vowed on it to overthrow the callous rule of Cronus and the
                    other Titans.
                    The battle raged for ten years between the Titans, led by Atlas, on Mount
                    Othrys, and the gods led by Zeus on Mount Olympus. To break the deadlock
                    Mother Earth (Gaia) instructed Zeus to release the ugly brothers of the Titans,
                    whom Cronus had imprisoned in the sunless caves of Tartarus, the lowermost
                    region of the Underworld. There were two sets of brothers, the Hecatoncheires
                    (hundred-handed giants) and the one-eyed Cyclopes, and they wanted revenge
                    against Cronus.
                    Zeus stole down to Tartarus, released the monstrous creatures and asked
                    them to join him in the battle raging above. Delighted by their unexpected
                    freedom, the Cyclopes set to work to help the gods. They fashioned a helmet of
                    darkness for Hades, a trident for Poseidon and, above all, thunderbolts for Zeus.
                    With these new weapons and their monstrous allies, the gods routed the Titans.
                    After their victory, the gods cast lots to divide up the Universe. Poseidon
                    became lord of the sea, Hades won the Underworld and Zeus was allotted the
                    sky. Zeus then placed the altar of the gods in the sky as the constellation Ara in
                    lasting gratitude for their victory over the Titans.
                    The Greek name for the constellation was θυμιατήριον (Thymiaterion),
                    referring to an incense burner or censer. Aratus shortened this to θυτήριον
                    (Thyterion). An alternative Latin name widely encountered prior to the 18th
                    century was Thuribulum, with the same meaning. The altar is usually depicted
                    with its base to the north and its flames rising southwards, as described by
                    Ptolemy in the Almagest. Some atlases depict Ara as the altar on which Centaurus
                    is about to sacrifice Lupus, the wolf.
                    The Greeks regarded Ara as a sign of storms at sea. According to Aratus, if
                    the altar was visible while other stars were covered by cloud, mariners could
                    expect southerly gales. (Ridpath, 46-7)

                    <!--In Green, Ara is combined with Lupus.-->These two asterisms are just below the Scorpion. Lupus, or the Wolf, is 
one of the southern constellations, the upper part only of which is visible in 
our latitude. Its position is nearly due south of Antares. It contains stars of 
the third and fourth magnitudes. On the old Egyptian planispheres, Lupus is 
combined with a neighbouring group called the Centaur. The poets tell us 
that this is the wolf into which Lycaon, king of Arcadia, was changed on ac-
count of his cruelty.
Ara, or the Altar, contains three stars of the third magnitude, and three 
of the fourth. A part of this group is in the Milky Way. (Green, 85-86)</note>

                <note xml:id="CANESVENATICIGLOSS" resp="#DCH">The Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius formed this constellation in 1687
                    from a scattering of faint stars beneath the tail of Ursa Major. Canes Venatici
                    represents a pair of hounds held on a lead by Boötes, snapping at the heels of
                    the great bear. The constellation’s two brightest stars, Alpha and Beta Canum
                    Venaticorum, both lie in the southern dog.
                    Ptolemy had listed both these stars in the Almagest as among the ‘unformed’
                    stars outside the figure of the great bear, not belonging to any particular constellation, so they were free to be used in a new figure. Earlier in the 17th
                    century the Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius had introduced a new constellation called Jordanus, the river Jordan, that started in this area (see page 195),
                    but Hevelius replaced it with three inventions of his own: Canes Venatici, Leo
                    Minor, and Lynx.
                    The idea of dogs being held by Boötes was not original to Hevelius. On a
                    star chart published in 1533 the German astronomer Peter Apian (1495–1552)
                    showed Boötes with two dogs at his heels and holding their leash in his right
                    hand. On another chart published by Apian three years later the number of
                    dogs had grown to three and the leash had moved to the left hand, but they were
                    still following Boötes and not the bear. In neither case was any attempt made to
                    connect the dogs with charted stars, nor were they named, so the credit for
                    showing the dogs in their current position and for making them a separate
                    constellation remains with Hevelius.
                    Charles’s Heart, and a Whirlpool
                    Where the southern dog’s lead is attached to its collar lies the star Alpha Canum
                    Venaticorum, known as Cor Caroli, meaning Charles’s Heart, in honour of
                    King Charles I of England who was executed by parliamentarians in 1649. The
                    star was given this title by Charles Scarborough, physician to Charles’s son,
                    King Charles II, before Canes Venatici was formed. Scarborough reputedly said
                    that this star shone particularly brightly on the night of 1660 May 29, when
                    Charles II returned to London at the Restoration of the Monarchy. Because of
                    this there has been much confusion over which King Charles the star is intended
                    to commemorate, but it definitely refers to the first King Charles.
                    The name first appeared on a chart of 1673 by the English cartographer
                    Francis Lamb (fl.1670–1700), who labelled it Cor Caroli Regis Martyris, a
                    reference to the fact that King Charles I was beheaded (or ‘martyred’, as Lamb
                    loyally put it). Lamb and others, such as the ardent royalist Edward Sherburne
                    in 1675, drew a heart around the star surmounted by a crown, turning it into a
                    mini-constellation. Johann Bode, in his Uranographia atlas of 1801, retained the
                    heart and crown on the neck of the southern dog, but erred by calling the star
                    Cor Caroli II, thinking that it referred to the second King Charles. Despite its
                    overtly nationalistic nature, the name has stuck.
                    Beta Canum Venaticorum, on the dog’s snout, is called Chara, from the
                    Greek for ‘joy’, also the name that Hevelius gave the southern dog. The northern dog, which Hevelius called Asterion (‘little star’), is marked only by a
                    scattering of faint stars. Bode drew the dogs with their names engraved on their
                    collars. Alpha and Beta Canum Venaticorum are the only two stars in the constellation with Greek letters, which they were given by the English astronomer
                    Francis Baily in his British Association Catalogue of 1845.
                    Canes Venatici contains a beautiful spiral galaxy, M51, called the Whirlpool.
                    M51 was the first galaxy in which spiral form was noticed, by the Irish astron -
                    omer Lord Rosse (1800–67) in 1845. It consists of a large galaxy about 25
                    million light years away in near-collision with a smaller one; it is thought that
                    the two galaxies may eventually merge. (Ridpath, 59-60)

This modern constellation was introduced into the celestial charts by He-
velius. It occupies a considerable space between Bootes and Ursa Major. 
The northern dog is called Asterion, and the southern Chara. These dogs 
are represented as barking at the Great Bear, and Bootes, as he holds the cord 
to which they are fastened, is from this circumstance often called the Bear 
Driver. The stars in this group are all of the filth and sixth magnitudes, ex-
cept two in the head and neck of Chara. Alpha, the star in the neck, is Cor 
Caroli, which we represented on our second plate. This star forms an isos-
celes triangle with Eta and Gamma of the Great Bear. Delta, a star of the 
fourth magnitude, is in the eye of Chara. In the head of Asterion we find a 
small nebulous appearance, which shines with a faint light, surrounded by 
three small stars. (Green, 51)</note>

                <note xml:id="TAURUSGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Taurus (Ταῦρος in Greek) is a distinctive constellation, with star-tipped horns
                    and a head defined by a V-shaped group of stars. Two Greek bull-myths are
                    associated with Taurus. Usually it was said to represent Zeus in the disguise he
                    adopted for another of his extramarital affairs, this time as the bull that carried
                    away Europa, daughter of King Agenor of Phoenicia.
                    Europa liked to play on the beach with the other girls of Tyre. Zeus instruc -
                    ted his son Hermes to drive the king’s cattle from their pastures on the mountain
                    slopes towards the shore where the girls were playing. Adopting the shape of a
                    bull, Zeus surreptitiously mingled with the lowing herd, awaiting his chance to
                    abduct Europa. There was no mistaking who was the most handsome bull. His
                    hide was white as fresh snow and his horns shone like polished metal.
                    Europa was entranced by this beautiful yet placid creature. She adorned his
                    horns with flowers and stroked his flanks, admiring the muscles on his neck and
                    the folds of skin on his flanks. The bull kissed her hands, while inwardly Zeus
                    could hardly contain himself in anticipation of the final conquest. The bull lay
                    on the golden sands and Europa ventured to sit on his back. At first, she feared
                    nothing when the bull rose and began to paddle in the surf. But she became
                    alarmed when it began to swim strongly out to sea. Europa looked around in
                    dismay at the receding shoreline and clung tightly to the bull’s horns as waves
                    washed over the bull’s back. Craftily, Zeus the bull dipped more deeply into the
                    water to make her hold him more tightly still.
                    By now, Europa had realized that this was no ordinary bull. Eventually, the
                    bull waded ashore at Crete, where Zeus revealed his true identity and seduced
                    her. He gave her presents that included a dog that later became the constellation
                    Canis Major. The offspring of Zeus and Europa included Minos, king of Crete,
                    who established the famous palace at Knossos where bull games were held.
                    An alternative story says that Taurus may represent Io, another illicit love of
                    Zeus, whom the god turned into a heifer to disguise her from his wife Hera. But
                    Hera was suspicious and set the hundred-eyed watchman Argus to guard the heifer. Hera, furious at this, sent a gadfly to chase the heifer, who threw herself
                    into the sea and swam away.
                    In the sky, only the front half of the bull is shown. This can be explained
                    mythologically by assuming that the hind quarters are submerged. In reality,
                    there is no space in the sky to show the complete bull, for it is too big. The
                    constellations Cetus and Aries lie where the bull’s hind quarters would other -
                    wise be. Taurus shares with Pegasus this uncomfortable fate of having been
                    sliced in half in the sky. Adding to the awkwardness, Taurus moves across the
                    sky backwards, as though retreating from Orion.
                    Aratus described the bull as ‘crouching’, and star maps have traditionally
                    depicted Taurus with its front legs folded, perhaps lowering itself to entice
                    Europa onto its back. Manilius described the bull as lame and drew a mawkish
                    moral from it: ‘The sky teaches us to undergo loss with fortitude, since even
                    constellations are fashioned with limbs deformed’, he wrote.
                    The Hyades – the face of the bull
                    The face of Taurus is marked by the V-shaped group of stars called the Hyades
                    (Ὑάδες in Greek). Ovid in his Fasti asserts that the name comes from the old
                    Greek word hyein, meaning ‘to rain’, so that Hyades means ‘rainy ones’, because
                    their rising at certain times of year was said to be a sign of rain. In mythology
                    the Hyades were the daughters of Atlas and Aethra the Oceanid. Their eldest
                    brother was Hyas, a bold hunter who one day was killed by a lioness. His sisters
                    wept inconsolably – Hyginus says they died of grief – and for this they were
                    placed in the sky. Hence it seems equally likely that their name comes from their
                    brother Hyas. In another story, the Hyades were nymphs who nursed the infant
                    Dionysus in their cave on Mount Nysa, feeding him on milk and honey. The
                    Romans had a different name: they called the Hyades suculae meaning ‘piglets’.
                    The mythographers were massively confused about the names and even the
                    number of the Hyades. They are variously described as being five or seven in
                    number. Ptolemy listed five Hyades in his star catalogue. Hyginus alone gives
                    four different lists of their names, none of which agrees completely with the list
                    of five given originally by Hesiod, namely Phaesyle, Coronis, Cleia, Phaeo, and
                    Eudore. Astronomers have avoided the problem by not naming any of the stars
                    of the Hyades.
                    The Hyades is a genuine cluster of stars lying about 150 light years away.
                    Binoculars and small telescopes show many more members of the Hyades than
                    are visible to the naked eye. In all, the cluster is estimated to contain several
                    hundred stars.
                    The Pleiades – seven celestial sisters
                    Even more famous than the Hyades is another star cluster in Taurus: the
                    Pleiades (Πλειάδες in Greek), commonly known as the Seven Sisters. To a
                    casual glance, the Pleiades cluster appears as a fuzzy patch like a swarm of flies
                    over the back of the bull. According to Hyginus, some ancient astronomers
                    called them the bull’s tail. So distinctive are the Pleiades that the ancient Greeks
                    regarded them as a separate mini-constellation and used them as a calendar marker. Hesiod, in his agricultural poem Works and Days, instructs farmers to
                    begin harvesting when the Pleiades rise at dawn, which in Greek times would
                    have been in May, and to plough when they set at dawn, which would have been
                    in November. Ptolemy did not list individual members of the Pleiades in his
                    Almagest, giving only an indication of the cluster’s size.
                    In mythology the Pleiades were the seven daughters of Atlas and the oceanid
                    Pleione, after whom they are named. One popular derivation is that the name
                    comes from the Greek word plein, meaning ‘to sail’ – so Pleione means ‘sailing
                    queen’ and the Pleiades are the ‘sailing ones’, because in Greek times they were
                    visible all night during the summer sailing season. When the Pleiades vanished
                    from the night sky, it was considered prudent to remain ashore. ‘Gales of all
                    winds rage when the Pleiades, pursued by violent Orion, plunge into the
                    clouded sea’, wrote Hesiod.
                    Alternatively, and possibly more likely, the name may come from the old
                    Greek word pleos, ‘full’, which in the plural meant ‘many’, a suitable reference to the cluster. According to other authorities, the name comes from the Greek
                    word peleiades, meaning ‘flock of doves’.
                    Unlike their half-sisters the Hyades, the names of all seven Pleiades are
                    assigned to stars in the cluster: Alcyone, Asterope, Celaeno, Electra, Maia,
                    Merope, and Taygeta. Two more stars are named after their parents, Atlas and
                    Pleione. Alcyone is the brightest star in the cluster. According to mythology,
                    Alcyone and Celaeno were both seduced by Poseidon. Maia, the eldest and most
                    beautiful of the sisters, was seduced by Zeus and gave birth to Hermes; she later
                    became foster-mother to Arcas, son of Zeus and Callisto. Zeus also seduced two
                    others of the Pleiades: Electra, who gave birth to Dardanus, the founder of
                    Troy; and Taygeta, who gave birth to Lacedaemon, founder of Sparta. Asterope
                    was ravished by Ares and became mother of Oenomaus, king of Pisa, near
                    Olympia, who features in the legend of Auriga. Hence six Pleiades became
                    paramours of the gods. Only Merope married a mortal, Sisyphus, a notorious
                    trickster who was subsequently condemned to roll a stone eternally up a hill.
                    Although the Pleiades are popularly termed the Seven Sisters, only six stars
                    are easily visible to the naked eye, and a considerable mythology has grown up
                    to account for the ‘missing’ Pleiad. Eratosthenes says that Merope was the faint
                    Pleiad because she was the only one who married a mortal. Hyginus and Ovid
                    also recount this story, giving her shame as the reason for her faintness, but both
                    add another candidate: Electra, who could not bear to see the fall of Troy, which
                    had been founded by her son Dardanus. Hyginus says that, moved by grief,
                    she left the Pleiades altogether, but Ovid says that she merely covered her eyes
                    with her hand. Astronomers, however, have not followed either legend in their
                    naming of the stars, for the faintest named Pleiad is actually Asterope.
                    Binoculars show dozens of stars in the Pleiades, and in all the cluster contains
                    a hundred or so members. The Pleiades lie about 440 light years away, nearly
                    three times the distance of the Hyades. They are relatively youthful by stellar
                    standards, the youngest being no more than a few million years old.
                    A famous myth links the Pleiades with Orion. As Hyginus tells it, Pleione and
                    her daughters were one day walking through Boeotia when Orion tried to ravish
                    her. Pleione and the girls escaped, but Orion pursued them for seven years. Zeus
                    immortalized the chase by placing the Pleiades in the heavens where Orion
                    follows them endlessly.
                    The eye, the horns – and a nebula named the Crab
                    The bull’s glinting red eye is marked by the brightest star in Taurus, Aldebaran,
                    a name that comes from the Arabic al-dabarān meaning ‘the follower’; according
                    to the 10th-century Arabic astronomer al-Ṣūfī, this name arose because it
                    follows the Pleiades across the sky. Surprisingly for such a prominent star, Greek
                    astronomers had no name for it (although Ptolemy called it Torch in his
                    Tetrabiblos, a book about astrology). Aldebaran appears to be a member of the
                    Hyades but in fact is a foreground object at less than half the distance, and so
                    is superimposed on the cluster by chance. It is a red giant star about 40 times
                    the diameter of the Sun. Aldebaran marks the right eye of the bull; the left eye
                    is represented by Epsilon Tauri, with Gamma Tauri on the nose. At the tip of the bull’s left horn is Beta Tauri, or Elnath, a name that comes
                    from the Arabic meaning ‘the butting one’. Ptolemy described this star as
                    being common with the right foot of Auriga, the charioteer, but since the introduction of rigorously defined constellation boundaries in 1930 it is now the
                    exclusive property of Taurus. Hence the bull has kept the tip of his horn, but
                    the charioteer has lost his right foot.
                    Near the tip of the bull’s right horn, which is marked by Zeta Tauri, lies the
                    remarkable Crab Nebula, the result of one of the most celebrated events in the
                    history of astronomy – a stellar explosion, seen from Earth in AD 1054, that was
                    bright enough to be visible in daylight for three weeks. We now know this this
                    event was a supernova, the violent death of a massive star, and the Crab Nebula
                    is the shattered remnant of the star that blew up, now visible only through tele -
                    scopes. The Irish astronomer Lord Rosse (1800–67) gave the nebula its name
                    in 1848 because he thought its shape resembled a crab. (Ridpath, 163-7)

The head and fore shoulders only of Taurus are repre-
sented on the celestial maps. There are many remarkable stars in this con-
stellation, which enable the observer to find it very easily. Aldebaran is a 
bright star of the first magnitude, in the right eye of Taurus; hence it is called 
the Bull's eye: it shines with a reddish light. A line drawn from the Pole 
star, between Auriga and Perseus, will point it out. It may also be found by 
drawing a line from Epsilon in the foot of Cassiopeia, through Alpha in Per-
seus. On examination it will be remarked, that Aldebaran forms the extre-
mity of a figure like the letter V, made by Theta, Nu, Delta and Epsilon. 
This cluster in the head of Taurus is called the Hyades. The beautiful little 
group called the Pleiades, is about midway between the Hyades and the Tri-
angles, a little to the north of a line drawn from Aldebaran to Alpha Arietis. 
Each of the stars which compose the Pleiades has a particular name, though 
they are all less than the fourth magnitude, except one of the third: this 
star, owing to its superior brightness, is called Lucida Pleiadum. This cluster 
of Taurus, which is now found on his fore shoulder, was by the ancients 
placed in the brush of the tail. Beta and Zeta, in the tips of the horns, form 
with Aldebaran very nearly a right-angled triangle. Beta in the northern 
horn, is also in the foot of Auriga, as we have already mentioned. Zeta in the 
southern horn, is a little to the south of Beta. Both these stars are on the 
edge of the Milky Way, and the ecliptic passes just hetween them.
Taurus is bounded by Auriga, Perseus, Musca, Aries, Cetus, Harpa Geor-
gii, Eridanus, and Orion.
Taurus is the second sign of the zodiac, and is represented by the follow-
ing character, tf; which bears some likeness to the face and horns of a bull. 
History.--The Greeks have fabled that this sign commemorates the ani-
mal which bore Europa safely across the sea to Crete. It is probable that it 
had a place in the zodiac before the Greeks gave any attention to the stars. 
In eastern idolatry we know that the bull was one of their principal deities. 
The Egyptians worshipped Apis, and the Persians, Mithras, under the form of 
this animal; but whether the reverence which mankind entertained for it, was 
the cause of its being placed among the stars, we cannot discover. Belzoni 
found in one of the sepulchres near Thebes an embalmed bull. This symbol 
may have had reference to the Egyptian idol Osiris, or to some astrological su-
perstition connected with the sign Taurus.
The Hyades and the Pleiades are sometimes considered as separate con-
stellations, but they form a part of Taurus. The five stars in the Hyades are 
thought by some to represent the five daughters of Atlas, king of Mauritania. 
Their names were Phaola, Ambrosia, Eudora, Colonis and Polyxo: they all 
died through grief for the loss of their brother Hyas, and became these stars. 
The ancients supposed that the rising and setting of the Hyades was always 
attended with much rain. The Pleiades, in Grecian fable, are seven daughters 
of Atlas, and sisters to the Hyades; their names were Alcyone, Merope, Maia, 
Electra, Tayeta, Sterope, and Celene. After death, they were all placed in the 
heavens. Merope was the only sister who married a mortal, and it is on this 
account that her star is fainter than the rest. The Pleiades, on some ancient 
maps, are represented by a hen and chickens. The rising of this little group 
in the land of Uz during the spring season, is thus beautifully noticed in the 
thirty-eighth chapter of Job. "Canst thou bind the sweet influences of the 
Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his 
season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?"
In the Hebrew zodiac, Taurus is thought to refer to Joseph. (Green, 66-8)</note>

                <note xml:id="NORMAGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Norma is one of the constellations introduced by the French astronomer Nicolas
                    Louis de Lacaille following his mapping of the southern skies in 1751–52. It
                    consists of faint stars between Ara and Lupus that were not catalogued by
                    Ptolemy. On his 1756 planisphere Lacaille called it l’Equerre et la Regle, the
                    square and rule, depicting it as a draughtsman’s set-square and ruler.
                    Lacaille placed it next to another of his inventions, the compasses (which he
                    called le Compas, now known as Circinus), and the southern triangle (Triangulum Australe); this latter figure was an earlier invention of the Dutch navigators
                    Keyser and de Houtman which Lacaille visualized as a builder’s level, thereby
                    creating a trio of surveying and building instruments. On the 1763 edition of
                    the planisphere Lacaille Latinized and shortened the name of the constellation
                    to Norma; others, though, preferred the fuller name Norma et Regula, as did
                    Johann Bode on his atlas of 1801 (see illustration on the following page). The
                    brightest stars of Norma are of only fourth magnitude and none have names.
                    In his widely quoted book Star Names, Their Lore and Meaning the historian
                    R.H. Allen called this constellation ‘the Level and Square’. Allen said that the
                    French edition of Flamsteed’s star atlas (i.e. the Atlas Céleste of Jean Fortin)
                    showed it as Niveau, the level, but he is wrong – the alternative name ‘level’ was actually applied to the southern triangle, Triangulum Australe. Allen seemingly
                    misread the French map and transferred the name to the wrong constellation,
                    in a reprise of the way in which star names were misapplied through misreadings of maps down the ages. Allen’s error has caused confusion ever since.
                    Because of changes in the constellation’s boundaries since Lacaille’s time,
                    Norma no longer has stars labelled Alpha or Beta. The stars that Lacaille
                    designated Alpha and Beta Normae are now part of Scorpius, where they are
                    known as N and H Scorpii respectively (Ridpath, 127-8)

Norma Regula is between Ara and Lupus. It contains twelve stars, all 
smaller than the fourth magnitude. Sometimes this modern group is called 
Euclid's Square. (Green, 86)</note>

                <note xml:id="LEOMINORGLOSS" resp="#DCH">A lion cub accompanying Leo, introduced by the Polish astronomer Johannes
                    Hevelius in his star catalogue and atlas of 1687. He formed it from 18 faint stars
                    between Ursa Major and Leo where the short-lived constellation Jordanus once
                    flowed (page 195). The brightest stars of Leo Minor are of only fourth magnitude and there are no legends associated with it.
                    Curiously, Leo Minor has no star labelled Alpha, although there is a Beta
                    Leonis Minoris. This seems to have resulted from an oversight on the part of
                    the 19th- century English astronomer Francis Baily. Hevelius did not label the
                    stars in any of his newly formed constellations, so 150 years later Baily did it for
                    him. In his British Association Catalogue of 1845, Baily assigned the letter Beta to
                    the second-brightest star in Leo Minor, but left the brightest star (46 Leonis
                    Minoris, on the rump of the lion) unlettered by mistake.
                    There is further confusion regarding the naming of the brightest star in this
                    constellation. In his book Star Names, Their Lore and Meaning, R.H. Allen says that
                    Hevelius described the brightest star in Leo Minor as Praecipua, meaning ‘chief ’, and that it was later used as a star name by the Italian astronomer
                    Giuseppe Piazzi in his Palermo Catalogue of 1814. However, I am unable to find
                    any such mention of a Praecipua in Hevelius’s catalogue, although the name
                    does appear in Piazzi’s catalogue. Allen also states that the star named Praecipua
                    by Piazzi was 46 LMi, but again he is wrong; Piazzi’s Praecipua was actually
                    37 LMi, which he wrongly assessed as being brighter than 46 LMi. Reasonably
                    enough, modern sources have followed Allen by using the name Praecipua for
                    the brightest star, 46 LMi, rather than the fainter 37 LMi. (Ridpath, 114-5)

Leo Minor is immediately to the southward of the hind 
paws of Ursa Major. The position of the principal stars in the group may be 
easily ascertained from the quadrilateral figure which they form in the middle 
of the body, as represented on our plate. An imaginary line drawn from 
Gamma or Phachd in the square of Ursa Major, through Psi of that constella-
tion, and produced to the same distance beyond it, will point out this figure. 
The stars which compose it are all of the fourth magnitude, except the one 
marked with the letter I, which is of the third. Some stars of the fifth magni-
tude, which are not on the map, may, under favourable circumstances, be seen 
in the tail, and near the head and fore feet: three in this last situation are ar-
ranged in an equilateral triangle: there are also three in the tail, of the same 
brightness, placed nearly in a straight line. Two nebulae are found in this 
group.
Leo Minor is bounded by Ursa Major, Lynx, Cancer, Leo Major, and 
Coma Berenices.
History.--Some have supposed that this asterism owes its place in the 
heavens to the fable of Hercules killing the Nemsean lion. In the Egyptian 
calendar we find that Leo Major, which is contiguous to this and often em-
braces some of its stars, is composed of two Lions and the head of a third. 
Leo Minor is, however, a modern constellation, and was formed out of the 
stellae informes, or unformed stars, of the ancients. In the oldest planispheres 
we find a species of serpent occupying the place of Leo Minor. (Green, 30)</note>

                <note xml:id="MUSCABOREALISGLOSS" resp="#DCH"><!--There is no information on Musca Borealis in Green.-->This abandoned constellation, which lay in the northern part of present-day
                    Aries, has a confusing history. It was introduced on a globe of 1612 by the
                    Dutchman Petrus Plancius under the name Apes, the Bee. He created it from four of Ptolemy’s unformed stars which were described in the Almagest as lying
                    ‘over the rump’ of Aries. Johannes Hevelius changed the type of insect when
                    he renamed it Musca, the fly, on his Firmamentum Sobiescianum atlas of 1687.
                    This was confusing, since there already was a Musca in the southern hemisphere, created almost a century earlier from the observations of Keyser and de
                    Houtman. Johann Bode showed Musca on his Uranographia atlas, but within the
                    borders of Aries (see illustration above). The constellation later became known
                    as Musca Borealis, the northern fly, to distinguish it from its southern namesake.
                    This longer name seems to have first appeared on Alexander Jamieson’s Celestial
                    Atlas of 1822. Eventually, the northern fly was swatted by astronomers, although
                    the southern Musca remains.
                    To add to the confusion, the same stars were used by the Frenchman IgnaceGaston Pardies (1636–73) to form Lilium, the fleur-de-lis of France. Lilium
                    appeared in a star atlas by Pardies entitled Globi coelestis in tabulas planas redacti
                    descriptio that was published in 1674, the year after his death, but was a very
                    short-lived addition to the sky. (Ridpath, 198-9)</note>

                <note xml:id="PERSEUSGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Perseus (Περσεύς in Greek) is one of the most famous Greek heroes. The characters of the story in which he is the action-man hero are represented by six
                    constellations that occupy a substantial part of the sky. The constellation depicting Perseus himself lies in a prominent part of the Milky Way, which is perhaps
                    why Aratus termed him ‘dust-stained’.
                    In Greek myth, Perseus was the son of Danaë, daughter of King Acrisius of
                    Argos. Acrisius had locked Danaë away in a heavily guarded dungeon when an
                    oracle foretold that he would be killed by his grandson. But Zeus visited Danaë
                    in the form of a shower of golden rain that fell through the skylight of the
                    dungeon into her lap and impregnated her. When Acrisius found out, he locked
                    Danaë and the infant Perseus into a wooden chest and cast them out to sea.
                    Inside the bobbing chest Danaë clutched her child and prayed to Zeus for
                    deliverance from the sea. A few days later, the chest washed ashore on the island
                    of Seriphos, its cargo still alive but starved and thirsty. A fisherman, Dictys,
                    broke the chest open and found the mother and child. Dictys brought up
                    Perseus as his own son.
                    The brother of Dictys was King Polydectes, who coveted Danaë as a wife.
                    But Danaë was reluctant and Perseus, now grown to manhood, defended her
                    from the king’s advances. Instead, King Polydectes hatched a plan to get rid of
                    Perseus. The king pretended he had turned his attentions to Hippodameia,
                    daughter of King Oenomaus of Elis. King Polydectes asked his subjects, including Perseus, to provide horses for a wedding present. Perseus had no horse to
                    give, nor money to buy one, so Polydectes sent him to bring the head of Medusa
                    the Gorgon. Perseus and Medusa the Gorgon
                    The Gorgons were three hideously ugly sisters called Euryale, Stheno, and
                    Medusa. They were the daughters of Phorcys, a god of the sea, and his sister
                    Ceto. The Gorgons had faces covered with dragon scales, tusks like boars, hands
                    of brass, and wings of gold. Their evil gaze turned to stone anyone who set eyes
                    on them. Euryale and Stheno were immortal, but Medusa was mortal. She was
                    distinguishable from the others because she had snakes for hair. In her youth
                    Medusa had been famed for her beauty, particularly that of her hair, but she
                    was condemned to a life of ugliness by Athene in whose temple she had been
                    ravished by Poseidon.
                    A Gorgon’s head would be a powerful weapon for a tyrannical king to
                    enforce his rule, but King Polydectes probably thought that Perseus would die
                    in his attempt to obtain it. However, the king had reckoned without Perseus’s
                    family connections among the gods. Athene gave him a bronze shield which he
                    carried on his left arm, while in his right hand he wielded a sword of diamond
                    made by Hephaestus. Hermes gave him winged sandals, and on his head he
                    wore a helmet of darkness from Hades that made him invisible. Perseus beheads Medusa
                    Under the guidance of Athene, Perseus flew to the slopes of Mount Atlas where
                    the sisters of the Gorgons, called the Graeae, acted as lookouts. The Graeae
                    were poorly qualified for the task, since they had only one eye between the three
                    of them, which they passed to each other in turn. Perseus snatched the eye from
                    them and threw it into Lake Tritonis.
                    He then followed a trail of statues of men and animals who had been turned
                    to stone by the gaze of the Gorgons. Unseen in his helmet of invisibility, Perseus
                    crept up on the Gorgons and waited until night when Medusa and her snakes
                    were asleep. Looking only at her reflection in his brightly polished shield,
                    Perseus swung his diamond sword and decapitated Medusa with one blow. As
                    Medusa’s head rolled to the ground, Perseus was startled to see the winged horse
                    Pegasus and the armed warrior Chrysaor spring fully grown from her body, the
                    legacy of her youthful affair with Poseidon. (Pegasus is commemorated in a
                    constellation of its own.) Perseus rapidly collected up Medusa’s head, put it in
                    a pouch and flew away before the other Gorgons awoke.
                    Drops of blood fell from the head and turned into serpents as they struck the
                    sands of Libya below. Strong winds blew Perseus across the sky like a raincloud,
                    so he stopped to rest in the kingdom of Atlas. When Atlas refused him hospitality, Perseus took out the Gorgon’s head and turned him into the range of
                    mountains that now bear his name.
                    Perseus rescues Andromeda
                    The following morning Perseus resumed his flight with new vigour, coming to
                    the land of King Cepheus whose daughter Andromeda was being sacrificed to
                    a sea monster. Perseus’s rescue of the girl, one of the most famous themes of
                    mythology, is told in detail under the entry for Andromeda (page 37). Perseus
                    returned triumphantly with Andromeda to the island of Seriphos, where he
                    found his mother and Dictys sheltering in a temple from the tyranny of King
                    Polydectes. Perseus stormed into the King’s palace to a hostile reception. Reaching into his pouch, Perseus brought out the head of Medusa, turning Polydectes
                    and his followers to stone. Perseus appointed his stepfather Dictys as king of
                    Seriphos. Athene took the head of Medusa and set it in the middle of her shield.
                    Incidentally, the prophecy that had started all these adventures – namely, that
                    Acrisius would be killed by his grandson – eventually came to pass during an
                    athletics contest when a discus thrown by Perseus accidentally hit Acrisius, one
                    of the spectators, and killed him. Perseus and Andromeda had many children,
                    including Perses, whom they gave to Cepheus to bring up. From Perses, the
                    kings of Persia were said to have been descended.
                    Algol the Demon and other stars in Perseus
                    In the sky, Perseus lies next to his beloved Andromeda. Nearby are her parents
                    Cepheus and Cassiopeia, as well as the monster, Cetus, to which she was sacrificed. Pegasus the winged horse completes the tableau. Perseus himself is shown
                    grasping the Gorgon’s head by the hair with his left hand. In his right, he holds
                    aloft his star-whetted sword, sometimes depicted as a curving scimitar. Ptolemy described four stars as lying in the Gorgon’s head; we know them as
                    Beta, Omega, Rho, and Pi Persei. Several map-makers in the 17th, 18th, and
                    19th centuries made these and surrounding stars into a sub-constellation, Caput
                    Medusae, the head of Medusa. Bode gave it a separate label on his Uranographia
                    atlas (see illustration on page 141).
                    The star that Ptolemy called ‘the bright one in the Gorgon head’ is Beta
                    Persei, named Algol from the Arabic ra’s al-ghul meaning ‘the demon’s head’.
                    Algol is the type of star known as an eclipsing binary, consisting of two close
                    stars that orbit each other, in this case every 2.9 days. Algol varies in brightness
                    as the two stars eclipse each other. Its variability was discovered in 1669 by the
                    Italian astronomer Geminiano Montanari (1633–87).
                    It is sometimes speculated that the name Algol arose because the Arabs knew
                    of its variability, but in fact the name has its origins in Greek mythology and its
                    variability is simply coincidence. The Arabic astronomer al-Ṣūfī, who paid more
                    attention to star brightnesses than had Ptolemy, made no mention of any
                    variability in his Book of the Fixed Stars published in AD 964. The sketch of the
                    constellation in his book places Algol next to Medusa’s eye, not actually on it;
                    many later cartographers, including Flamsteed and Bode, positioned the star
                    even higher on the forehead. The idea of Algol being a ‘winking eye’ seems to
                    be a modern myth.
                    The brightest star in the constellation, second-magnitude Alpha Persei, is
                    officially named Mirfak, which comes from the Arabic for ‘elbow’. A former
                    alternative name was Algenib from the Arabic meaning ‘the side’, which is
                    where Ptolemy described it as lying; however, this name is now officially assigned
                    to Gamma Pegasi. The right hand of Perseus, in which he holds his sword, is
                    marked by a feature that Ptolemy in the Almagest termed a ‘nebulous mass’ – in
                    fact, a twin cluster of stars now known as the Double Cluster. (Ridpath, 140-3)

The stars which compose this constellation are nearly all 
in the Milky Way. Algenib, a star of the second magnitude in the body of 
Perseus, is almost surrounded by small stars, and from this circumstance may 
soon be found. A line drawn from Beta in Auriga, through Capella, and pro-
duced to once and a half their distance, will terminate at a star in Perseus of 
the third magnitude, marked Delta. Algenib is the brightest star near this. 
On the side of Algenib, opposite to Delta and at about the same distance from 
it, is Gamma in the shoulder; the three forming a line slightly curved. By 
continuing the line a little farther, we meet with Eta near the head. Theta, in 
the southern shoulder, forms an equilateral triangle with Algenib and Gamma. 
The head of Medusa, which Perseus holds in his hand, may be known by a 
bright star, Beta, of the second magnitude, named Algol, and three stars, Pi, 
Zeta, and p, of the fourth magnitude, near it, in the form of a small triangle. 
Epsilon, in the southern knee, forms an isosceles triangle with Algol and 
Delta. Zeta, in the foot, with Kpsilon, Delta, Algenib, Gamma and Eta. form 
a curved line, which nearly divides the constellation into two equal parts. 
Zeta, Epsilon, lota and Algol, form the lour angles of a very perfect rhombus. 
Other combinations may lie formed on the plate, which will enable the ob-
server to find them in the heavens.
In the northern hand there is a group of many minute stars. Near Al-
genib the Milky Way is remarkably luminous; indeed it is more vivid round 
the whole of Perseus than in other places. The most noticeable phenomenon 
in this constellation is the variable brightness of the star Algol in Medusa's 
head; it changes constantly and regularly from the lustre of a star of the se-
cond magnitude to that of the fourth. The time taken up in passing from its 
greatest to its smallest magnitude is sixty-nine hours, or nearly three days. 
During four hours it gradually diminishes in lustre; in the succeeding four 
hours it regularly recovers its first magnitude; and then during the remainder 
of the period it invariably preserves its greatest brilliancy. After the expiration 
of this term, its decrease again commences, and the other changes follow. 
This discovery was made in 1783 by John Goodricke of York (Eng.). There 
are seven or eight nebulae in this group.
Perseus is bounded by Camelopardalis, Cassiopeia, Andromeda, Triangu-
lum Majus. Musca, Taurus, and Auriga.
History.--According to Grecian fable, Perseus is the son of Danase. His 
grandfather, Acrisius, being informed by the Oracle that he should be killed by 
bis grandchild, caused Perseus, as soon as he was born, to be thrown into the 
sea. The infant was, however, saved from drowning by some fishermen, and 
lived to verify the saying of the Oracle. Perseus is represented on the celestial 
maps with a sword in his right hand and the head of Medusa in his left. When 
he determined to vanquish the Gorgons, Pluto lent him his helmet, which had 
the power of rendering the bearer invisible. Minerva furnished him with a 
buckler resplendent as glass, and he received from Mercuiy wings and a 
sword. Thus equipped, he set out on his expedition, and succeeded in cutting 
off the head of Medusa, one of the Gorgons, while she was sleeping, and bore 
it away in triumph. Accordine to the fable, the blood which dropped from 
this head in its passage through the air, produced an innumerable quantity of 
serpents, which ever since have infested the sands of the Lybian desert, on 
which it fell. Alter some other exploits, Perseus rescued Andromeda from a 
cruel death, and being captivated with her beauty, made her his wife--the par-
ticulars of which story we shall presently narrate. When he restored the ar-
mour which had been kindly lent to him by his friends, he placed the Gorgon's 
head on the aegis of Minerva, where it still remains. Jupiter, on the death of 
Perseus, placed him in the skies.
The Gorgons were three sisters, inhabitants of Lybia, who had the power 
of turning into stone all those on whom they fixed their eyes. Medusa was 
the only one of the sisters liable to death. She was celebrated for the beauty 
and luxuriance of her hair, but having offended Minerva, that goddess changed 
her locks into hideous serpents. Some time after this event Medusa was killed 
in the manner we have just stated. (Green, 35-7)</note>

                <note xml:id="PEGASUSGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Pegasus was the winged horse best known for his association with the Greek
                    hero Bellerophon. The manner of the horse’s birth was unusual, to say the least.
                    Its mother was Medusa, the Gorgon, who in her youth was famed for her
                    beauty, particularly her flowing hair. Many suitors approached her, but the one
                    who took her virginity was Poseidon, who is both god of the sea and of horses.
                    Unfortunately, the seduction happened in the temple of Athene. Outraged by
                    having her temple defiled, the goddess Athene changed Medusa into a snakehaired monster whose gaze could turn men to stone.
                    When Perseus decapitated Medusa, both Pegasus and the warrior Chrysaor
                    sprang from her body. The name Pegasus comes from the Greek word πηγαί
                    (pegai), meaning ‘springs’ or ‘waters’. Chrysaor’s name means ‘golden sword’,
                    in description of the blade he carried when he was born. Chrysaor played no
                    further part in the story of Pegasus; he later became father of Geryon, the threebodied monster whom Heracles slew.
                    Pegasus stretched his wings and flew away from the body of his mother,
                    eventually arriving at Mount Helicon in Boeotia, home of the Muses. There,
                    he struck the ground with his hoof and, to the delight of the Muses, from the
                    rock gushed a spring of water which was named Hippocrene, ‘horse’s fountain’.
                    The goddess Athene later came to see it.
                    Pegasus and Bellerophon
                    Pegasus is sometimes depicted as the steed of Perseus, but this is wrong. Pegasus
                    was, in fact, ridden by another hero, Bellerophon, son of Glaucus. King Iobates
                    of Lycia sent Bellerophon on a mission to kill the Chimaera, a fire-breathing
                    monster that was devastating Lycia. According to Hesiod the Chimaera was the
                    offspring of Typhon and Echidne, and had three heads, one like a lion, another
                    like a goat and the third like a dragon. But Homer said in the Iliad that it had
                    the front of a lion, the tail of a snake and a middle like a goat, the description
                    that most other authors have followed.
                    Bellerophon found Pegasus drinking at the spring of Peirene in Corinth and
                    tamed him with a golden bridle given by Athene. Ascending into the sky on the
                    divine horse, Bellerophon swooped down on the Chimaera, killing it with
                    arrows and a lance. After undertaking various other tasks for King Iobates,
                    Bellerophon seems to have got over-inflated ideas, for he attempted to fly up
                    on Pegasus to join the gods on Olympus. Before he got there he fell back to
                    Earth; but Pegasus completed the trip and Zeus used him for a while to carry his thunder and lightning, according to Hesiod. Zeus later put Pegasus among
                    the constellations.
                    Eratosthenes doubted this story because, he said, the horse in the sky has no
                    wings. It is true that Aratus did not mention wings on the celestial horse, but he
                    identified the constellation as Pegasus, and Ptolemy in his Almagest definitely
                    mentioned wings, so Eratosthenes was mistaken. Germanicus Caesar was in
                    no doubt. Pegasus, he wrote, ‘beats his swift wings in the topmost circle of the
                    sky and rejoices in his stellification’. Eratosthenes repeated the claim of the 5th
                    century BC playwright Euripides that this constellation represents Melanippe,
                    daughter of Chiron the centaur (see Equuleus, page 93).
                    Pegasus in the sky
                    The Greeks from Aratus to Ptolemy knew the constellation simply as Ἵππος
                    (Hippos), the horse; the horse was usually understood to be Pegasus, but only
                    later did it become commonly known by that specific name. In the sky, only the
                    top half of the horse is shown – even so, it is still the seventh-largest constellation. Its body is represented by the famous Square of Pegasus whose corners
                    are marked by four stars. In Greek times, one star was considered common with Andromeda, marking both the horse’s navel and the top of Andromeda’s head.
                    When Johann Bayer came to assign Greek letters to the stars early in the 17th
                    century he gave this a dual identity as both Alpha Andromedae and Delta
                    Pegasi. Now it is allocated exclusively to Andromeda, as Alpha Andromedae;
                    there is no longer a Delta Pegasi. Hence, strictly speaking, the Square of Pegasus
                    now has only three corners.
                    The remaining three stars of the Square are: Alpha Pegasi, also known as
                    Markab from the Arabic for ‘shoulder’; Beta Pegasi, called Scheat from the
                    Arabic meaning ‘the shin’; and Gamma Pegasi, or Algenib, meaning ‘the side’
                    in Arabic. A star on the horse’s muzzle, Epsilon Pegasi, is called Enif from the
                    Arabic meaning ‘nose’. Germanicus Caesar said it lies ‘where the animal chews
                    the bit, his mouth foaming’. (Ridpath, 138-40)

This constellation is in an inverted position, and occupies 
a large space in the heavens between the Eagle, the Dolphin, and Andromeda. 
We see but a part of Pegasus in the sky, the rest of the animal being hid by the 
clouds, as the Poets imagine. It can very readily be found by means of its 
four principal stars, which form a large and regular four-sided figure: they are 
all of the second magnitude. The star in the square, which is most northerly, is 
in the head of Andromeda, and is common to both these constellations, as was 
before mentioned: the three other stars are named Algenib, Markab, and 
Scheat. A line drawn from Wega in Lyra, through Gamma in the centre of 
the Cross formed by the stars in Cygnus, will, if produced, point out Scheat 
or Beta in the leg of Pegasus. About thirteen degrees directly south of Scheat, 
is Markab or Alpha in the wing of the horse. A line drawn from the bright 
star in Aquila, through Epsilon, the most southern one in the Dolphin, will 
make it known. A line drawn from Deneb in Cygnus, by Scheat, conducts us 
to Algenib or Gamma. A line drawn from Sagitta, through the head of the 
Dolphin, will pass Epsilon in the nose, and if produced a little farther will 
point out Theta in the head. Epsilon is sometimes called Enif: it is a star of 
the third magnitude. A line drawn from Theta to Markab, will pass by Zeta 
in the neck. Eta in the northern leg, is found by a line from Scheat to Gamma, 
in the centre of the cross of Cygnus: Iota and Kappa, in the other foot, by a 
line from Scheat to the Arrow: Lambda and Mu, on the breast, are directly 
south of Eta, on a line drawn from that star to Markab.
Pegasus is bounded by Andromeda, Honores Frederici, Lacerta, Cygnus, 
Vulpecula et Anser, Delphinus, Equuleus, Aquarius, and Pisces.
History.--This constellation represents the flying horse, which sprung 
from the blood of Medusa, after she was slain by Perseus. As soon as born, 
Pegasus flew to Mount Helicon, and there fixed his residence. Here, striking 
the earth with his hoof, he opened the sacred fountain, called from that circum-
stance Hippocrene. He became the favourite of the Muses, who resided on this 
spot, and being tamed either by Neptune or Minerva, he was given to Bellero-
phon to conquer the Chimsera. This monster being destroyed, Bellerophon 
attempted to fly to the abode of Jupiter; but Pegasus dismounted his rider, and 
continuing his flight to heaven, was placed here among the constellations. (Green, 59-60)</note>

                <note xml:id="CHAMAELEONGLOSS" resp="#DCH"><!--There is no information on Chamaeleon in Green.-->The celestial chameleon, named after the lizard that can change its skin colour
                    to match its mood, is one of the constellations representing exotic animals
                    introduced by the Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de
                    Houtman when they charted the southern skies in 1595–97. These new
                    southern constellations were first shown on a globe by their fellow Dutchman
                    Petrus Plancius in 1598 and were rapidly adopted by other map makers such as Johann Bayer, for no other observations of the far southern skies were then
                    available. Chameleons are particularly common in Madagascar, where the
                    Dutch fleet stopped to rest and resupply in 1595 on its way to the East Indies,
                    so they probably saw plenty of them there.
                    Chamaeleon lies near the south celestial pole, next to Musca, the fly. On a
                    globe of 1600 the Dutch cartographer Jodocus Hondius (1563–1612) depicted
                    the chameleon sticking out its tongue to catch the fly. Three years later, Johann
                    Bayer in his Uranometria showed the chameleon in the same pose yet evidently
                    failed to appreciate what the adjacent insect, then still unnamed, was supposed
                    to be – he depicted it not as a fly but a bee and named it Apis, as did Bode
                    nearly 200 years later. Chamaeleon has no legends associated with it, and it
                    contains no bright stars. (Ridpath, 75-6)</note>

                <note xml:id="ANDROMEDAGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Perhaps the most enduring of all Greek myths is the story of Perseus and
                    Andromeda, the original version of George and the dragon. Its heroine is the
                    beautiful princess Andromeda (Ἀνδρομέδα in Greek). She was the daughter of
                    the weak King Cepheus of Ethiopia and the vain Queen Cassiopeia, whose
                    boastfulness knew no bounds.
                    Andromeda’s misfortunes began one day when her mother claimed that she
                    was more beautiful even than the Nereids, a particularly alluring group of sea
                    nymphs. The affronted Nereids decided that Cassiopeia’s vanity had finally gone
                    too far and they asked Poseidon, the sea god, to teach her a lesson. In retribution, Poseidon sent a terrible monster (some say also a flood) to ravage the coast
                    of King Cepheus’s territory. Dismayed at the destruction, and with his subjects
                    clamouring for action, the beleaguered Cepheus appealed to the Oracle of
                    Ammon for a solution. He was told that he must sacrifice his virgin daughter to
                    appease the monster.
                    Hence the blameless Andromeda came to be chained to a rock to atone for
                    the sins of her mother, who watched from the shore with bitter remorse. The site of this event is said to have been on the Mediterranean coast at Joppa (Jaffa),
                    the modern Tel-Aviv. As Andromeda stood on the wave-lashed cliffs, pale with
                    terror and weeping pitifully at her impending fate, the hero Perseus happened
                    by, fresh from his exploit of beheading Medusa the Gorgon. His heart was
                    captivated by the sight of the frail beauty in distress below.
                    The Roman poet Ovid tells us in his book the Metamorphoses that Perseus at
                    first almost mistook her for a marble statue. Only the wind ruffling her hair and
                    the warm tears on her cheeks showed that she was human. Perseus asked her
                    name and why she was chained there. Shy Andromeda, totally different in
                    character from her vainglorious mother, did not at first reply; even though
                    awaiting a horrible death in the monster’s slavering jaws, she would have hidden
                    her face modestly in her hands, had they not been bound to the rock.
                    Perseus persisted in his questioning. Eventually, afraid that her silence might
                    be misinterpreted as guilt, she told Perseus her story, but broke off with a scream
                    as she saw the monster breasting through the waves towards her. Pausing politely
                    to ask the permission of her parents for Andromeda’s hand in marriage, Perseus
                    swooped down, slew the sea-dragon with his diamond sword, released the
                    swooning girl to the enthusiastic applause of the onlookers, and claimed her for his bride. Andromeda later bore Perseus six children including Perses, ancestor
                    of the Persians, and Gorgophonte, father of Tyndareus, king of Sparta.
                    The mythologists said that the Greek goddess Athene placed Andromeda’s
                    image among the stars, where she lies between Perseus and her mother
                    Cassiopeia. Only the constellation Pisces, the fishes, separates her from the sea
                    monster, Cetus.
                    Stars in Andromeda – and a spiral galaxy
                    Star maps picture Andromeda with her hands in chains. Her head is marked by
                    the second-magnitude star Alpha Andromedae, originally shared with neighbouring Pegasus. Echoes of its former dual identity live on in its popular name
                    of Alpheratz, which comes from the Arabic al-faras, meaning ‘the horse’. Her
                    waist is marked by the star Beta Andromedae, called Mirach, a name corrupted
                    from the Arabic al-mi’zar meaning ‘the girdle’ or ‘loin cloth’. Her left foot is
                    marked by Gamma Andromedae, whose official IAU-approved name is
                    Almach, but which in the past has also been variously spelled Almaak, Alamak,
                    or Almak, from the Arabic al-’anaq, referring to the desert lynx or caracal which
                    the old Arabs visualized here. Through small telescopes this is a beautiful twin
                    star of contrasting yellow and blue colours.
                    The most celebrated object in the constellation is the great spiral galaxy M31,
                    positioned on Andromeda’s right hip, where it is visible as an elongated blur to
                    the naked eye on clear nights. M31 is a whirlpool of stars similar to our own
                    Milky Way. At a distance of 2.5 million light years, the Andromeda Galaxy is
                    the farthest object visible to the naked eye. Discovery of this object is attributed
                    to the Arabic astronomer al-Ṣūfī (903–986), or Azophi in Latinized form, who
                    first mentioned it in his Book of the Fixed Stars (c. AD 964). (Ridpath, 37-9)

his group is immediately south of Cassiopeia, and con-
tains about twenty-seven stars, visible to the naked eye; the three principal 
of which are of the second magnitude, and nearly in a straight line running 
east and west. Alpha is in the head, and forms a great square with the three 
principal stars in Pegasus, the contiguous group. Beta, in the girdle, is also 
called Merach or Mizar. The star in the south foot is Gamma, which is also 
named Almaach. By means of these three stars this constellation may readily 
be found. We will, however, be a little more particular. A line drawn from 
the Pole star through Beta in the chair of Cassiopeia, and prolonged an equal 
distance towards the south, will show Merach. Another line from the Pole 
star through Epsilon in Cassiopeia, will give Almaach. Psi, a star of the fourth 
magnitude, in the other foot, is found about half way between this last and 
Delta of Cassiopeia. Nearly midway between Alpha and Gamma of Andro-
meda, we find Beta or Merach in the girdle or waist. Between Alpha and 
Beta we readily discover, near the neck, Delta, Epsilon and Pi. South of Ep-
silon, in the arm, is Zeta and Eta. Theta, in the other arm, forms a triangle 
with Alpha and Beta. To the north, above Merach, are Mu and Nu, stars of 
the fourth magnitude. Iota, Kappa, and Lambda, stars of the same size with 
the last, are all in the northern hand, as represented on the old maps, but they 
are now reckoned among the stars in the group called Honores Frederici. By 
drawing a line from the girdle towards the north, a very remarkable nebula 
will be found near the star Nu. This is visible under favourable circumstances 
to the naked eye: it resembles two cones of light joined at their base. No 
other nebula of a similar kind can be seen without the assistance of the teles-
cope. There is another nebula south of Almaach.
Andromeda is bounded by Perseus, Cassiopeia, Honores Frederici, Pega-
sus, Piscis Borealis, and the Triangles.
The story of Andromeda, from whom this constellation de-
rives its present name, is pretty well ascertained. She was the daughter of 
Cepheus and Cassiopeia. After being promised in maniage by her father 
to her uncle, Phineus, she gave herself up to be devoured by a sea monster, 
sent by Neptune on the occasion we have just stated. She was fastened to a 
rock by chains, and at the moment the monster was about to devour her, Per-
seus, who was returning through the air from the conquest of the Gorgons, 
saw her, was captivated with her beauty, and instantly changed the sea mon-
ster into a rock, by showing him Medusa's head, which was still reeking in his 
hand. Cepheus, her father, then betrothed her to Perseus. This contem-
plated union was violently opposed by Phineus, who, after a furious battle 
with his rival, was converted into a stone by the wonder working head of the 
Gorgon. (Green, 39-40)</note>

                <note xml:id="VIRGOGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Virgo is the second-largest constellation in the sky, exceeded only by the much
                    fainter Hydra. The Greeks including Ptolemy called the constellation Παρθένος
                    (Parthenos). She is usually identified as Dike, goddess of justice, who was the
                    daughter of Zeus and Themis; but she is also known as Astraeia, daughter of
                    Astraeus (father of the stars) and Eos (goddess of the dawn). Virgo is depicted
                    with wings, reminiscent of an angel, holding an ear of wheat in her left hand
                    (the star Spica). Dike features as the impartial observer in a moral tale depicting
                    mankind’s declining standards. It was a favourite tale of Greek and Roman
                    mythologists, and its themes still sound familiar today.
                    Dike was supposed to have lived on Earth in the Golden Age of mankind,
                    when Cronus ruled Olympus. It was a time of peace and happiness, a season of perennial spring when food grew without cultivation and humans never grew
                    old. Men lived like the gods, not knowing work, sorrow, crime, or war. Dike
                    moved among them, dispensing wisdom and justice.
                    Then, when Zeus overthrew his father Cronus on Olympus, the Silver Age
                    began, inferior to the age that had just passed. In the Silver Age, Zeus shortened
                    springtime and introduced the yearly cycle of seasons. Humans in this age
                    became quarrelsome and ceased to honour the gods. Dike longed for the idyllic
                    days gone by. She assembled the human race and spoke sternly to them for
                    forsaking the ideals of their ancestors. ‘Worse is to come’, she warned them.
                    Then she spread her wings and took refuge in the mountains, turning her
                    back on mankind.
                    Finally came the Ages of Bronze and Iron, when humans descended into
                    violence, theft, and war. Unable to endure the sins of humanity any longer, Dike
                    abandoned the Earth and flew up to heaven, where she sits to this day next to
                    the constellation of Libra, which some see as the scales of justice.
                    Other identifications
                    There are other goddesses who can claim identity with Virgo. One is Demeter,
                    the corn goddess, who was daughter of Cronus and Rhea. By her brother
                    Zeus she had a daughter, Persephone (also called Kore, meaning ‘maiden’).
                    Persephone might have remained a virgin for ever had not her uncle, Hades,
                    god of the Underworld, kidnapped her while she was out picking flowers one
                    day at Henna in Sicily. Hades swept her aboard his chariot drawn by four black
                    horses and galloped with her into his underground kingdom, where she became
                    his reluctant queen.
                    Demeter, having scoured the Earth for her missing daughter without success,
                    cursed the fields of Sicily so that the crops failed. In desperation she asked the
                    Great Bear what he had seen, for he never sets, but since the abduction had
                    taken place during the day he referred her to the Sun, who finally told her the
                    unwelcome truth.
                    Demeter angrily confronted Zeus, father of Persephone, and demanded that
                    he order his brother Hades to return the girl. Zeus agreed to try; but already it
                    was too late, because Persephone had eaten some pomegranate seeds while in
                    the Underworld and, once having done that, she could never return permanently to the land of the living. A compromise was reached in which Persephone
                    would spend half (some say one-third) of the year in the Underworld with her
                    husband, and the rest of the year above ground with her mother. Clearly, this
                    is an allegory on the changing seasons.
                    Eratosthenes offers the additional suggestion that Virgo might be Atargatis,
                    the Syrian fertility goddess, who was sometimes depicted holding an ear of corn.
                    But this seems to be a mistake because Atargatis is identified with the constellation Piscis Austrinus. Hyginus, more plausibly, equates Virgo with Erigone, the
                    daughter of Icarius, who hanged herself after the death of her father. In this
                    story, Icarius became the constellation Boötes, which adjoins Virgo to the north,
                    and Icarius’s dog Maera became the star Procyon (see Boötes, page 54, and
                    Canis Minor, page 64). Eratosthenes and Hyginus both name Tyche, the goddess of fortune, as
                    another identification of Virgo; but Tyche was usually represented holding the
                    horn of plenty (cornucopia) rather than an ear of grain. In the sky, the ear of
                    corn is represented by the first-magnitude star Spica, a Latin name meaning
                    ‘ear of grain’. The name in Greek, Στάχυς (Stachys), has the same meaning.
                    Beta Virginis is called Zavijava, from an Arabic name meaning ‘the angle’;
                    in the Almagest, Ptolemy located this star on the top of Virgo’s left wing. Gamma
                    Virginis, also in the left wing, is called Porrima, after a Roman goddess. According to Ovid in his Fasti, Porrima and her sister Postverta were the sisters or
                    companions of the prophetess Carmenta. Porrima sang of events in the past,
                    while Postverta sang of what was to come.
                    Epsilon Virginis, on Virgo’s right wing, is named Vindemiatrix, from the
                    Latin meaning ‘grape-gatherer’ or ‘vintager’, because its first visible rising before
                    the Sun in August marked the beginning of each year’s vintage. Ovid in his Fasti
                    tells us that this star commemorates a boy named Ampelus (the Greek word for
                    ‘vine’) who was loved by Dionysus, god of wine. While picking grapes from a
                    vine that trailed up an elm tree, Ampelus fell from a branch and was killed;
                    Dionysus placed him among the stars.
                    This star’s original Greek name, Προτρυγητήρ (Protrygeter), also means
                    ‘grape gatherer’, the same as in Latin. Its importance as a calendar star is
                    demonstrated by the fact that it was one of the few stars named by Aratus and,
                    at third magnitude, was far fainter than the others.
                    Virgo, incidentally, contains the autumnal equinox, the point at which the
                    Sun crosses the celestial equator heading south; this occurs on September 22 or
                    23 each year. In ancient times the autumnal equinox lay in Libra, and hence it
                    is still sometimes referred to as ‘the first point of Libra’. However, because of
                    the effect of precession, the autumnal equinox crossed the modern constellation
                    boundary from Libra into Virgo around 730 BC. It continues to move, and will
                    eventually reach Leo in AD 2439. (Ridpath, 170-81)

This sign contains a beautiful star of the first magnitude, 
called Spica. A line drawn from Beta in the head of Bootes, through Arctu-
rus, will lead to Spica, which forms a triangle almost equilateral with Deneb in 
the tail of Leo, and Arcturus. The ecliptic passes a little to the north of Spica. 
A line drawn from Arcturus, between Eta and Upsilon in the ancle of Bootes, 
will show us Vindemiatrix or Epsilon in the northern wing and arm of Virgo. 
The same line produced will point out Beta near the base of the southern wing. 
If from this star a line be drawn a little to the north of Spica, it will pass Eta, 
Gamma and Theta; and by producing it a short distance beyond Theta, it will 
show us Kappa and Lambda in the southern foot. A little to the north of the 
two last mentioned stars are Iota and Phi in the robe, and Mu in the northern 
foot. Between Gamma and Epsilon we find Delta; between Delta and Beta 
we find c on the bosom; and between Spica and Arcturus is Zeta, very near 
the equator. The head of the Virgin is marked by four small stars in a quad-
rilateral figure, about half way between Beta on the southern wing and the tail 
of the Lion.
Virgo is bounded by Bootes, Coma Berenices, Leo, Hydra, and Libra.
On some of the relics of antiquity which have descended to us, this con-
stellation is represented by a female, with an ear of com or with a small sheaf 
of wheat in her hand. The Arabians and Persians have drawn her with an infant 
in her arms. In the oriental zodiac of Sir William Jones, this Virgin stands in 
a boat, holding in one hand a lamp, and in the other a bunch of the rice plant.
We have mentioned that the sign Leo commences the zodiac of Dendera; 
but another zodiac has been discovered in Egypt at Estne, carved on a portico 
among the ruins at that place, commencing with the sign Virgo; and from this 
circumstance it has been argued, that it must be at least two thousand years 
older than the one at Dendera. Some late discoveries respecting Egyptian 
writing, made by M. Champollion, have rendered it more than probable, that 
this ancient relic of astrology at Estne was erected during the reign of the em-
peror Claudius, and that it could have preceded the one at Dendera at most 
but by the duration of his reign, which continued only fourteen years. From 
the remarks we have made on the antiquity of the zodiacs at Dendera, and 
the hint here given respecting the discoveries of Champollion, it will be 
seen that no important chronological inquiry can be determined by these cu-
rious relics of Egyptian ingenuity. We should have passed this subject without 
notice, if the spirit of modern inquiry did not strangely connect the speculations 
of science, and even those of fancy, with the truths of revealed religion. The 
modern philosopher rejects as fabulous the chronology of the Bible, established 
on the uninterrupted evidence of a series of generations, and, by a wonderful 
inconsistency and credulity, places implicit faith in the uncertain interpreta-
tion of Egyptian signs and hieroglyphics, the date and the meaning of which 
are unknown. No attention is paid by him to the proofs which confirm the 
records of the sacred historians, and without being able or without attempting 
fairly to destroy them, he boldly returns to the charge of their insufficiency 
whenever opportunity offers, whether it be in a vein of granite, or in the frag-
ment of an Egyptian ruin.
Virgo is the sixth sign in the zodiac, and is represented by the following 
figure, n; a character which we are unable to explain.
History.--Various accounts have been given of the origin of this sign.
Some say that the Virgin here placed in the skies was, while on earth, Justi-
tia, who lived in the golden age and taught mankind their duty; but who, when 
their crimes increased, was obliged to leave the earth and take her place in 
the heavens. Others say that she is Ceres. The ear of corn which this ce-
lestial maid holds in her hand, evidently denotes the time of harvest, among 
the people who invented this sign.
In the Hebrew zodiac Virgo alludes to Naphthali. (Green, 79-81)</note>

                <note xml:id="TRIANGULAGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Since any three points make up the corners of a triangle it is unsurprising, if
                    somewhat unimaginative, to find a triangle among the constellations. Aratus
                    and Eratosthenes knew this constellation as Δελτωτόν (Deltoton), because its shape resembled a capital delta (Δ), while Ptolemy in the Almagest listed it as
                    Τρίγωνον (Trigonon), triangle.
                    Aratus described it as an isosceles triangle, having two equal sides and a
                    shorter third side. Eratosthenes said that it represented the Nile river delta.
                    According to Hyginus, some people also saw it as the island of Sicily, which was
                    originally known as Trinacria on account of its three promontories. In mythology, Trinacria was the home of Ceres, goddess of agriculture.
                    Alpha Trianguli, magnitude 3.4, is named Mothallah, which comes from the
                    Arabic name for the constellation, al-muthallath, meaning ‘the triangle’. The
                    brightest star in Triangulum is actually Beta Trianguli, magnitude 3.0, but this
                    has no name. Triangulum contains M33, a galaxy in our Local Group sometimes popularly termed the Pinwheel Galaxy, visible with binoculars.
                    A lesser triangle
                    A smaller triangle, Triangulum Minus, was introduced in 1687 by the Polish
                    astronomer Johannes Hevelius who formed it from three stars next to Triangulum. He renamed the existing Triangulum as Triangulum Majus to distinguish
                    it from the smaller sibling. Triangulum Minus was shown on some charts, such
                    as the one reproduced here, but has since fallen into disuse (see also page 207). (Ridpath, 168-9)

A little to the south of the southern foot of Andromeda 
three stars of the fourth magnitude may be seen, in the form of a triangle. It 
will be unnecessary to enter into any particular detail of the manner of finding 
them, as their relative position may be easily ascertained by a reference to the 
map. Two triangles, the Greater and Lesser, are commonly marked on ce-
lestial globes; but as the stars which compose the smaller one, are not of a 
sufficient magnitude to be embraced by our plan, we have not sketched it. 
There is a fine nebula near the Great Triangle, a tittle towards the north, 
which exhibits a continued and regular whitish light. No minute stars can be 
distinguished in it.
The Triangle is bounded by Perseus, Andromeda, Piscis Borealis, Aries, 
and Musca.
History.--According to the Poets, Jupiter assigned the island of Sicily a 
place in the heavens, under the figure of a Triangle. Others say, that the 
large Triangle, owes its origin to some one who wished to represent the figure 
of the Delta in Egypt, among the stars. Although uncertainty hangs over the 
history of the large Triangle, we know that Hevelius introduced the small one, 
which is contiguous to it. The stars which form the small figure can be dis-
tinguished under favourable circumstances. (Green, 40-1)</note>

                <note xml:id="MONOCEROSGLOSS" resp="#DCH">The mythical single-horned beast, the unicorn, is represented by this constellation which was unknown to the ancient Greeks. Monoceros was first depicted
                    in 1612 under the name Monoceros Unicornis on a globe by the Dutch theologian and cartographer Petrus Plancius. This was the same globe on which
                    Camelopardalis, another of his inventions, first appeared.
                    In 1624 the German astronomer Jacob Bartsch depicted it under the name
                    Unicornu (sic) on a star chart in his book Usus Astronomicus Planisphaerii Stellati
                    and as a result he was sometimes wrongly credited with its invention. In his
                    book, Bartsch pointed to several passages in the Bible that supposedly mention
                    unicorns, although these are now regarded as mistranslations. It is not clear
                    whether Plancius introduced the constellation because of these Biblical references, but the unicorn has long been regarded as a Christian symbol of purity.
                    Perhaps Plancius had in mind the Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries woven in the southern Netherlands around a century earlier. The Polish astronomer Johannes
                    Hevelius adopted Monoceros in his influential star atlas and catalogue published
                    in 1690 which ensured its acceptance by other astronomers.
                    Monoceros fills a large area between Hydra and Orion where there was no
                    Greek constellation. It is not prominent (its brightest stars are of fourth mag -
                    nitude) but it lies in the Milky Way and contains a host of fascinating objects,
                    most notably the Rosette Nebula, a wreath-shaped mass of glowing gas with
                    embedded stars. There are no legends associated with the constellation, as it is
                    a modern figure, and none of its stars is named. (Ridpath, 125-6)

                <note xml:id="LIBRAGLOSS" resp="#DCH">In ancient Greek times, the area of sky we know as Libra was occupied by the
                    claws of the scorpion, Scorpius. The Greeks called this area Χηλαί (Chelae),
                    literally meaning ‘claws’, an identification that lives on in the names of the individual stars of Libra (see below). As things have worked out, Libra is now a
                    slightly larger constellation than Scorpius, but is much less conspicuous.
                    The identification of this area with a balance became established in the first
                    century BC among the Romans, although exactly when it was introduced and
                    by whom has been lost in the mists of history. Ptolemy in the Almagest, written
                    around AD 150, continued to refer to this constellation as the Claws, preferring
                    to follow Greek tradition even though it was by then being superseded – for
                    example, Libra was shown as a pair of scales on the celestial globe held by the
                    Farnese Atlas, a Roman statue produced about the same time that the Almagest
                    was being written (see page 27 and Fig. 3).
                    To the Romans, Libra was a favoured constellation. The Moon was said to
                    have been in Libra when Rome was founded. ‘Italy belongs to the Balance, her
                    rightful sign. Beneath it Rome and her sovereignty of the world were founded’, said the Roman writer Manilius. He described Libra as ‘the sign in which the
                    seasons are balanced, and the hours of night and day match each other’. This
                    is a hint that the Romans visualized Libra as a balance because the Sun lay
                    within it at the autumnal equinox, when day and night are equal. However, the
                    idea of a balance in this area did not originate with the Romans. The Babylonians knew this area as ZIB.BA.AN.NA, the balance of heaven, around 1000 BC,
                    when the autumnal equinox lay among its stars. Hence it seems that the
                    Romans revived a constellation that existed even before Greek times.
                    Libra is the only constellation of the zodiac to represent an inanimate object;
                    the other 11 zodiacal constellations represent animals or mythological characters. Once the identification of Libra with a pair of scales became established
                    it was natural to divorce it entirely from Scorpius and to associate it instead
                    with the other flanking zodiacal figure, Virgo, who was identified with Dike or
                    Astraeia, goddess of justice. Libra thus became the scales of justice held aloft
                    by the goddess – although, in the sky, they were positioned at her feet.
                    Libra’s brightest star, second-magnitude Alpha Librae, is called Zubenelgenubi from the Arabic meaning ‘the southern claw’, a reminder of the Greek
                    identification of this constellation with the claws of the scorpion. Beta Librae
                    is Zubeneschamali, ‘the northern claw’. (Ridpath, 116-7)

This sign may be seen to the south-east of the Virgin. 
The scales of the Balance are marked by two stars of the second magnitude, 
one a little above the other. Alpha in the southern scale or basin, may be 
known by following the line of stars in the southern wing and foot of Virgo. 
Beta, in the northern scale, is near Alpha, and on a line between it and Lyra. 
Beta also forms with Arcturus and Spica, a triangle almost equilateral. Iota 
and Gamma, stars of the third magnitude, form a quadrilateral figure with 
Alpha and Beta.
Libra is bounded by Ophiuchus, Virgo, Hydra, Lupus, and Scorpio.
In Sir W. Jones's zodiac a female figure, holding a balance in her hand, 
represents this sign. In the zodiacs at Dendera and Estne, we have the ba-
lance only. The figure of a balance was no doubt given to this constellation, 
because, when the sun arrived in this part of the ecliptic, the days and nights 
were equal,--there was also a great uniformity in the temperature of the air 
over the surface of the earth at this season. Virgil mentions this cluster in 
his Georgics.
Libra die somnique pares ubi fecerit horas
Et medium luci atqne urabris jam dividct orbem.
The Balance was introduced into the Roman zodiac, and perhaps was first 
added to the constellations, in the time of Julius Caesar. Before this, the place 
of Libra was occupied by the projecting claws of the Scorpion. If this suppo-
sition be true, the zodiacs of Dendera and Estne, and others which contain 
this sign, cannot be dated farther back than the reign of that emperor. Hum-
boldt, in his magnificent work on the monuments of the native American na-
tions, seems to think that although Julius Caesar did introduce Libra into the 
Roman calendar, still it might have been used by the Egyptians and other na-
tions before that time. He observes, that in the Arabian hemisphere the belt 
of Orion is designated by the beam of a balance, and one of the Lunar stations 
of the Hindoos bears the same appellation. "It cannot be denied," he con-
tinues, "that the figures of the Egyptian, Chaldean, and Grecian zodiacs were 
known in India from a period of unexplored antiquity, and it is probable that 
when Julius Caesar added the Balance to the Roman zodiac, he did it at the 
suggestion of Sosigenes, a native of Egypt, who could not have been ignorant 
of the division of the ecliptic used in the East." There appears to us no force 
in these remarks. The Romans, we know, received from the Greeks and 
Egyptians the other signs of their zodiac, and if Libra then existed, why was it 
not added at the same time? Besides, we are assured that the most ancient 
Chaldean astronomers divided their zodiac into eleven signs only, making 
Libra a part of Scorpio.
Libra is the seventh sign in the ecliptic, and is marked by the following character, =*, which resembles the scale beam.
History.--The Greeks declare that the Balance was placed among the 
stars to perpetuate the memory of Mochus, the inventor of weights and mea-
sures. This story we think far more probable, than the accounts which they 
have transmitted to us of the origin of the other constellations.
In the Jewish calendar the Balance is allotted to the tribe of Asher. (Green, 81-2)</note>

                <note xml:id="SAGITTARIUSGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Sagittarius is depicted in the sky as a centaur, with the body and four legs of a
                    horse but the upper torso of a man. He is shown wearing a cloak and drawing
                    a bow, aimed in the direction of the neighbouring scorpion, Scorpius. Aratus
                    spoke of the Archer, Τοξότης (Toxotes), and his Bow, Τόξον (Toxon), as though
                    they were separate constellations. Most likely this is because the stars of the bow
                    and arrow are the most distinctive part of the figure. They form the asterism
                    that we now know as the Teapot (see below).
                    Sagittarius is a constellation of Sumerian origin that represented PA.BIL.SAG,
                    a god of war and hunting who they depicted as a centaur-like archer with wings.
                    The Sumerian figure was subsequently adopted by the Greeks, although without
                    the wings. As a result there are no particular myths associated with this constellation and the Greek mythographers were confused as to its identity.
                    Some doubted that this was a centaur at all, among them Eratosthenes who
                    gave as one of his reasons the fact that centaurs did not use bows. Instead,
                    Eratosthenes described Sagittarius as a two-legged creature with the tail of a
                    satyr. He said that this figure was Crotus, son of Eupheme, the nurse to the
                    Muses, who were nine daughters of Zeus. The Roman mythographer Hyginus
                    in his Fabulae added the information that his father was Pan, agreeing with
                    Eratosthenes that the archer was a satyr rather than a centaur.
                    Crotus was said to have invented archery and often went hunting on horseback. He lived on Mount Helicon among the Muses, who enjoyed his company.
                    They sang for him, and he applauded them loudly. The Muses requested that
                    Zeus place him among the stars, where he is seen demonstrating the art of
                    archery. In the sky he was given the hind legs of a horse because he was such a
                    keen horseman.
                    Aratus and Ptolemy, though, both spoke of the archer as four-legged, which
                    is how he is usually depicted. Ptolemy described him with a flowing cloak,
                    known as the ephaptis, attached at his shoulders. By his forefeet is a circle of
                    stars that Hyginus said was a wreath ‘thrown off as by one at play’. This circlet
                    of stars is the constellation Corona Australis (see page 80). Sagittarius was sometimes misidentified as Chiron, a wise and scholarly centaur, but Chiron is in fact
                    represented by the other celestial centaur, the constellation Centaurus.
                    Stars of Sagittarius
                    Alpha Sagittarii is called Rukbat, from the Arabic rukbat al-rami, ‘knee of the
                    archer’. Beta Sagittarii is called Arkab, from the Arabic name meaning ‘the archer’s Achilles tendon’. Gamma Sagittarii is Alnasl, from the Arabic meaning
                    ‘the point’, referring to the tip of the archer’s arrow.
                    Delta, Epsilon, and Lambda Sagittarii are respectively called Kaus Media,
                    Kaus Australis, and Kaus Borealis. The word Kaus comes from the Arabic
                    al-qaus, ‘the bow’, while the suffixes are Latin words signifying the middle,
                    southern, and northern parts of the bow. Zeta Sagittarii is Ascella, a Latin word
                    meaning ‘armpit’. All these names closely follow the descriptions of the stars’
                    positions given by Ptolemy in his Almagest.
                    Last, but not least, is Sigma Sagittarii, called Nunki. This name was applied
                    relatively recently by navigators, but it was borrowed from a list of Babylonian
                    star names. The Babylonian name NUN-KI was given to a group of stars representing their sacred city of Eridu on the Euphrates. The name is now applied
                    to Sigma Sagittarii alone, and is reputedly the oldest star name in use.
                    Ptolemy in the Almagest inexplicably classified the stars that we know as Alpha
                    and Beta Sagittarii as second magnitude, when they are in fact fourth. Bayer, who lived too far north to see these stars for himself, accepted Ptolemy’s assess -
                    ment and labelled them Alpha and Beta. In fact, Alpha Sagittarii is only the
                    15th brightest star in the constellation, over seven times fainter than the brightest
                    star, Epsilon, which is magnitude 1.8.
                    Tea, with milk
                    Among present-day astronomers, the shape outlined by the eight main stars of
                    Sagittarius (Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Lambda, Phi, Sigma, Tau, and Zeta) is
                    popularly known as the Teapot. Its handle consists of Phi, Sigma, Tau, and
                    Zeta, the top of the lid is marked by Lambda, while Delta, Epsilon, and Gamma
                    are the triangu lar spout. This same group of stars, with the addition of Mu
                    Sagittarii, was originally visualized as the archer’s bow and arrow. A subset of
                    these stars – Lambda, Phi, Sigma, Tau, and Zeta – form a ladle shape called
                    the Milk Dipper, fittingly placed in a rich area of the Milky Way.
                    Sagittarius contains dense Milky Way star fields that lie towards the centre
                    of our Galaxy. The exact centre of the Galaxy is believed to be marked by a
                    radio-emitting source that astronomers call Sagittarius A, near the border with
                    Ophiuchus and close to the point of the archer’s arrow. There are many notable
                    objects in Sagittarius, including the Lagoon Nebula and the Trifid Nebula, two
                    much-photographed clouds of gas lit up by stars inside them. (Ridpath, 154-6)

This sign is quite low in the south. The Milky Way passes through the 
Bow and Arrow of Sagittarius. Epsilon, Delta and Lambda are in the Bow, 
and Gamma and Sigma in the Arrow. Zeta, a star of the third magnitude, 
marks the string of the Bow. As this well defined cluster is directly west of 
Antares, it cannot be mistaken. A line drawn from Sigma to the bright star 
in Aquila, will pass through the head of Sagittarius, the outline of which in-
cludes three stars of the fourth magnitude, in a triangular form. Around the 
Bow of Sagittarius the Milky Way is remarkably luminous, and by the aid of a 
telescope, we may there discover, as well as in the body of the Archer himself 
a number of nebulse and little clusters of minute stars.
Sagittarius is bounded by Antinous, Scutum Sobiesci, Ophiuchus, Scorpio. 
Tubus Astronomicus, Corona Australis, Indus et Pavo, Microscopium, and Ca-
pricornus.
It is said that Sagittarius is represented on the Indian zodiacs just as the 
Greeks have copied the figure, which they have transmitted to us. At Den-
dera he is drawn with wings, and with two heads, one of a man which looks 
forwards, and one of a beast in a reversed position.
Sagittarius is the ninth sign in the order of zodiacal constellations, and is 
represented by an arrow or dart, thus /.
History.--The stars in this sign are enclosed in the outlines of a centaur, 
or an animal which is half man and half horse, a figure which was no doubt 
first suggested by seeing a man at a distance on horseback. According to 
some mythologists, this centaur is in memory of Chiron, the son of Saturn, 
who first taught men horsemanship. He also excelled in the science of astro-
nomy, and was greatly skilled in the healing art. His death was occasioned 
by a wound from an arrow dipped in the blood of the Lermean hydra. Others 
say that Sagittarius commemorates a famous hunter by the name of Crotus. 
We are pretty sure that this sign was originally intended as a symbol of the 
hunting season in the fall of the year.
Sagittarius is assigned in the Hebrew zodiac to the half tribe of Manasseh. (Green, 84-5)</note>

                <note xml:id="CANCERGLOSS" resp="#DCH">The crab is a minor character in one of the greatest epics of Greek myth: the
                    labours of Heracles (the Greek name for Hercules). While Heracles was fighting
                    the multi-headed monster called the Hydra in the swamp near Lerna, the crab
                    emerged from the swamp and added its own attack by biting Heracles on the
                    foot. Heracles angrily stamped on the crab, crushing it. For this modest contribution to history, we are told that the goddess Hera, the enemy of Heracles,
                    put the crab among the stars of the zodiac. Its name in Greek was Καρκίνος
                    (Karkinos), or Carcinus in Latin transliteration.
                    Fittingly enough for such a minor character it is the faintest of the zodiacal
                    constellations, with no star brighter than fourth magnitude. The star Alpha
                    Cancri is named Acubens, from the Arabic meaning ‘claw’. As described by
                    Ptolemy in the Almagest, this star lies on the southern claw of the crab; the northern claw is marked by Iota Cancri. Beta and Mu Cancri lie on the southern
                    and northern rear legs, respectively The asses and the manger
                    Gamma and Delta Cancri were known to the Greeks as Ὄνοι (Onoi), the asses;
                    we know them by their Latin names, Asellus Borealis and Asellus Australis, the
                    northern ass and southern ass, and they have their own legend. According to
                    Eratosthenes, during the battle between the gods and the Giants which followed
                    the overthrow of the Titans, the gods Dionysus, Hephaestus, and some companions came riding on donkeys to join the fray. The Giants had never heard
                    the braying of donkeys before and took flight at the noise, thinking that some
                    dreadful monster was about to be unleashed upon them. Dionysus put the asses
                    in the sky, either side of the cluster of stars which the Greeks called Φάτνη
                    (Phatne), the manger, from which the asses seem to be feeding. Ptolemy
                    described Phatne as ‘the nebulous mass in the chest’. Astronomers now know
                    this star cluster by its Latin name Praesepe, but it is popularly termed the
                    Beehive – praesepe can mean both ‘manger’ and ‘hive’.
                    The constellation gives its name to the tropic of Cancer, the latitude on Earth
                    at which the Sun appears overhead at noon on the summer solstice, June 21. In
                    ancient Greek times the Sun lay among the stars of Cancer on this date, but the
                    wobble of the Earth on its axis called precession has since moved the summer
                    solstice from Cancer through neighbouring Gemini and into Taurus (Ridpath, 57-8)

This sign contains no star larger than the fourth magni-
tude. A line drawn from Capella, through Beta in the head of Gemini, will 
show us Alpha in the southern claw. Another line drawn from Aldebaran, 
through Gamma in the feet of Gemini, will also point out this star. A line 
drawn through Alpha and Beta in Gemini, very nearly cuts the Stall or Man-
ger, a group of small stars of the sixth magnitude on the back of the Crab, 
sometimes called the nebulus of Cancer. Two stars of the fourth magnitude, 
marked Theta and Gamma, one to the north and the other to the south of the 
Manger, may readily be seen: the first is called the Northern Asellus, and the 
other the Southern Asellus. Delta, on the meridian, forms a pretty good right-
angled triangle with Theta and Gamma. Other small stars in the claws of the 
Crab, may be found with some difficulty. On the whole, Cancer is no very 
striking group. Near the star Alpha there is an oblong cluster of stars on a 
nebulous ground.
Cancer is bounded by Lynx, Gemini, Canis Minor, Hydra, and Leo.
In the zodiac of Dendera, and in most of the astrological remains of 
Egypt, a scarabseus or beetle is used as the symbol of this sign; but in Sir 
William Jones's oriental zodiac, and in some others found in India, we meet 
with the figure of a Crab. As the Hindoos in all probability derived their 
knowledge of the stars from the Chaldeans, we suppose the figure of the Crab 
in this place to be more ancient than that of the Beetle.
Cancer is the fourth sign in the zodiac, and is marked in astronomical 
books by the number 69 turned sideways, thus, ss. The original hieroglyphic 
figure for this sign is probably lost, as it no doubt bore some analogy to the 
outline of a crab or a beetle.
History.--Many different accounts have been given by the mythologists 
of the origin of this constellation. The most current opinion is, that it is in 
memory of the animal sent by Juno to annoy Hercules during his combat 
with the Lermean hydra. In some eastern representations of this sign, two 
animals like asses are found in this place; and as the Chaldaic name for the 
ass may be translated muddiness, it is supposed to allude to the discolouring 
of the Nile, which was rising when the sun entered Cancer. The Greeks, in 
copying this sign, have placed two asses in it, where they still remain; but 
they explain their reason for doing so, by saying that these are the animals 
which assisted Jupiter in his victory over the giants. (Green, 74-5)</note>

                <note xml:id="GEMINIGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Gemini represents the mythical Greek twins Kastor (Κάστωρ) and Polydeukes
                    (Πολυδεύκης). The Latinized forms of their names are Castor and Pollux (sometimes Polydeuces), by which they are now generally known. The Greeks referred
                    to them jointly as the Dioskouroi (Dioscuri in Latin), literally meaning ‘sons of
                    Zeus’. However, mythologists disputed whether both really were sons of Zeus,
                    because of the unusual circumstances of their birth. Their mother was Leda,
                    Queen of Sparta, whom Zeus visited one day in the form of a swan (represented by the constellation Cygnus). That same night she also slept with her
                    husband, King Tyndareus. Both unions were fruitful, for Leda subsequently
                    gave birth to four children. In the most commonly accepted version, Pollux and
                    Helen (later to become famous as Helen of Troy) were children of Zeus, and
                    hence immortal, while Castor and Clytemnestra were fathered by Tyndareus,
                    and hence were mortal.
                    Castor and Pollux grew up the closest of friends, never quarrelling or acting
                    without consulting each other. They were said to look alike and even to dress
                    alike, as identical twins often do. Castor was a famed horseman and warrior
                    who taught Heracles to fence, while Pollux was a champion boxer.
                    The inseparable twins joined the expedition of Jason and the Argonauts
                    in search of the golden fleece. The boxing skills of Pollux came in use when
                    the Argonauts landed in a region of Asia Minor ruled by Amycus, a son of Poseidon. Amycus, the world’s greatest bully, would not allow visitors to leave
                    until they had fought him in a boxing match, which he invariably won. He
                    stamped down to the shore where the Argo lay and challenged the crew to put
                    up a man against him. Pollux, stirred by the man’s arrogance, accepted at once
                    and the two pulled on leather gloves. Pollux easily avoided the rushes of his
                    opponent, like a matador side-stepping a charging bull, and felled Amycus with
                    a blow to the head that splintered his skull.
                    On the Argonauts’ homeward trip with the golden fleece Castor and Pollux
                    were of further value to the crew. Apollonius Rhodius tells us briefly that during
                    the voyage from the mouth of the Rhone to the Stoechades Islands (the presentday Iles d’Hyères off Toulon) the Argonauts owed their safety to Castor and
                    Pollux. Presumably a storm was involved, but he does not elaborate on the
                    circumstances. Ever since this episode, says Apollonius – and he assures us there
                    were other voyages on which they were saviours – the twins have been the
                    patron saints of sailors. Hyginus said that the twins were given the power to save shipwrecked sailors by Poseidon, the sea god, who also presented them with the
                    white horses that they often rode.
                    Mariners believed that during storms at sea the twins appeared in a ship’s
                    rigging in the form of the electrical phenomenon known as St Elmo’s fire,
                    as described by Pliny, the first-century Roman writer, in his book Natural History:
                    On a voyage stars alight on the yards and other parts of the ship. If there
                    are two of them, they denote safety and portend a successful voyage. For
                    this reason they are called Castor and Pollux, and people pray to them as
                    gods for aid at sea.
                    A single glow was called Helena and was considered a sign of disaster.
                    Castor and Pollux clashed with another pair of twins, Idas and Lynceus, over
                    two beautiful women. Idas and Lynceus (who were also members of the Argo’s
                    crew) were engaged to Phoebe and Hilaira, but Castor and Pollux carried them
                    off. Idas and Lynceus gave pursuit and the two sets of twins fought it out. Castor
                    was run through by a sword thrust from Lynceus, whereupon Pollux killed him.
                    Idas attacked Pollux but was repulsed by a thunderbolt from Zeus.
                    Another story says that the two pairs of twins made up their quarrel over the
                    women, but came to blows over the division of some cattle they had jointly
                    rustled. Whatever the case, Pollux grieved for his fallen brother and asked
                    Zeus that the two should share immortality. Zeus placed them both in the sky
                    as the constellation Gemini, where they are seen in close embrace, inseparable
                    to the last.
                    The two brightest stars in the constellation, marking the heads of the twins,
                    are named Castor and Pollux. Astronomers have found that Castor is actually
                    a complex system of six stars linked by gravity, although to the eye they appear
                    as one. Pollux is an orange giant star. Although Castor is labelled Alpha
                    Geminorum, it is actually fainter than Pollux, which is Beta Geminorum. Unlike
                    the twins that they represent, the stars Castor and Pollux are not related since
                    they lie at different distances from us, 52 and 34 light years respectively. Eta
                    Geminorum is called Propus, from the Greek πρόπους (propous) meaning
                    ‘forward foot’, a name that first appears with Eratosthenes; it arises from the
                    star’s position in the left (leading) foot of the advance twin, Castor.
                    Another identification – Apollo and Heracles
                    Aratus referred to the constellation only as the twins (Δίδυμοι, i.e. Didymoi),
                    without identifying who they were, but a century later Eratosthenes named them
                    as the Dioskouroi, in reference to Castor and Pollux. An alternative view,
                    reported by Hyginus, says that the constellation represents Apollo and Heracles
                    (i.e. Hercules), both sons of Zeus but not twins. Ptolemy called the constellation
                    the Twins (Δίδυμοι) in the Almagest, but in a later, more obscure treatise about
                    astrology, called Tetrabiblos, he referred to Castor as ‘the star of Apollo’ and
                    Pollux as ‘the star of Heracles’, supporting the identifications given by Hyginus.
                    Several star charts personify the twins as Apollo and Heracles. On the illustration from John Flamsteed’s atlas shown here, for example, one twin is
                    depicted holding a lyre and arrow, attributes of Apollo, while the other carries
                    a club, as did Heracles. Bode’s Uranographia depicts them in the same way. (Ridpath, 97-99)

Two stars of the second magnitude, marked Alpha and 
Beta, determine the heads of Gemini. Alpha, the most northern star of the 
two, is in the head of Castor, and may be found by considering Capella the ver-
tex of an isosceles triangle, whose base is toward the south. Aldebaran con-
stitutes the second angle of this triangle, and Castor the third. Beta or Pollux, 
which is obliquely below Castor, and about four degrees from it, cannot be 
mistaken. The stars in the feet of Gemini are nearly in a straight line, and 
almost parallel to those in the head. Gamma, the principal star in this line, 
may be found by drawing a line from Eta, through Gamma of the Great Bear. 
Zi is south of Gamma, and Nu and Mu to the north of it. Eta is a little below 
Mu. A line drawn from Beta in the head of Pollux, to Gamma in his foot, 
will give Delta in the body and Zeta in the knee. Delta is on the ecliptic. A 
line drawn from Alpha in the head of Castor, to Mu in his foot, will give Epsi-
lon in his knee. Gamma, Nu, Epsilon and Zeta, form a very regular four-
sided figure. Kappa and Iota in the shoulders, and Theta in the northern arm 
of Castor, are on a line with Capella. Other stars in Gemini may be found by 
referring from the plate to the heavens. A small star, marked H on the charts, 
near to Eta and just before the foot of Castor, is called Propus. This star 
served for many years to determine the position of the planet Herschell. The 
Milky Way passes through the feet of Gemini. There are two nebulae in this 
group. The star Epsilon appears double.
Gemini is bounded by Lynx, Telescopium Herschelii, Auriga, Orion, Mo-
noceros, Canis Minor, and Cancer.
Gemini is the third sign in the zodiac, and is represented by the following 
character, n; a very apt hieroglyphic of the union of two bodies.
On one of the zodiacs found in Egypt the Twins are represented by two 
sitting figures, with their arms extended; their heads are covered, which is an 
emblem denoting both dignity and power. This sign, on both the zodiacs of 
Dendera, is represented by a man and woman in a walking attitude, with this 
remarkable difference, however, the female figure on the zodiac in the portico 
has the head of one of the inferior animals, most probably that of a dog, in re-
ference to Anubis, or the planet Mercury typified by Anubis. On the oriental 
zodiac of Sir William Jones, we have Gemini represented by a boy and a girl 
embracing. Many other varieties in the ancient delineations of this sign might 
be noticed. They all agree in portraying two individuals united by the bonds 
of natural affection.
History.--There is great diversity of opinion among ancient authors re-
specting this constellation. Some say that it is Apollo and Hercules, and others 
Triptolemus and Jasion; but the most probable supposition is, it was intended 
by the Greeks in honour of Castor and Pollux, two sons of Jupiter. Accord-
ing to the fable, after the death of Castor, his brother, who was immortal, en-
treated his father, either to restore him to life, or else to deprive him of exist-
ence. This request was refused by Jupiter, but he permitted Castor to share 
equally in the life of his brother, or that they should live and die alternately 
every day. This decree was gladly accepted by Pollux, and consequently as 
long as one was on the earth the other was in the regions of the dead. From 
what we have already said, it will be seen that the Greeks can lay no just claim 
to the invention of this sign. They must have copied it from the Egyptian, or 
perhaps the Indian, representation of this group.
In the Hebrew zodiac, the Twins are referred to the tribe of Benjamin. (Green, 70-2)</note>

                <note xml:id="LYRAGLOSS" resp="#DCH">A compact but prominent constellation, marked by the fifth-brightest star in the
                    sky, Vega. Mythologically, Lyra (Λύρα in Greek) was the lyre of the great
                    musician Orpheus, whose venture into the Underworld is one of the most
                    famous of Greek stories. It was the first lyre ever made, having been invented
                    by Hermes, the son of Zeus and Maia (one of the Pleiades). Hermes fashioned
                    the lyre from the shell of a tortoise that he found browsing outside his cave on
                    Mount Cyllene in Arcadia. Hermes cleaned out the shell, pierced its rim and
                    tied across it seven strings of cow gut, the same as the number of the Pleiades.
                    He also invented the plectrum with which to play the instrument.
                    The lyre got Hermes out of trouble after a youthful exploit in which he stole
                    some of Apollo’s cattle. Apollo angrily came to demand their return, but when
                    he heard the beautiful music of the lyre he let Hermes keep the cattle and took
                    the lyre in exchange. Eratosthenes says that Apollo later gave the lyre to
                    Orpheus to accompany his songs.
                    Orpheus was the greatest musician of his age, able to charm rocks and
                    streams with the magic of his songs. He was even reputed to have attracted rows
                    of oak trees down to the coast of Thrace with the music of his lyre. Orpheus joined the expedition of Jason and the Argonauts in search of the golden fleece.
                    When the Argonauts heard the tempting song of the Sirens, sea nymphs who
                    had lured generations of sailors to destruction, Orpheus sang a counter melody
                    that drowned the Sirens’ voices.
                    Orpheus and Eurydice
                    Later, Orpheus married the nymph Eurydice. One day, Eurydice was spied by
                    Aristaeus, a son of Apollo, who attacked her in a fit of passion. Fleeing from
                    him, she stepped on a snake and died from its poisonous bite. Orpheus was
                    heartbroken; unable to live without his young wife, Orpheus descended into the
                    Underworld to plead for her release. Such a request was unprecedented. But
                    the sound of his music charmed even the cold heart of Hades, god of the
                    Underworld, who finally agreed to let Eurydice accompany Orpheus back to the land of the living on one solemn condition: Orpheus must not at any stage
                    look behind him until the couple were safely back in daylight.
                    Orpheus readily accepted, and led Eurydice through the dark passage that
                    led to the upper world, strumming his lyre to guide her. It was an unnerving
                    feeling to be followed by a ghost. He could never be quite sure that his beloved
                    was following, but he dared not look back. Eventually, as they approached the
                    surface, his nerve gave out. He turned around to confirm that Eurydice was still
                    there – and at that moment she slipped back into the depths of the Underworld,
                    out of his grasp for ever.
                    Orpheus was inconsolable. Thereafter he wandered the countryside, plaintively playing his lyre. Many women offered themselves to the great musician in
                    marriage, but he preferred the company of young boys.
                    The death of Orpheus
                    There are two accounts of the death of Orpheus. One version, told by Ovid in
                    his Metamorphoses, says that the local women, offended at being rejected by
                    Orpheus, ganged up on him as he sat singing one day. They began to throw
                    rocks and spears at him. At first his music charmed the weapons so that they fell
                    harmlessly at his feet, but the women raised such a din that they eventually
                    drowned the magic music and the missiles found their mark.
                    Eratosthenes, on the other hand, says that Orpheus incurred the wrath of
                    the god Dionysus by not making sacrifices to him. Orpheus regarded Apollo,
                    the Sun god, as the supreme deity and would often sit on the summit of Mount
                    Pangaeum awaiting dawn so that he could be the first to salute the Sun with
                    his melodies. In retribution for this snub, Dionysus sent his manic followers to
                    tear Orpheus limb from limb. Either way, Orpheus finally joined his beloved
                    Eurydice in the Underworld, while the muses put the lyre among the stars with
                    the approval of Zeus, their father.
                    Vega and other stars
                    Ptolemy knew the constellation’s brightest star simply as Λύρα (Lyra), the same
                    name as the constellation. The name we use for this star today, Vega, comes
                    from the Arabic words al-nasr al-waqi’ which can mean either ‘the swooping
                    eagle’ or ‘vulture’, for the Arabs saw both an eagle and a vulture here. The
                    constellation was often depicted on star maps as a bird positioned behind a lyre,
                    as in the illustration on the previous page. It seems that the Arabs visualized
                    Vega and its two nearby stars Epsilon and Zeta Lyrae as an eagle with folded
                    wings, swooping down in its prey, whereas in the nearby constellation Aquila
                    the star Altair and its two attendant stars gave the impression of a flying eagle
                    with wings outstretched. Vega is 25 light years away.
                    Beta Lyrae is called Sheliak, a name that comes from the Arabic for ‘harp’,
                    in reference to the constellation as a whole. Beta Lyrae is a celebrated variable
                    star. Gamma Lyrae is called Sulafat, from the Arabic meaning ‘the tortoise’,
                    after the animal from whose shell Hermes made the lyre. Between Beta and
                    Gamma Lyrae lies the Ring Nebula, often pictured in astronomy books; it is a
                    shell of gas like a celestial smoke ring, thrown off by a dying star. (Ridpath, 120-2)

This constellation lies in a southern direction from the 
head of Draco. A line drawn from Kochab to the head of Draco, and pro-
duced to about an equal distance, will give us Alpha or Wega, a beautiful star 
of the first magnitude in the Harp. Wega may also be known, as it forms the 
right angle of a large triangle with the Pole star and Arcturus, a bright star 
which we shall presently notice. Beta, Gamma and Delta are small but con-
spicuous stars, in the form of a triangle, a little to the south of Wega. Epsilon 
and Zeta, two small stars between Delta and Wega, form a triangle with Delta. 
These are on most maps put down as of the fifth magnitude: we have marked 
them of the fourth. In this cluster there is a fine nebula, which, if examined 
with a good telescope, appears of an oval form.
This group is bounded by Draco, Cygnus, Hercules, and Vulpecula et 
Anser.
History.--On some celestial maps this constellation is represented without 
the Vulture; but the bird is often seen, as we have figured it on our plate. 
This group is sometimes called the falling or descending Vulture, because it 
looks toward the south, and seems to be flying downwards, and Aquila, which 
is not far distant, has then the name of the ascending Vulture. This constella-
tion is supposed to be represented on some of the Egyptian obelisks as an em-
blem of spring. The Harp has had its place in the sky much longer than the 
Vulture. There is some difficulty in determining to what celebrated personage the 
Lyre or Harp, which is carried by the Vulture, belongs. The most pro-
bable conjecture seems to be, that it was intended to perpetuate the famous in-
strument with which Orpheus captivated the fair Eurydice. Such was the 
power of this instrument in the hand of Orpheus, that when he entered the 
regions of the dead in search of Eurydice, who was killed by the bite of a ser-
pent, that Pluto himself was charmed with its strains, the wheel of Ixion ceased 
to move, the stone of Sisyphus stood still, Tantalus forgot his thirst, the Furies 
themselves relented, and Proserpine consented to restore Eurydice to the re-
gions of day. (Green, 44-5)</note>

                <note xml:id="TRIANGULUMAUSTRALEGLOSS" resp="#DCH"><!--Green only has one entry for the Triangles.--> One of the 12 constellations introduced at the end of the 16th century by the
                    Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, and the
                    smallest of them according to modern boundaries. A southern triangle had
                    previously been shown in a completely different position, south of Argo Navis,
                    on a globe of 1589 by the Dutchman Petrus Plancius, along with a southern
                    cross, but they were not the constellations we know today. The modern Triangulum Australe was first depicted in 1598 on a globe by Petrus Plancius and first
                    appeared in print in 1603 on the Uranometria atlas of Johann Bayer.
                    The three main stars of Triangulum Australe are brighter than those of
                    their northern counterpart, although the constellation is smaller. Navigators
                    have named its brightest star Atria, a contraction of its scientific name Alpha
                    Trianguli Australis.
                    On his 1756 planisphere of the southern stars the French astronomer Nicolas
                    Louis de Lacaille referred to it as ‘le Triangle Austral ou le Niveau’ (‘niveau’
                    meaning level) and he even showed it with an attached plumb bob, indicating
                    that he regarded it as representing a surveyor’s level. ‘Niveau’ was later Latinized to ‘libella’, as on Bode’s atlas shown here. Through some misreading, the historian R. H. Allen transferred the appellation ‘level’ to the nearby constellation
                    Norma and termed that constellation the Level and Square (instead of the Rule
                    and Square), thereby confusing generations of astronomers. (Ridpath, 169-70)</note>

                <note xml:id="CAPRICORNUSGLOSS" resp="#DCH">Capricornus is an unlikely looking creature, with the head and forelegs of a goat
                    and the tail of a fish. The constellation evidently originated with the Sumerians
                    and Babylonians, who had a fondness for amphibious creatures; the ancient
                    Sumerians called it SUHUR-MASH-HA, the goat-fish. But to the Greeks, who
                    named it Αἰγόκερως (Aigokeros, or Aegoceros in Latin transliteration), meaning
                    goat-horned, the constellation was identified with Pan, god of the countryside,
                    who had the horns and legs of a goat.
                    Pan, a playful creature of uncertain parentage, spent much of his time
                    chasing females or sleeping it off with a siesta. He could frighten people with
                    his loud shout, which is the origin of the word ‘panic’. One of his offspring was
                    Crotus, identified with the constellation Sagittarius. Pan’s attempted seduction of the nymph Syrinx failed when she turned herself into a handful of reeds. As
                    he clutched the reeds the wind blew through them, creating an enchanting
                    sound. Pan selected reeds of different lengths and stuck them together with wax
                    to form the famous pipes of Pan, also called the syrinx.
                    Pan came to the rescue of the gods on two separate occasions. During the
                    battle of the gods and the Titans, Pan blew a conch shell to help put the enemy
                    to flight. According to Eratosthenes his connection with the conch shell accounts
                    for his fishy nature in the sky, although Hyginus says somewhat absurdly that it
                    is because he hurled shellfish at the enemy. On a later occasion, Pan shouted a
                    warning to the gods that the monster Typhon was approaching, sent by Mother
                    Earth (Gaia) against the gods. At Pan’s suggestion the gods disguised themselves
                    as animals to elude the monster. Pan himself took refuge in a river, turning the
                    lower part of his body into a fish.
                    Zeus grappled with Typhon, but the monster pulled out the sinews from
                    Zeus’s hands and feet, leaving the god crippled. Hermes and Pan replaced the
                    sinews, allowing Zeus to resume his pursuit of Typhon. Zeus cut down the
                    monster with thunderbolts and finally buried him under Mount Etna in Sicily,
                    which still belches fire from the monster’s breath. In gratitude for these services,
                    Zeus placed the image of Pan in the sky as the constellation Capricornus.
                    The star Alpha Capricorni is called Algedi, from the Arabic al-jady meaning
                    ‘the kid’, the Arabic name for the constellation. Delta Capricorni is called Deneb
                    Algedi, from the Arabic for ‘the kid’s tail’. As defined by the modern IAU
                    boundaries Capricornus is the smallest of the 12 constellations of the zodiac,
                    occupying less than a third the area of the largest zodiacal constellation, Virgo.
                    The constellation gives its name to the tropic of Capricorn, the latitude on
                    Earth at which the Sun appears overhead at noon on the winter solstice, around
                    December 22. In Greek times the Sun was in Capricornus on this date, but as
                    a result of precession the Sun is now in Sagittarius at the winter solstice. (Ridpath, 65-6)

This sign is south of Delphinus and Antinous, and contains 
but a few remarkable stars. There are two in the head of the third magnitude, 
marked Alpha and Beta. Alpha, which is the most northern star, is double. 
They may both be found by drawing a line from Lyra to the bright star in 
Aquila, and then producing it in a southern direction. Two stars of the fourth 
magnitude, in the tail, may be known by drawing a line from Gamma in the 
middle of the Cross of Cygnus, through the quadrilateral figure in Equuleus.
Capricornus is bounded by Antinous, Sagittarius, Microscopium, Globus 
AErostaticus, and Aquarius.
In almost all the ancient zodiacs which have descended to us, we find 
the symbol which represents this sign very much the same. On some astro-
logical fragments the Goat is fastened by a cord to Anubis. On the oriental 
zodiac of Sir W. Jones, this group is represented by a fish swallowing an an-
telope. The Greeks lay no claim to the invention of this sign, but refer its 
origin to the Egyptians.
Capricorn is the tenth zodiacal constellation, and is represented by the 
following character >j, which is an outline of the head of a goat, with a crooked 
horn on the right side.
History.--Some mythologists say that Capricoruus represents the goat
Amalthea, which nourished Jupiter during his infancy; but as we have before s
tated, it is probable that that animal was placed in the arms of Auriga. Others 
explain by another fable, this singular representation of Capricorn, which is 
drawn having the fore part of a goat joined to the body and tail of a fish. On 
a certain occasion, it is said, Pan, with some other deities, were feasting near 
the banks of the Nile, when suddenly the giant Typhon appeared among them. 
This occasioned so much terror that they all changed themselves into different 
forms and fled in every direction. Pan, who was the guardian of hunters 
and shepherds, plunged into the river; that part of his body which was under 
the water assumed the form of a fish, and the other part that of a goat. Ju-
piter, in order to preserve the memory of this event, placed this fantastic ani-
mal among the stars.
In the Hebrew zodiac Capricornus alludes to Zebulon. (Green, 87-8)</note>

                <note xml:id="MILKYWAYGLOSS" resp="#DCH">The Milky Way is not, of course, a constellation, but a band of faint light crossing the sky, consisting of countless distant stars. Aratus wrote of the sky being
                    ‘cleft all around by a broad band’ which he called Γάλα (Gala, the Greek for
                    milk). Eratosthenes called it Κύκλος Γαλαξίας (Kýklos Galaxías), the circle of
                    milk. Ptolemy in the Almagest spelled the name γαλακτίας (galaktías).
                    The Roman writer Manilius compared the Milky Way to the luminous wake
                    of a ship. Ovid in his Metamorphoses described it as a road lined on either side
                    by the houses of distinguished gods – ‘the Palatine district of high heaven’, he
                    termed it. Along this road the gods supposedly travelled to the palace of Zeus.
                    Eratosthenes tells us that the Milky Way was the result of a trick played by
                    Zeus on his wife Hera so that she would suckle his illegitimate son Heracles and
                    hence make him immortal. Hermes laid the infant Heracles at Hera’s breast
                    while she was asleep, but when she woke and realized who the baby was –
                    perhaps by the strength with which he sucked – she pushed him away and her
                    milk squirted across the sky to form the Milky Way.
                    Manilius listed various explanations for the Milky Way that were current in
                    his day, both scientific and mythological. One suggestion was that it is the seam
                    where the two halves of the heavens are joined – or, conversely, where the two
                    halves are coming apart like a split in the ceiling, letting in light from beyond.
                    Alternatively, said Manilius, it might be a former path of the Sun, now covered
                    in ash where the sky was scorched. Some thought that it could mark the route
                    taken by Phaethon when he careered across the sky in the chariot of the Sun
                    god, Helios, setting the sky on fire (see Eridanus, pages 94–96). Yet again, noted
                    Manilius, it could be a mass of faint stars, an idea attributed to the Greek
                    philosopher Democritus of the fifth century BC, which we now know to be
                    correct. Finally, on a quasi-religious note, Manilius suggested that the Milky Way
                    could be the abode of the souls of heroes who had ascended to heaven.
                    In Chinese astronomy the Milky Way was Tianhe, the Celestial River, also
                    translatable as River of Heaven. Nine stars in Cygnus, including Deneb, represented Tianjin, a ford across the river at a point where it appeared to be
                    particularly shallow; the impression of shallowness comes about because a dark
                    cloud of dust in the local spiral arm of our Galaxy obscures part of the Milky
                    Way in this region.
                    To the Arabs of the Middle Ages the Milky Way was known as al-madjarra,
                    from a word meaning a place where something is pulled or drawn along, such
                    as a cart track. It seems that Arab scientists such as al-Bīrūnī (973–1048) understood the Milky Way’s true nature as a distant mass of stars, which was finally
                    confirmed by Galileo’s telescopic observations in 1610. (Ridpath, 184)

The Milky Way, or Galaxy as it is sometimes called, is certainly one of the 
most striking objects in the sky. When examined without the assistance of the 
telescope, it appears as a broad track or path, of a whitish colour, encompassing 
the heavens. Its form, its breadth, and its colour are various in different parts 
of its course; in some places it is dense and luminous, in others it is scattered 
and faint: its breadth is often not more than five degrees, and sometimes it is ten 
or sixteen. In some places it assumes a double path, but for the most part it is 
single. It may be traced in the heavens beginning near the head of Cepheus, 
about thirty degrees from the north pole, through the constellations Cassiopeia, 
Perseus, Auriga, and part of Orion and Gemini, where it crosses the Zodiac. 
In the southern hemisphere it takes in the Ship Argo, Charles's Oak, the Cross, 
the feet of the Centaur and the Altar. Here it divides into two branches, as it 
passes over the Zodiac again into the northern hemisphere. One branch runs 
through the tail of Scorpio, the bow of Sagittarius, the slucld of Sobieski, the 
feet of Antinous, Aquila, Delphinus, Sagitta, and the southern wing of Cygnus. 
The other branch passes through the upper part of the tail of Scorpio, the side 
of Serpentarius, Taurus Poniatovii, Anser, and the neck of Cygnus, where it 
unites with the other, and they then pass on to the head of Cepheus, where 
there is a small opening. There arc some traces of the same kind of light 
as that which is emitted from the Milky Way near the south pole, but they are 
small and faint.
Some ancient philosophers maintained that the Sun had once gone in this 
track before he entered the ecliptic, and that its whiteness proceeded from the 
remains of his light. The Poets had the odd fancy that the Galaxy was the 
path which their deities used in the heavens, and which led immediately to the 
abode of Jupiter. Milton alludes to this in the following lines: 
"A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold, 
And pavement stars, as stars to us appear 
Seen in the Galaxy." 
By the help of the telescope we now are able to demonstrate that this path or 
zone in the heavens, consists of an immense multitude of minute stars, seem-
ingly very close to each other, whose mingled light gives it the whitish tinge it 
usually assumes. Dr. Herschel considers it a stratum of nebulous matter, ana-
logous to that which appears in little spots in many other places, or that it is a 
continued assemblage of nebulae. The term nebula is applied to little specks 
which shine with a dim, hazy light. These are seldom distinguished with the 
naked eye, but if a good telescope be applied to them, they appear to be lumi-
nous spots of various figures, and may be resolved into little clusters of minute 
stars. The number of nebulae before the time of Herschel, was estimated at one hundred and 
three; but previous to April, 1784, he added four hundred and 
sixty to this list. Telescopes of a still greater power than the one he used would 
no doubt enable us to discover many more. Herschel has offered a bold and 
sublime theory on this subject. He supposes the starry heavens to be replete 
with these nebulae, and that each of them is a distinct and separate system, in-
dependent of the rest. The Milky Way he imagines to be that particular ne-
bula in which our Sun is placed, and from the numerous and accurate obser-
vations which he has made on nebulous appearances, he has certainly rendered his 
hypothesis very plausible. (Green, 19-20)</note>
