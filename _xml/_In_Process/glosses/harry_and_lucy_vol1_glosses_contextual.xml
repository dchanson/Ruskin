                    while on their way to the seaside (not when arrived), <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> challenges <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> to guess &#x201c;&#x2018;what length . . . the silk&#x2010;worm can spin without breaking&#x2019;&#x201d;. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName>, thinking to provoke <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> with an exaggerated answer, 
                    suggests a quarter&#x2010;mile. &#x201c;&#x2018;A quarter of a mile! . . . &#x2018;that is a good large guess; but you must know, that a silk&#x2010;worm can spin without breaking as much as when unwound is six miles long!&#x2019;&#x201d; 
                    This information arises from a discussion of spiders (prompted by sighting their webs glistening with dew, as they travel)&#x2014;in particular, 
                    the &#x201c;&#x2018;silk spider, who spins silk, which is almost as fine, some say finer, than that of the silk&#x2010;worm&#x2019;&#x201d;.</p>
                    
                    <p>All this is prelude to &#x201c;&#x2018;<hi rend="italic">the grand thing</hi>&#x2019;&#x201d; that <persName type="ficitonal" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> looks forward to seeing 
                        in <placeName corresp="#LANCASHIRE">Lancashire</placeName>&#x2014;a working steam engine in a cotton mill. After examining the machinery, they learn that the produce, a skein of cotton yarn, 
                    &#x201c;&#x2018;if stretched out, would make a thread one hundred and sixty&#x2010;seven miles in length&#x2019;&#x201d;. This achievement, the children decide, puts their spiders and silkworms in the shade, 
                    but their father remarks &#x201c;that the proper object of comparison between rival spinners is, not the length of the thread, but the fineness. &#x2018;And I apprehend&#x2019;, said he, 
                    &#x2018;that either a silk&#x2010;worm or spiders&#x02bc; thread, is as fine as one fibre of cotton wool; and the finest thread of cotton <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be composed of many fibres&#x2019; 
                    So that, notwithstanding <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName>&#x02bc;s exultation in the superiority of men and women spinners over worms and spiders, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> was compelled to give judgment in favour of the animals&#x201d;

                    With the father snared into the narrative, the speaker declares that &#x201c;we shall have time to attend to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">harry</persName>&#x201d;,

                        distracted by play outdoors and by the more entertaining reading that occupyies his sister, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MARYME">Mary</persName>. 
                        Amid these distractions, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> has studied only fitfully, trying &#x201c;the patience of a mother&#x201d; who has more time to hear his imperfectly memorized lesson. 
                        When even his <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MAMMAMEFS">mother</persName> limits the number of recitals she will entertain, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> turns to his compliant sister. 
                        Although untrained in Latin, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MARYME">Mary</persName> reads well enough to warn him to be more exact (1:58, 75).</p>
                    
                    <p>Unlike the successful manipulation of auditors by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName>, which leaves her parents with no option but bemused compliance, 
                        <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02bc;s episode poses a test of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName>&#x02bc;s resolve to memorize his lesson efficiently and on time, 
                        that he may &#x201c;early learn habits of attention and application&#x201d; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><hi rend="italic">Frank: A Sequel</hi></title></ref>, 1:89). 
                        His failure leads the adults to confer among themselves, as do the parents in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s version, 
                        but the discussion between <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02bc;s adults is solemn, reflecting the book&#x02bc;s thesis, which is set forth in the author&#x02bc;s preface: 
                        parents should instill habits of self&#x2010;control in their sons before sending them to public school. 
                        If parents neglect to train their sons in self&#x2010;command, the boys will succumb to their schoolfellows&#x02bc; reckless challenges to prove their &#x201c;manliness&#x201d; 
                        in foolish and damaging ways. The argument is not that proper manliness is to be instilled by corporal punishment: 
                        <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName>&#x02bc;s response to his disgrace ultimately disproves <persName type="fictional" corresp="#COLONELBIRCHME">Colonel Birch</persName>&#x02bc;s contention that a boy will learn his Latin 
                        only if its rules are &#x201c;flogged&#x201d; into him by schoolmasters. Rather, as <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> demonstrates, self&#x2010;control must be mastered by the boy himself. 
                        Recovering from his sobs, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> retires to gain control over himself and his get his lesson by heart. Then, in the scene that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> adapts to his own purposes, 
                        <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> &#x201c;march[es] up&#x201d; to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#COLONELBIRCHME">Colonel Birch</persName> to say his lesson perfectly (just as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> &#x201c;marched up&#x201d; to her <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PAPA">father</persName> 
                        to command his time, but without disgracing herself like <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName>). In <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02bc;s tale, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> proves over the following weeks that he can be relied on, 
                        and his <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PAPAMEFS">father</persName> rescinds his decision to send <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> to school earlier than originally planned 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><hi rend="italic">Frank: A Sequel</hi></title></ref>, 1:86&#x2013;96).</p>
                    
                    <p>According to <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="book" corresp="#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><hi rend="italic">Frank: A Sequel</hi></title>, the cultural cause of parental laxness in instilling boys&#x02bc; self&#x2010;discipline is not neglect of education, 
                        but a parents&#x02bc; preoccupation with and excessive intervention in learning. The &#x201c;fault of the present day&#x201d;, according to the author&#x02bc;s preface, 
                        is the phenomenon of &#x201c;anxious private education&#x201d;. While the danger to a home&#x2010;schooled boy is effeminacy, the undermining of manliness 
                        is caused only in part by living too much at home &#x201c;&#x2018;with gentle girls and women&#x2019;&#x201d;. In contemporary home education, both fathers and mothers 
                        can be at fault for &#x201c;too much anxiety concerning details. Parents and private tutors are not only too eager to adopt every new receipt 
                        for teaching much in a short time, but are also too easily alarmed by every deficiency which they perceive in their pupils, 
                        and draw too readily evil auguries from every trifle. They are so anxious to make their pupils go on, and go right, 
                        and go straight, every instant, that they deprive them of the power of acting, thinking, feeling for themselves. 
                        Thus they turn them either into helpless puppets, who must cease to move, or fall when the guiding strings are no longer pulled; 
                        or, if they be not reduced to this automaton state, they become restive, wilful creatures, who, the instant they are at liberty, 
                        set off in a contrary direction to that in which they have been forced&#x201d; (1:54, xvi&#x2013;xvii).</p>
                    
                    <p>To reward <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> for disciplining himself in his lessons, his <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PAPAMEFS">father</persName> allows him &#x201c;what I know will be agreeable&#x201d;, teaching him to ride&#x2014;and 
                        not &#x201c;the old pony; or, as <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> would call it, the <hi rend="italic">tame</hi> pony&#x201d;, but a &#x201c;spirited&#x201d; horse. 
                        When his <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MAMMAMEFS">mother</persName> demurs, his <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PAPAMEFS">father</persName> explains: &#x201c;Boys, who have been carefully brought up at home, have often something effeminate or precise about them; 
                        perhaps they do not know how to leap, or to run, or to ride; for this they are laughed at by their school&#x2010;fellows, and they often get into mischief, 
                        merely to show that they are manly&#x201d; (1:97, 98, 100). The earliest reference in the family letters to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> riding his Shetland pony,

                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s invented experiment, in which gunpowder is exploded in balloons positioned at different heights, although improbable, 
                        does demonstrate the point of a scenario that <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02bc;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FATHERJJ">Father</persName> bids his young listeners to imagine: 
                        &#x201c;&#x2018;You see in a dark night the flash of a gun, but, 
                    being at a considerable distance from it, you hear no report. If, however, you knew that the light was occasioned 
                    by the inflammation of gunpowder in a musket or pistol, you would conclude that it was attended with sound, 
                    though it was not sufficiently strong to reach the place where you are.&#x2019;&#x201d; <persName type="fictional" corresp="#CHARLESJJ">Charles</persName> shows that he gets the point 
                    by recalling an actual experience of the same kind: &#x201c;&#x2018;As we were walking last summer towards <placeName corresp="#HAMPSTEAD">Hampstead</placeName>,

                    and you desired <persName type="fictional" corresp="#EMMAJJ">Emma</persName> and me to take notice as we approached the spot, how much sooner the report was heard after we saw the flash, 
                    than it was when we first got into the fields&#x2019;&#x201d;. His <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FATHERJJ">father</persName> ties together the past experience and the present conversation: 
                    &#x201c;&#x2018;My intention [at that time] was, that you should know, 
                    from actual experiment, that sound is not conveyed instantaneously, but takes a certain time to travel over a given space&#x201d;&#x2019;

                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s experiment encapsulates discussion of the speed of sound, but inaudible sounds in <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName> have more to do with showing that

                    His summary of the procedure for lifting and supporting a ship&#x02bc;s keel, besides being slightly inaccurate, 
                    is difficult to follow, because <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> omits <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName>&#x02bc;s contextualizing.</p>
                    
                    <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> begins with more obvious and traditional means of raising a ship in dry dock: 
                    &#x201c;&#x2018;Some time ago, the day my <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PAPAME">father</persName> took me into the dock&#x2010;yard, he showed me a ship lying in what is called a dock. 
                    The keel was to be repaired, and for this purpose it was necessary to raise up the ship, so that the workmen might get underneath. 
                    The question my <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PAPAME">father</persName> asked me was, &#x2018;how the vessel could be raised?&#x2019; I was an hour puzzling about it, . . . 
                    but never [thought] of the easy way that was before my eyes&#x2014;to let in the water from outside of the dock. The water,
                    you know, would gradually float the vessel, and raise it up to the proper height, where it could be propped up, and the water let out again next tide.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p>
                    
                    <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> inquires about a &#x201c;different way of raising a ship&#x201d; that she knows their <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PAPAME">father</persName> had described to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName>. 
                        <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> goes on: &#x201c;&#x2018;You must first of all know, that when a vessel is floated into a dock to be repaired, 
                        <hi rend="italic">she</hi> is allowed to settle down with her keel upon thick wooden blocks, along the middle of the dock: 
                        . . . formerly when she was to be raised up, for the people to get under the keel, two or three hundred <hi rend="italic">shores</hi>, 
                        or props of timber, were placed all under her bottom, nearly upright; wedges were then just pointed under the lower end of each of these shores, 
                        and all the workmen from every part of the dock&#x2010;yard being summoned with their <hi rend="italic">mauls</hi>, or huge hammers, 
                        and stationed one or two to each shore, the wedges were all struck at the same instant by word of command. 
                        A few blows from all the mauls was sufficient just to raise the ship from off the blocks, which were then taken away, 
                        and the ship was left hanging in the air, supported by the shores&#x2019;&#x201d;.</p>
                    
                    <p>The new way, which has replaced this time&#x2010; and labor&#x2010;intensive method, is what <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> summarizes: 
                        &#x201c;&#x2018;The blocks on which the keel is to lie are not solid lumps of wood; they are composed of three pieces, two of which are <hi rend="italic">wedges</hi>, 
                        and when these are knocked out, the centre piece of the block falls. The ship is floated into the dock as usual, 
                        and when the water subsides, the keel rests on the new&#x2010;fashioned blocks: the forest of shores are then firmly placed 
                        under all parts of the ship&#x02bc;s bottom, in the same way as I described to you before, but without any wedges [pointed beneath the shores]. 
                        Now, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName>, comes the beautiful contrivance&#x2014;two or three men only are sufficient to do the rest: 
                        they give a few knocks on the sides of the wedges, of which the blocks are composed&#x2014;out they fly&#x2014;the blocks sink, 
                        and the ship hangs on the shores&#x2019;&#x201d;.</p>
                    
                    <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> agrees that &#x201c;&#x2018;it is such a pretty contrivance, that 1 should like very much to see it done.

                    in which <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> travel to <placeName corresp="#BRISTOL">Bristol</placeName>. Specifically, the observation of mountains by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> could be a borrowing from <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>, 
                    not only because <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02bc;s characters travel to the West Country, but also because <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02bc;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName>, 
                    from the moment he hears the prospect of going to the seaside, longs &#x201c;&#x2018;to see mountains, and go up them with my portable barometer&#x2019;&#x201d; (1:186). 
                    This desire arises near the beginning of the book, when <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> proposes to measure the height of a mountain by comparing the difference between barometric pressures at sea level and at the top the mountain, 
                    and converting the difference in degrees to a scale in feet. Prior to their journey, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> and his <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PAPAME">father</persName> carry out the experiment on a more limited scale by scaling 
                    a church tower with the portable barometer in hand, thereby working out the tower&#x02bc;s height. <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName> uses this episode to prompt learning through several comparisons of a thematic kind, 
                    including tensions between <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName>&#x02bc;s bent for theorizing and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName>&#x02bc;s pragmatism, between <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName>&#x02bc;s solemn methodicalness and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName>&#x02bc;s mercurial imaginativeness, 
                    and between <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName>&#x02bc;s braving adventures to the point of imprudence and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName>&#x02bc;s voicing anxieties to the point of endangering others (see 1:19&#x2013;38).</p>
                    
                    <p>As

                    This portion of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s narrative was taken by <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> to be &#x201c;probably a bit of history&#x201d; 
                    solely on the grounds, it seeems, that the adventures are &#x201c;told with lively artlessness&#x201d;

                     But while <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> folds in at least one episode directly from <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName> (the exploding wagon), 
                    it does seem unlikely that he would wholly invent a journey taken in the opposite direction from <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02bc;s characters, 
                    unless his parents had actually taken him to <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName>&#x2014;a place that, compared to <placeName corresp="#BRISTOL">Bristol</placeName> and environs, 
                    had only recently begun promoting itself as a tourist destination. Tending to the confirm the basis in reality, 
                    the Ruskins are known to have visited <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName> on at least one other occasion, and probably more (see

                        owing not only to their picturesque beauty but also to their settlement with villas. On the London Road beyond the spa, 
                        &#x201c;the characteristic feature of the country&#x201d; is hard sandstone, which forms &#x201c;various considerable prominences&#x201d; that can &#x201c;assume the majestic character of rocks&#x201d;

                    <p>The family is traveling in their carriage and conversing, when <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> interjects: &#x201c;&#x2018;<persName type="fictional" corresp="#PAPAME">Father</persName>! pray look out of the window this instant!

                        The wagoner &#x201c;had no clear idea of the danger he had run, till <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName>&#x02bc;s father told him, that he had some years before known a waggon 
                    to have been blown to pieces, and men and horses killed, by just such an accident. Some gunpowder had been shaken out of a barrel 
                    in the waggon, and had taken fire, as it is supposed, from a spark struck from a flint in the road. This communicating with the gunpowder 
                    had blown up the whole&#x201d;. The wagoner is a &#x201c;sulky fellow&#x201d; and disbelieves the story until hearing the name of the hill where the accident occurred. 
                    The narrator observes: &#x201c;So it is, that ignorant people believe or disbelieve, without any reasonable grounds&#x201d;. The wagon&#x02bc;s passengers, 
                    overhearing the explanation, express their gratitude, and the wagoner moderates his demeanor. Speaking in a country dialect, 
                    which <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName> imitates, he thanks <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> for doing them &#x201c;&#x2018;a mortal good turn&#x2019;&#x201d; and offers him a service in return,

                    the day of the year when the sun appears highest in the sky and daylight extends the longest. Since on that day the sun would have set around seven, 
                    which was the regular hour for tea, the twilight gives Harry the impression that tea is served "<hi rend="italic">seemingly</hi>" at three in the afternoon--referring not just to the lingering light 
                    but probably more specifically to the expected hour for dinner. This schedule appears in keeping with the day as described at the beginning of chapter eight, 
                    with Harry coming inside loaded with shells from the beach, which he is "counting . . . over when . . . interrupted by dinner", followed by lessons and drawing, and then tea, and bed afterward.</p>
                    
                    <p>As Judith Flanders remarks, dinner at three was considered an older convention in the nineteenth century--observed, for example, 
                        by Dora Spenlow's old-fashioned maiden aunts in <title type="book" corresp="#DICKENSDAVIDCOPPERFIELD"><hi rend="italic">David Copperfield</hi></title>, who correspondingly take their tea at six-thirty in the evening. 
                        Fashionable life later in the century called for evening dining at six or seven. Even the elder Ruskins, when entertaining, liked an evening dinner, 
                        so John James could sit up until midnight talking with friends. When married, John and Effie apparently set an unusually early dinner of one in the afternoon at their Park Street, London, house, 
                        followed by an evening tea, but this schedule would have revolved around John's work 
                        (Flanders, Inside the Victorian Home, 267-68; Dickens, David Copperfield, ed. Burgis, 584 [chap. 41]; Cooper, Effie, 55).</p></note>
