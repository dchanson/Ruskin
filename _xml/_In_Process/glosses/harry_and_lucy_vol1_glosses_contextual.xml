                    occurs only twice in Edgeworth, Harry and Lucy Concluded;

                    the good-natured and intelligent son of the engineer, that the boys at Lewis's school raise silkworms. He describes how they feed the caterpillars 
                    with mulberry leaves and collect the silk from the cacoons: "'I have wound a great deal of it myself'", Lewis exclaims, 
                    and shows Frank and Mary the yellow silk wound on cards". Mary wishes she could raise silkworms too, but Lewis advises against it, 
                    since they emit a "disagreeable smell . . . and sometimes eat till they burst" 
                    (Edgeworth, Frank: A Sequel, 2:275-76). At Herne Hill, 
                    the Ruskins' back garden enclosed an old mulberry tree (Dearden, John Ruskin's Camberwell, 1).</p></note>

                    while on their way to the seaside (not when arrived), Lucy challenges Harry to guess "'what length . . . the silk-worm can spin without breaking'". Harry, thinking to provoke Lucy with an exaggerated answer, 
                    suggests a quarter-mile. "'A quarter of a mile! . . . 'that is a good large guess; but you must know, that a silk-worm can spin without breaking as much as when unwound is six miles long!'" 
                    This information arises from a discussion of spiders (prompted by sighting their webs glistening with dew, as they travel)--in particular, 
                    the "'silk spider, who spins silk, which is almost as fine, some say finer, than that of the silk-worm'". All this is prelude to "'<hi rend="italic">the grand thing</hi>" 
                    Harry looks forward to seeing in Lancashire--a working steam engine in a cotton mill. After examining the machinery, they learn that the produce, a skein of cotton yarn, 
                    "'if stretched out, would make a thread one hundred and sixty-seven miles in length'". This achievement, the children decide, puts their spiders and silkworms in the shade, 
                    but their father remarks "that the proper object of comparison between rival spinners is, not the length of the thread, but the fineness. 'And I apprehend', said he, 
                    'that either a silk-worm or spiders' thread, is as fine as one fibre of cotton wool; and the finest thread of cotton <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be composed of many fibres' 
                    So that, notwithstanding Lucy's exultation in the superiority of men and women spinners over worms and spiders, Harry was compelled to give judgment in favour of the animals" 
                    (Edgeworth, Harry and Lucy Concluded, 1:205-6, 203, 230-31).</p></note>

                    its closing with a quotation mark, is the first instance of third-person narration in Ruskin's 
                    "Harry and Lucy", which up until this point is composed entirely of dialogue. This brief tag of narration is answered by a second passage of third-person narration (likewise punctuated with a closing quotation mark), 
                    in which a narrator addresses the reader ("we shall . . . attend to"). The two passages of narration frame an exchange in the voices of the parents, 
                    who knowingly confide in one another about Lucy's maneuver: the "cause" that "made Lucy not come to say her lesson to me", Mamma implies, 
                    is that Lucy has extracted a promise from her father to hear her lesson, despite Papa's pressing lack of "time". 
                    With the father snared into the narrative, the speaker declares that "we shall have time to attend to harry", 
                    and the narrative shifts to his "story".</p>
                    
                    <p>In Maria Edgeworth's Frank: A Sequel to Frank in Early Lessons, 
                        rather than the child choosing the parental auditor and commanding the auditor's time, as Ruskin's Lucy does, 
                        Frank is ordered by his father to recite his Latin lesson when the father reserves the time to hear him. 
                        Edgeworth's father is impatient of time--"'I cannot stand here talking or listening to you, my dear, all day'”--and 
                        Frank is assured by a family friend, the ominously named Colonel Birch, that "'there are very few fathers who would shorten 
                        their morning's ride for the sake of hearing their son's Latin lesson'” (Edgeworth, Frank: A Sequel, 1:52, 78). 
                        When the time comes to recite his lesson, Frank is disgraced, because he has procrastinated, 
                        distracted by play outdoors and by the more entertaining reading that occupyies his sister, Mary. 
                        Amid these distractions, Frank has studied only fitfully, trying "the patience of a mother" who has more time to hear his imperfectly memorized lesson. 
                        When even his mother limits the number of recitals she will entertain, Frank turns to his compliant sister. 
                        Although untrained in Latin, Mary reads well enough to warn him to be more exact (1:58, 75).</p>
                    
                    <p>Unlike the successful manipulation of auditors by Ruskin's Lucy, which leaves her parents with no option but bemused compliance, 
                        Edgeworth's episode poses a test of Frank's resolve to memorize his lesson efficiently and on time, 
                        that he may "early learn habits of attention and application" (Edgeworth, Frank: A Sequel, 1:89). 
                        His failure leads the adults to confer among themselves, as do the parents in Ruskin's version, 
                        but the discussion between Edgeworth's adults is solemn, reflecting the book's thesis, which is set forth in the author's preface: 
                        parents should instill habits of self-control in their sons before sending them to public school. 
                        If parents neglect to train their sons in self-command, the boys will succumb to their schoolfellows' reckless challenges to prove their "manliness" 
                        in foolish and damaging ways. The argument is not that proper manliness is to be instilled by corporal punishment: 
                        Franks's response to his disgrace ultimately disproves Colonel Birch's contention that a boy will learn his Latin 
                        only if its rules are "flogged" into him by schoolmasters. Rather, as Frank demonstrates, self-control must be mastered by the boy himself. 
                        Recovering from his sobs, Frank retires to gain control over himself and his get his lesson by heart. Then, in the scene that Ruskin adapts to his own purposes, 
                        Frank "march[es] up" to Colonel Birch to say hia lesson perfectly (just as Ruskin's Lucy "marched up" to her father 
                        to command his time, but without disgracing herself like Harry). In Edgeworth's tale, Frank proves over the following weeks that he can be relied on, 
                        and his father rescinds his decision to send Frank to school earlier than originally planned 
                        (see Edgeworth, Frank: A Sequel, 1:86-96).</p>
                    
                    <p>According to Edgeworth's Frank: A Sequel, the cultural cause of parental laxness in instilling boys' self-discipline is not neglect of education, 
                        but a parents' preoccupation with and excessive intervention in learning. The "fault of the present day", according to the author's preface, 
                        is the phenomenon of "anxious private education". While the danger to a home-schooled boy is effeminacy, the undermining of manliness 
                        is caused only in part by living too much at home "'with gentle girls and women'". In contemporary home education, both fathers and mothers 
                        can be at fault for "too much anxiety concerning details. Parents and private tutors are not only too eager to adopt every new receipt 
                        for teaching much in a short time, but are also too easily alarmed by every deficiency which they perceive in their pupils, 
                        and draw too readily evil auguries from every trifle. They are so anxious to make their pupils go on, and go right, 
                        and go straight, every instant, that they deprive them of the power of acting, thinking, feeling for themselves. 
                        Thus they turn them either into helpless puppets, who must cease to move, or fall when the guiding strings are no longer pulled; 
                        or, if they be not reduced to this automaton state, they become restive, wilful creatures, who, the instant they are at liberty, 
                        set off in a contrary direction to that in which they have been forced" (1:54, xvi-xvii).</p>
                    
                    <p>To reward Frank for disciplining himself in his lessons, his father allows him "what I know will be agreeable", teaching him to ride--and 
                        not "the old pony; or, as Frank would call it, the <hi rend="italic">tame</hi> pony", but a "spirited" horse. 
                        When his mother demurs, his father explains: "Boys, who have been carefully brought up at home, have often something effeminate or precise about them; 
                        perhaps they do not know how to leap, or to run, or to ride; for this they are laughed at by their school-fellows, and they often get into mischief, 
                        merely to show that they are manly" (1:97, 98, 100). The earliest reference in the family letters to Ruskin riding his Shetland pony, 
                        Shagram, is January 1829, about two years after composing his "Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I" 
                        (John to John James Ruskin, 19 January 1829 [Burd, ed., Ruskin Family Letters, 172]).</p></note>

                    (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title>)&#x2014;</hi>In Edgeworth's Harry and Lucy Concluded, 
                    the children's father promises that, "'when we go to London, I will show you Mr. Carey's apparatus for making ice'".  
                    Using a portable air pump, their father has been conducting an experiment to demonstrate "that sudden evaporation produces cold 
                    sufficient to freeze in a vacuum"; and Harry hopes to adapt this experiment to prove to Lucy that the air pump is not limited to scientific uses, 
                    but good also for practical applications, such as helping to make ice cream. That part of their experiment using cream and sweetmeat fails; 
                    and their father explains "that, for this purpose, much larger air pumps than they had ever seen would be necessary" 
                    (1:151, 145, 150, and see 2:252). (Mr. Carey and his ice-making apparatus in London are unidentified.)</p>
                    
                    <p>When Edgeworth's Lucy refuses at first to believe Harry's assertion that "'the air pump can make ice'", he assigns her reading in 
                        Conversations on Chemistry (1:140-41). John James Ruskin owned this book by Jane Marcet (1769-1858), the popular writer on science 
                        and children's book author, who first published the book in 1805 for the edification of women. (The mother in Edgeworth's Harry and Lucy Concluded claims to know personally 
                        the mother in Conversations, who holds dialogues on the principles of chemistry with her two daughters.)
                        In Conversation IV on the properties of specific and latent heat, the same experiment is performed as that undertaken 
                        by Harry and Lucy's father, but explained in theoretical terms rather than with the practical emphasis in Harry and Lucy Concluded 
                        (Marcet, Conversations on Chemistry, 1:141-42, 144). In a note, Marcet credits the originator of the experiment, 
                        Sir John Leslie (1766-1832), who in 1810, with the aid of an air pump, first demonstrated the phenomenon of falling temperature produced by evaporation in 1810. 
                        In a widely publicized case concerning this experiment, an imputation of plagiarism among other accusations by Blackwoods Magazine 
                        provoked Leslie to take the editors to court for libel in 1822 (Napier, Memoir of Sir John Leslie, 23-26).</p>

                    prompting "young readers" to "recollect" events from "the last volumes of harry and Lucy", echoes the aspirations of Edgeworth's Lucy 
                    at the beginning of Harry and Lucy Concluded: Lucy sighs because "'I do not <hi rend="italic">go on</hi> with Harry as I used to do'" 
                    because they "'do not suit each other quite so well as we did'". Harry, she complains, "'has grown so excessively fond of mechanics, 
                    and of all those scientific things, which he is always learning from my uncle and papa'". Her mother points out that she has been 
                    "'learning other things, which it is more necessary for a girl to know'". She encourages Lucy, however, to seek her brother's teaching in science, 
                    and in turn to share her "stories and poetry" and drawing: "'You each know different things, which you can learn from one another, 
                    and in which you can be of mutual assistance. This is just as it should be between friends'” 
                    (Edgeworth, Harry and Lucy Concluded, 1:1, 2-3, 4, 5).</p>
                    
                    <p>In subsequent lessons, Edgeworth's pair learn to forbear with one another, as Harry's methodical efficiency is tested by Lucy's impulsiveness, 
                        and he learns to understand wit and appreciate poetry while she learns go slowly and methodically in scientific learning--their opposite abilites 
                        made complementary by a loving relationship (in Edgeworth, Harry and Lucy Concluded, see, e.g., the preface, and the lesson about hygrometers, 1:xiii-xiv, 38-86). 
                        In Ruskin's dialogue, the brief exchange between Harry and Lucy concerning whether he will "go on with science" with her now or tomorrow 
                        glancingly reflects these contests in Edgeworth between Harry's humorless exactingness and Lucy's volatility and "nonsense". Ruskin's dialogue 
                        does not directly reflect what is, in Edgeworth, at stake for Lucy as girl, learning how women become "agreeable companions to . . . sensible men" 
                        by preparing themselves with a "'taste for literature, and some acquaintance with scientific subjects'" without acquiring the stigma attached to "scientific ladies" 
                        (1:7-11).</p></note>

                    (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title>)&#x2014;</hi>Unless he was drawing directly on an unidentified source, 
                    Ruskin appears to have devised his own fictional experiment based on Conversation XI, "Of Sound", 
                    in volume 4, "Of Pneumatics", in Scientific Dialogues by Jeremiah Joyce.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the conversation by Joyce, the father conducts no experiments of his own involving sound, but describes experiments by others 
                        and poses hypothetical illustrations--embellished with lines from Capell Lofft's Eudosia--in order to explain phenomena of sound to his children, Charles and Emma. 
                        Ruskin's invented experiment, in which gunpowder is exploded in balloons positioned at different heights, although improbable, 
                        does demonstrate the point of a scenario that Joyce's Father bids his young listeners to imagine: 
                        "'You see in a dark night the flash of a gun, but, 
                    being at a considerable distance from it, you hear no report. If, however, you knew that the light was occasioned 
                    by the inflammation of gunpowder in a musket or pistol, you would conclude that it was attended with sound, 
                    though it was not sufficiently strong to reach the place where you are.'" Charles shows that he gets the point 
                    by recalling an actual experience of the same kind: "'As we were walking last summer towards Hampstead, 
                    we saw a party of soldiers firing at a mark near Chalk Farm, 
                    and you desired Emma and me to take notice as we approached the spot, how much sooner the report was heard after we saw the flash, 
                    than it was when we first got into the fields'". His father ties together the past experience and the present conversation: 
                    "'My intention [at that time] was, that you should know, 
                    from actual experiment, that sound is not conveyed instantaneously, but takes a certain time to travel over a given space'" 
                    (Joyce, Scientific Dialogues, 4:102, 103-4; Chalk Farm, near Primrose Hill in Hampstead, was known as a remote place for dueling 
                    in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries [Wheatley, London Past and Present, 1:344-45]).</p>
                    
                    <p>In Ruskin's devising his own imaginary experiment to measure near and distant sounds of exploding gunpowder, 
                        his lexical choices--the closer noise being "so much that it was near deafing <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">harry</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName>", 
                    while the more distant "noise could not be heard" at all--suggest that he conflated two different sections of Joyce's dialogue. 
                    Ruskin's experiment encapsulates discussion of the speed of sound, but inaudible sounds in Joyce have more to do with showing that 
                    sound cannot travel in a vacuum: "'I remember'", says Charles, "'being once in a room at the distance of but a few paces from the Tower guns when they fired 
                    [i.e., artillery in the Tower of London], and the noise was infinitely worse than any thunder that I ever heard'". 
                    His father explains, "'This was because you were near them: gunpowder, so tremendous as it is in air, 
                    when inflamed in a <hi rend="italic">vacuum</hi> makes no . . . sound'"

                    (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title>)&#x2014;</hi>Ruskin draws this account of how ships are repaired in dry dock 
                    from an exchange between brother and sister in Edgeworth's Harry and Lucy Concluded. 
                    His summary of the procedure for lifting and supporting a ship's keel, besides being slightly inaccurate, 
                    is difficult to follow, because Ruskin omits Harry's contextualizing.</p>
                    
                    <p>Harry begins with more obvious and traditional means of raising a ship in dry dock: 
                    "'Some time ago, the day my father took me into the dock-yard, he showed me a ship lying in what is called a dock. 
                    The keel was to be repaired, and for this purpose it was necessary to raise up the ship, so that the workmen might get underneath. 
                    The question my father asked me was, 'how the vessel could be raised?' I was an hour puzzling about it, . . . 
                    but never [thought] of the easy way that was before my eyes--to let in the water from outside of the dock. The water,
                    you know, would gradually float the vessel, and raise it up to the proper height, where it could be propped up, and the water let out again next tide.'"</p>
                    
                    <p>Lucy inquires about a "different way of raising a ship" that she knows their father had described to Harry. 
                        Harry goes on: "'You must first of all know, that when a vessel is floated into a dock to be repaired, 
                        <hi rend="italic">she</hi> is allowed to settle down with her keel upon thick wooden blocks, along the middle of the dock: 
                        . . . formerly when she was to be raised up, for the people to get under the keel, two or three hundred <hi rend="italic">shores</hi>, 
                        or props of timber, were placed all under her bottom, nearly upright; wedges were then just pointed under the lower end of each of these shores, 
                        and all the workmen from every part of the dock-yard being summoned with their <hi rend="italic">mauls</hi>, or huge hammers, 
                        and stationed one or two to each shore, the wedges were all struck at the same instant by word of command. 
                        A few blows from all the mauls was sufficient just to raise the ship from off the blocks, which were then taken away, 
                        and the ship was left hanging in the air, supported by the shores'".</p>
                    
                    <p>The new way, which has replaced this time- and labor-intensive method, is what Ruskin summarizes: 
                        "'The blocks on which the keel is to lie are not solid lumps of wood; they are composed of three pieces, two of which are <hi rend="italic">wedges</hi>, 
                        and when these are knocked out, the centre piece of the block falls. The ship is floated into the dock as usual, 
                        and when the water subsides, the keel rests on the new-fashioned blocks: the forest of shores are then firmly placed 
                        under all parts of the ship's bottom, in the same way as I described to you before, but without any wedges [pointed beneath the shores]. 
                        Now, Lucy, comes the beautiful contrivance—-two or three men only are sufficient to do the rest: 
                        they give a few knocks on the sides of the wedges, of which the blocks are composed—-out they fly-—the blocks sink, 
                        and the ship hangs on the shores'".</p>
                    
                    <p>Lucy agrees that "'it is such a pretty contrivance, that 1 should like very much to see it done. 
                        Suppose you make an experiment with your little boat in our canal'" (Edgeworth, Harry and Lucy Concluded, 4:234-37). 
                        Edgeworth's Harry temporizes, but Ruskin carries on to invent just such a scene for his fictional siblings in their garden, 
                        where they examine Harry's workmanship in constructing blocks and shores to lift a boat in his little canal.</p></note>

                    may intend both Harry's cane experiment and its accidental outcome as proofs of the "attraction of cohesion",

                    Father explains: "That a piece of thin steel, or cane, recovers its usual form, after being bent, 
                    is owing to a certain power called <hi rend="italic">elasticity</hi>; which may, perhaps, arise from the particles of those bodies, 
                    though disturbed, not being drawn out of each other's attraction; therefore, as soon as the force upon them ceases to act, 
                    they restore themselves to their former position". However, "the reverse of the attraction of cohesion" or "repulsion" 
                    prevails "if a glass or any hard substance be broken", and "the parts cannot be made to cohere without first being moistened, 
                    because the repulsion is too great to admit of a reunion" (Joyce, Scientific Dialogues, 1:37, 36).</p></note>

                    Presumably the latter is intended since, in a traveling chariot or chaise such as the Ruskins used for long-distance travel in the summer holiday, 
                    only a child could sit opposite the single seat for two adults--and that child-seat had to be improvised, such as the packing box that served as young Ruskin's seat (see

                    that they thought they had been made by mens hands&#x201d; (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title>)&#x2014;</hi>Ruskin's 
                    idea of incorporating a travel narrative into his version of Edgeworthian lesson was probably suggested by Edgeworth's Harry and Lucy Concluded, 
                    in which Harry and Lucy travel to Bristol. Specifically, the observation of mountains by Ruskin's Harry and Lucy could be a borrowing from Edgeworth, 
                    not only because Edgeworth's characters travel to the West Country, but also because Edgeworth's Harry, 
                    from the moment he hears the prospect of going to the seaside, longs "'to see mountains, and go up them with my portable barometer'" (1:186). 
                    This desire arises near the beginning of the book, when Harry proposes to measure the height of a mountain by comparing the difference between barometric pressures at sea level and at the top the mountain, 
                    and converting the difference in degrees to a scale in feet. Prior to their journey, Harry and his father carry out the experiment on a more limited scale by scaling 
                    a church tower with the portable barometer in hand, thereby working out the tower's height. Edgeworth uses this episode to prompt learning through several comparisons of a thematic kind, 
                    including tensions between Harry's bent for theorizing and Lucy's pragmatism, between Harry's solemn methodicalness and Lucy's mercurial imaginativeness, 
                    and between Harry's braving adventures to the point of imprudence and Lucy's voicing anxieties to the point of endangering others (see 1:19-38).</p>
                    
                    <p>As 
                    announced on their arrival below, Harry and Lucy are traveling to Hastings on the southeast coast of England. 
                    This portion of Ruskin's narrative was taken by W. G. Collingwood to be "probably a bit of history" 
                    solely on the grounds, it seeems, that the adventures are "told with lively artlessness" 
                    (Collingwood, Life and Work of John Ruskin [1893], 1:25; Collingwood, Life of John Ruskin [1900], 21). 
                     But while Ruskin folds in at least one episode directly from Edgeworth (the exploding wagon), 
                    it does seem unlikely that he would wholly invent a journey taken in the opposite direction from Edgeworth's characters, 
                    unless his parents had actually taken him to Hastings--a place that, compared to Bristol and environs, 
                    had only recently begun promoting itself as a tourist destination. Tending to the confirm the basis in reality, 
                    the Ruskins are known to have visited Hastings on at least one other occasion, and probably more (see 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="seaside_resorts_note.php">The Ruskins' Visits to Seaside Resorts and Spas</ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p>Here, in Ruskin's Harry and Lucy, the description of the road trip to Hastings seems only marginally credible, however, 
                        and one strains to match his details with a reality that Ruskin may have half-remembered and half-created. There are no mountains in Kent, 
                        for example, although there are hills that "Harry" may have decided to call "mountains". The 1826 edition of the road book, <title type="book" corresp="#MOGGPATERSONSROADS">Paterson's Roads</title>, 
                        lists two routes for the sixty-four-mile journey to Hastings from London (measured from London Bridge)--one following the post road to Flimwell in Kent 
                        (roughly the present-day A21) through Sevenoaks, Tonbridge, Lamberhurst, Hurst Green, Robertsbridge, and Battle; and another segueing at Tonbridge to Tunbridge Wells 
                        (roughly the present-day A26 and A267), passing through Southborough, Tunbridge Wells, Frant, and Shover's Green, to rejoin the post road to Flimwell at Ticehurst 
                        (Mogg, Paterson's Roads, 17-18). Harry's "mountains" could refer broadly to the Weald of Kent and Sussex viewed from these routes, or to a particular spot 
                        such as the resort, Tunbridge Wells. As an 1810 topograhical account describes the settlement, Tunbridge Wells 
                        lay in a valley and spread over "adjacent hills of a wild forest aspect, with rocks of considerable magnitude". 
                        The village's three hills--named Mount Sion, Mount Pleasant, and Mount Ephraim--might have been described as "made by mens hands" 
                        owing not only to their picturesque beauty but also to their settlement with villas. On the London Road beyond the spa, 
                        "the characteristic feature of the country" is hard sandstone, which forms "various considerable prominences" that can "assume the majestic character of rocks" 
                        (Amsinck, Tunbridge Wells and Its Neighbourhood, 2, 42).</p></note>

                    neither of the two main routes runs alongside a stream as considerable as a "river". Only Tonbridge (then spelled Tunbridge), 
                    where the road divides into the two routes toward Tunbridge Wells and Lamburhurst, respectively, 
                    is situated on a river, the Medway. As the guidebooks liked to comment, the town was "built on a spot, intersected by five small branches of the river Medway; 
                    and from the bridges over these several streams it obtained its name, the Town of Bridges" 
                    (Amsinck, Tunbridge Wells and Its Neighbourhood, 97).</p></note>

                    entails only the threat of fire, and not an actual conflagration, but the episode also involves Harry in an interaction with strangers on the road.</p>
                    
                    <p>The family is traveling in their carriage and conversing, when Harry interjects: "'Father! pray look out of the window this instant! 
                    Do you see that streak of black powder in the track of the waggon, papa? I saw it dribbling from a barrel. Is it not gunpowder? May I get out and look?'" 
                    Harry and his father dismount and run to catch up with the vehicle, which is transporting goods and passengers, to warn the driver of the danger. 
                    The wagoner "had no clear idea of the danger he had run, till Harry's father told him, that he had some years before known a waggon 
                    to have been blown to pieces, and men and horses killed, by just such an accident. Some gunpowder had been shaken out of a barrel 
                    in the waggon, and had taken fire, as it is supposed, from a spark struck from a flint in the road. This communicating with the gunpowder 
                    had blown up the whole". The wagoner is s "sulky fellow" and disbelieves the story until hearing the name of the hill where the accident occurred. 
                    The narrator observes: "So it is, that ignorant people believe or disbelieve, without any reasonable grounds". The wagon's passengers, 
                    overhearing the explanation, express their gratitude, and the wagoner moderates his demeanor. Speaking in a country dialect, 
                    which Edgeworth imitates, he thanks Harry for doing them "'a mortal good turn'" and offers him a service in return, 
                    "'but the likes of I can do little for the likes of you gem'men'". Harry assures the wagoner that he is sufficiently rewarded 
                    by the safety of the vehicle and its passengers. The lesson of the episode, as Harry's father summarizes it, is to 
                    “'see how useful it is to observe what passes before your eyes, and to recollect what you know at the right time'",

                    called Fairlight Down. An 1804 guidebook describes the view: "It opens on a smooth terrace from the Down, from whence is an extensive prospect of Pevensey Bay [where William the Conqueror is supposed to have landed], 
                    Beachy Head, Bourne Hills, and a wide range of sea; when through the turnpike gate, the Valley of Hastings appears, discovering the Upper Church, and the tops of houses". 
                    When the narrator reports that "they had got to the entrance of hastings", the guidebook is cued for the second vantage: "At the bottom of the hill 
                    you enter a pleasant shady lane, on each side of which are tall spreading trees, whose branches in the summer form an impenetrable arch, 
                    through which you enter to the town" (<title type="book" corresp="#HASTINGSGUIDE1804"><hi rend="italic">Hastings Guide</hi> [1804]</title>, 40-41). 
                    The guidebook features an engraving, <title type="artwork" corresp="HASTINGSGUIDE1804VIEWFROMLONDONROAD"><hi rend="italic">View of the Entrance to Hastings by the London Road</hi></title>, 
                    which positions the viewer on the higher vantage, overlooking the town to the sea beyond, 
                    while the lower, tree-lined town entrance is pictured in W. G. Moss's engraving, <title type="artwork" corresp="#MOSSENTRANCETOHASTINGS"><hi rend="italic">Entrance from the London Road</hi></title>,

                    "the spirit of improvement, and increase of building", according to W. G. Moss in 1824, which left but "few old habitations remaining in the town", 
                    such as "those at the bottom of All Saint's-street, which, having the long diagonal gable ends descending from their roofs", were 
                    "characteristic of the houses of Elizabeth's time, . . . which is stated to have been the prevailing style of architecture of . . . the whole town, forty or fifty years ago" 
                    (<title type="book" corresp="#MOSSHASTINGS">History and Antiquities of the Town and Port of Hastings</title>, 124). 
                    The term <hi rend="italic">improvement</hi> was used in the period to characterize the large-scale city planning and imposition of a uniform style, 
                    such as John Nash's designs for Regent's Park in London, that could change the character of a city (Summerson, Georgian London, 198).</p>
                    
                    <p>When the Ruskins visited in 1826, Pelham Place was under construction by excavating into the cliff fronting the beach. This terraced housing, 
                    reminiscent of the Regent's Park terraces in London, forms a crescent with a Greek Revival chapel in the center. It was designed by Joseph Kay (1775-1847), 
                    Hotels included the Castle, recently built when the Ruskins visited, which 
                    stood on Wellington Square, sheltered by the cliff, but looking out to "views of the surrounding country, [the chalk cliff] Beachy-head, and the sea" 
                    (<title type="book" corresp="#MOSSHASTINGS">History and Antiquities of the Town and Port of Hastings</title>, 146-47). Besides the Castle Hotel, 
                        other accommodations offering ocean views, according to P. M. Powell's <title type="book" corresp="#POWELLHASTINGSGUIDE"><hi rend="italic">Hastings Guide</hi></title> (ca. 1819), 
                        included the Royal Oak Inn "on the beach, in Castle Street", and the Cutter Inn (pp. 29-31).</p></note>

                    From the fields near the village of Fairlight, a view across the Channel to the French coast would have interested the Ruskins 
                    for its Napoleonic landmarks, given the family's recent <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1825_note.php">Tour of <date when="1825">1825</date></ref>

                    being a distance of nearly eighty miles; the whole extent of the French coast, from Calais Cliffs to Boulogne; 
                    and the <title type="artwork" corresp="#COLONNEDELAGRANDEARMEE">Napolean Tower</title>, which stands on a lofty eminence 
                    about two miles from the town, and which was designed by the French army assembled at Boulogne,
                    under the command of Buonaparte, (self-styled the <orgName corresp="#ARMEEDANGLETERRE">army of England</orgName>,) to commemorate the projected conq[u]est of this country; 
                    it now remains the monument of the Usurper’s folly. . . . In the nearer view may be distinguished the towns . . . and innumerable villages . . . 
                    of the counties of Sussex and Kent" (Powell, <title type="book" corresp="#POWELLHASTINGSGUIDE"><hi rend="italic">Hastings Guide</hi></title>, 73-74). 
                    In the 1820s, the triumphal column undertaken by the Arm&#x00E9;e d'Angleterre at Boulogne--today known as the Colonne de la grande Arm&#x00E9;e (1804-41)--had already been altered 
                    "to commemorate the restoration of the House of Bourbon" (Starke, Travels in Europe between the Years 1824 and 1828, 4; and see 
                    Chandler, Napoleon, 59-60, for these events of 1803-4 connected with Britain's formation of the Third Coalition).</p>
                    
                    <p>Other excursions to ocean views, which were within walking distance, but which less clearly fit Ruskin's description, 
                        were the walks to the Dripping Well, Fairlight Place, and the Lover's Seat 
                        (<title type="book" corresp="#POWELLHASTINGSGUIDE"><hi rend="italic">Hastings Guide</hi></title>, 75-76).
