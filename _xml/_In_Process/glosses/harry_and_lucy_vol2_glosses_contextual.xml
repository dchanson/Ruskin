                1Ruskin wrote “seme.”
                2Ruskin wrote “new.”
                3In these early printed (as opposed to longhand) texts, Ruskin occasionally imitates the appearance of italic type, and this appears his intention here—unless he is merely squeezing the word into its space at the end of the line. The second e is missing in the original.
                4Ruskin frequently makes the error of using apostrophes to signify plurals.
                In manuscript, “butterfly” is divided across pages 6 and 7—i.e., “butter fly like pea’s”—with no hyphen, but, at this time, Ruskin uses hyphens mainly to fill out and “justify” his lines, and not necessarily to signify word division. Thus, nothing disproves reading “butterfly” as one word. If read as two words, “butter fly” renders an already obscure passage into gibberish.
                5Two framed plates follow this text on p. 8, one a diagram of the constellation Charles’s Wain, and the second a house labeled “harry and lucys friends house.”
                Harry might have learned to regard Charles’s Wain as “an introduction to astronomy” from Joyce, Dialogues, which takes up the constellations starting from the second conversation on astronomy, and which supplies a diagram of Charles’s Wain that might well have served as the source of Ruskin’s drawing—both Joyce’s diagram and Ruskin’s drawing including not only Charles’s Wain but also the pole star and Arcturus. Joyce’s Tutor uses Charles’s Wain to orient his boys to the north pole star and other stars in the night sky and on the celestial globe. He also points to the many names of this constellation as indicating the arbitrariness of the sky’s mapping from ancient times  (Conversation 23, “Of the Fixed Stars,” 1:121-25; and pl. v, fig. 1).
                6See “Harry and Lucy,” vol. 1 (no. 3), e.g., chaps. 2, 8, and 9.
                7The frontispiece of this volume of “Harry and Lucy” (see part 2, MS III, “Description”) shows “harry going across the sea in a steamboat,” a drawing of a sidewheeler under full steam at sea and crowded with people.
                8The missing e is clearly visible in light pencil, Ruskin having failed to trace the letter in ink. This, along with pencil text visible beneath the ink throughout this “Harry and Lucy,” tells us that, at this time, Ruskin’s use of the pen was limited to tracing (see no. 12).
                9At the bottom of the page, “picture of the Bristol channel,” in which a three-master pulls a smaller boat by a rope, a steamboat approaches from the edge of the frame, and distant vessels are visible on the horizon.
                10This very common experiment appears in an early chapter on hydrostatics in Joyce, Dialogues, Conversation 2, “Of the Weight and Pressure of Fluids” (2:21-22); however, Ruskin’s language very closely—too closely for coincidence—matches the opening of Conversation 19 on hydrostatics, “Of the Diver’s Bell.” A description of the machine is given with embellishments from Erasmus Darwin’s poem The Botanical Garden, e.g., to the effect that “Britannia [shall] rule the wealthy realms, / Which Ocean’s wide, insatiate wave o’erwhelms” (2:115-19).
