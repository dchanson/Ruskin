                    but which also carried sails, as in the drawing. The first such vessel to be successful was <name type="vessel" corresp="#THECOMET">The Comet</name> (<date when="1812">1812</date>), 
                    which initially operated on the <geogName corresp="#CLYDERIVER">Clyde River</geogName> in <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>, ferrying between <placeName corresp="#GLASGOW">Glasgow</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#GREENOCK">Greenock</placeName>. 
                    <name corresp="#THECOMET">The Comet</name> then toured <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> in order to stir interest in steam voyaging, and it ended up in 1816 operating on the <geogName corresp="#FIRTHOFFORTH">Firth of Forth</geogName>. 
                        Its single tall funnel was sturdy enough to double as a mast (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BATCHELOR-CHANTSTEAMSHIPS"><persName corresp="#JBATCHELOR">Batchelor</persName> and <persName corresp="#CCHANT">Chant</persName>, <title type="book"><hi rend="italic">Complete Encyclpedia of Steamships</hi></title></ref>, 32&#x02013;33). 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s drawing does not show a sail attached to his steamboat&#x02019;s chimney,

                        he sailed by steam with his parents as early as age three (see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tours_of_1822-24">Tours of 1822&#x2013;24</ref>)&#x02014;would not necessarily 
                    have been aboard the famous <name corresp="#THECOMET">Comet</name>, since by the 1820s its success had inspired construction of dozens of steam passenger vessels.</p>
                    
                    <p>What <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <persName corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> means by crossing the &#x0201C;sea&#x0201D; is unclear. The phrase &#x0201C;across the sea&#x0201D;, if it reflects actual experience at all, 
                        could refer to crossing the <geogName corresp="#BRISTOLCHANNEL">Bristol Channel</geogName>. Ruskin&#x02BC;s drawing, <title type="artwork" corresp="#JRBRISTOLCHANNEL">&#x0201C;picture of the <geogName corresp="#BRISTOLCHANNEL">Bristol channel</geogName>&#x0201D;</title>,

                        depicts two steamboats among other craft, one close to the viewer and the other in the distance. 
                        The nearer vessel is chugging into (or out of) the scene, its smokestack parallel with the frame of the picture, 
                        seeming to impinge on a world of sail represented by a ship with three masts in full sail, which is towing a smaller craft. 
                        The Ruskin family could have boarded a sidewheeler steam packet in the course of their <geogName corresp="#WYE">Wye Valley</geogName> Wye Tour of 1827,

                        The first regular passenger service in this region was established between <placeName corresp="#CITYOFBATH">Bath </placeName>and <placeName corresp="#BRISTOL">Bristol</placeName> in 1813, 
                        and extended into the <geogName corresp="#BRISTOLCHANNEL">Bristol Channel</geogName> in 1822. By the end of the 1820s, several routes were established around the channel 
                        including a crossing from <placeName corresp="#BRISTOL">Bristol</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#CHEPSTOW">Chepstow</placeName> on the <geogName corresp="#WYERIVER">Wye River </geogName>

                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02019;s</persName> time, <placeName corresp="#SALTHILL">Salt Hill</placeName> was a village situated a mile west of <placeName corresp="#SLOUGH">Slough</placeName>, within the old borders of <placeName corresp="#BUCKINGHAMSHIRE">Buckinghamshire</placeName>. Known for its inns, 
                        the village was reached along the so-called <placeName corresp="#GRW">Bath Road</placeName> or <placeName corresp="#GRW">Great West Road</placeName> that led from <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#BRISTOL">Bristol</placeName>. 
                        For the young traveller <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, the place featured poetic and scientific associations. 
                        The vicinity offered views of <orgName corresp="#ETON">Eton</orgName> and <placeName corresp="#WINDSORCAS">Windsor Castle</placeName> to the south, which brought to mind <persName corresp="#TGRAY">Thomas Gray's (1716-71)</persName>

                        &#x0201C;Ode on a Distant Prospect of <orgName corresp="#ETON">Eton College</orgName>&#x0201D;; and a Norman church, <placeName corresp="#STLAURENCE">St. Laurence</placeName>&#x02019;s, in the village of <placeName corresp="#UPTON">Upton</placeName>, was claimed as the original 
                        of Gray's church tower and churchyard inspiring &#x0201C;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&#x0201D;. 
                        Since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was studying astronomy at this time, he may also have remarked the house belonging to <persName corresp="#WHERSCHEL">Sir William Herschel (1738&#x02013;1822)</persName>, 
                        &#x0201C;in the garden of which his great telescope was set up; here most of his discoveries were made, including that of the planet Uranus&#x0201D;. 

                        At the time of an 1860 guidebook, &#x0201C;[t]he tube of the telescope alone remain[ed] on the spot&#x0201D;; at the time of the Ruskins' Tour of 1827,

                    <p>The name <placeName corresp="#SALTHILL">Salt Hill</placeName> also refers to a tumulus within the village, which was the site of a &#x0201C;singular custom celebrated at <orgName corresp="#ETON">Eton school</orgName>, every third year, 
                        on Whit Tuesday, under the name of the <hi rend="italic">Montem</hi>&#x0201D;. As described in a guidebook of the 1820s, a &#x0201C;procession is made to a tumulus, 
                        near the <placeName corresp="#GRW">Bath road</placeName>, which has acquired the name of <placeName corresp="#SALTHILL">Salt-hill</placeName>, by which also the neighbouring inns have long been known. 
                        The chief object of this <hi rend="italic">ceremony</hi>, which has of late years been conducted with more decorum than formerly, 
                        is to collect money for <hi rend="italic">salt</hi>, as the phrase is, from all persons travelling on the road. 
                        The scholars who collect the money are called <hi rend="italic">salt-bearers</hi>, and are dressed in rich silk habits. 
                        'Tickets, inscribed with some motto, by way of password, are given to such persons as have already paid for <hi rend="italic">salt</hi>, 
                        as a security from any further demands. The procession has been frequently honoured with the presence of his Majesty and the royal family, 
                        whose liberal contributions, added to those of many of the nobility and others, who have been educated at <orgName corresp="#ETON">Eton</orgName>, 
                        and purposely attend the meeting, have so far augmented the collection, that it has been known to amount to more than 800&#x00A3;. 

                        The sum so collected is given to the senior-scholar, who is going off to <placeName corresp="#CAMBRIDGE">Cambridge</placeName>, for his support at the university"

                        an illustrated collection of &#x0201C;picturesque views&#x0201D; drawn, engraved, and probably written by

                        On passing over the Bridge, and proceeding up High Street, the fronts of several colleges, churches, and private dwellings are gradually and successively unfolded to the sight. 
                        The street is broad and long,--it has a gentle bend, or curve, along its whole extent. 
                        At every step the passenger is struck with new objects and fine combinations; 
                        and what with the tower of Caerfax, &#x0026;c. completing the vista at the extremity of the above side-scenery, 

                        on both hands,--the whole 'forms a street-scene of unrivalled variety and beauty'". The entrance from the south, &#x0201C;though not so grand&#x0201D;, 
                        led &#x0201C;from meadows, over three or four bridges", to Ruskin's future college--&#x0201D;the noble towers and turrets of <placeName corresp="#CHRISTCHURCHCOLLEGE">Christ Church</placeName>, with its stately avenue of elms"

                5Two framed plates follow this text on p. 8, one a diagram of the constellation Charles’s Wain, and the second a house labeled “harry and lucys friends house.”
                Harry might have learned to regard Charles’s Wain as “an introduction to astronomy” from Joyce, Dialogues, which takes up the constellations starting from the second conversation on astronomy, and which supplies a diagram of Charles’s Wain that might well have served as the source of Ruskin’s drawing—both Joyce’s diagram and Ruskin’s drawing including not only Charles’s Wain but also the pole star and Arcturus. Joyce’s Tutor uses Charles’s Wain to orient his boys to the north pole star and other stars in the night sky and on the celestial globe. He also points to the many names of this constellation as indicating the arbitrariness of the sky’s mapping from ancient times  (Conversation 23, “Of the Fixed Stars,” 1:121-25; and pl. v, fig. 1).
                6See “Harry and Lucy,” vol. 1 (no. 3), e.g., chaps. 2, 8, and 9.
                7The frontispiece of this volume of “Harry and Lucy” (see part 2, MS III, “Description”) shows “harry going across the sea in a steamboat,” a drawing of a sidewheeler under full steam at sea and crowded with people.
                8The missing e is clearly visible in light pencil, Ruskin having failed to trace the letter in ink. This, along with pencil text visible beneath the ink throughout this “Harry and Lucy,” tells us that, at this time, Ruskin’s use of the pen was limited to tracing (see no. 12).
                9At the bottom of the page, “picture of the Bristol channel,” in which a three-master pulls a smaller boat by a rope, a steamboat approaches from the edge of the frame, and distant vessels are visible on the horizon.
                10This very common experiment appears in an early chapter on hydrostatics in Joyce, Dialogues, Conversation 2, “Of the Weight and Pressure of Fluids” (2:21-22); however, Ruskin’s language very closely—too closely for coincidence—matches the opening of Conversation 19 on hydrostatics, “Of the Diver’s Bell.” A description of the machine is given with embellishments from Erasmus Darwin’s poem The Botanical Garden, e.g., to the effect that “Britannia [shall] rule the wealthy realms, / Which Ocean’s wide, insatiate wave o’erwhelms” (2:115-19).
