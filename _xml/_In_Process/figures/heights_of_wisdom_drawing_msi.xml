                    <p>The emblematic drawing was perhaps inspired by a passage in Harry and Lucy Concluded (1825) by Maria Edgeworth: 
                        only "those who are themselves children, or . . . those who know children right well" will credit 
                        Harry and Lucy's "sudden falls from the heights of wisdom to the depths of folly". The protagonists 
                        have been engaged in well-regulated learning: Harry has been teaching Lucy the mechanics of air pumps, 
                        using a pump made of glass in order to exhibit its inner workings. "How did Harry and Lucy spend 
                        the remainder of this morning, two whole hours?" the narrator asks. They spoil the glass pump by 
                        setting it to work in a muddy puddle, and they soil their clothing so badly that they are forced 
                        to hide in a tree to avoid their mother's summons to greet unexpected visitors. To their consternation, 
                        their shame and bashfulness cost them an interesting account of a shipwreck, which the visitors related. 
                        Harry and Lucy beg their mother to repeat the story, but she refuses lest they lose this motivation to overcome 
                        their follies of bashfulness and carelessness with their things (1:103, and see 103-14).</p>
                    
                    <p>Assuming that the source is correctly identified, Ruskin can be seen translating a didactic narrative into an emblematic picture 
                        by dispensing with the narrative details and fixing on the simple pictorial contrast of "heights of wisdom" and 
                        "depths of folly". Ruskin's edition of Harry and Lucy Concluded was not illustrated (see 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="boyhood_books_note.php#DESCRIPTIONS">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Physical Descriptions</ref>); 
                        however, emblems were familiar to him from illustrations in other children's books, such as 
                        <title type="anthology" corresp="#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALES"><hi rend="italic">Christmas Tales</hi></title> by 
                        <persName type="fictional" corresp="#SOBERSIDES">Solomon Sobersides</persName>. 
                        Its frontispiece represents Wisdom and Folly competing to lead the steps of youth, as explained by an accompanying text: 
                        "See here the Youth, by Wisdom led, / The Paths of Life, securely tread; / The dang'rous Lures of Folly shun, / 
                        And Virtue's Course serenely run."</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The emblems in this woodcut are unpacked in an essay introducing the copy of 
                                        <title type="anthology" corresp="#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALES"><hi rend="italic">Christmas Tales</hi></title> held by the Hockliffe Collection: 
                        "A masterpiece of its kind", the engraving shows "Wisdom (looking rather like Britannia) giving a book to a young boy, 
                        while Folly (distinguished by her fool's hat) tries to distract him with a rattle. Behind them, we see the solid and magnificent temple 
                        built by Wisdom, and the ruined temple which must be the result of heeding the 'Lures of Folly'" 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALESHOCKLIFFE"><title type="archive" corresp="#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALESHOCKLIFFE">&#x201C;Hockliffe Project: Stories before 1850--0220: Anon. [&#x2018;Solomon Sobersides&#x2019;], Christmas Tales&#x201D;</title></ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p>The emblems in the frontispiece are derived from traditional sources, such as those found in Caesar Ripa's Iconologia, 
                        but they have been adapted to a child's text. The youth is put in the place of the classical hero, Hercules, 
                        who according to an fable parable must choose between virtue and vice. An example of an adaptation in neoclassical art is 
                        <title type="artwork" corresp="#BATONIHERCULES"><hi rend="italic">Hercules at the Crossroads</hi></title> (1748) 
                        by Pompeo Girolamo Batoni, in which Hercules weighs the alternatives offered on the one hand by Venus and on the other 
                        by the armored figure of Minerva, who points to the Temple of Fame on a hill. In one of Ruskin's favorite boyhood books, 
                        Evenings at Home, he would have encountered a version adapted for girls, 
                        <title type="story" corresp="#BARBAULDFEMALECHOICE">"The Female Choice: A Tale"</title> in which the heroine is divided 
                        between the appeals of Dissipation and Housewifery 
                        (Barbauld and Aiken, Evenings at Home, 3:160-65). Another boyhood book filled with emblems was of course 
                        Pilgrim's Progress by John Bunyan.</p>
                                    
                    <p>As the final item in MS I, Ruskin's emblem seems to complement the 
                        <ref type="witness" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_msi.php#FRONTISPIECE"><title type="artwork" corresp="#JRFRONTISPIECEMSI">"frontispiece</title></ref> 
                        of his own "Harry and Lucy Concluded . . . vol I" at the beginning of the Red Book. 
                        The shape of the deep ravine is an inversion of the oddly triangular shape labled "a rainbow" in the frontispiece.</p>
