                    <p>The emblematic drawing was perhaps inspired by a passage in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><title type="lesson" corresp="#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><hi rend="italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</hi></title></ref> (<date when="1825">1825</date>) by <persName corresp="#ME">Maria Edgeworth</persName>: 
                        only &#x201c;those who are themselves children, or . . . those who know children right well&#x201d; will credit 
                        <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName>&#x02bc;s &#x201c;sudden falls from the heights of wisdom to the depths of folly&#x201d;. The protagonists 
                        have been engaged in well&#x2010;regulated learning: <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> has been teaching <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> the mechanics of air pumps, 
                        using a pump made of glass in order to exhibit its inner workings. &#x201c;How did <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> spend 
                        the remainder of this morning, two whole hours?&#x201d; the narrator asks. They spoil the glass pump by 
                        setting it to work in a muddy puddle, and they soil their clothing so badly that they are forced 
                        to hide in a tree to avoid their <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MAMMAME">mother</persName>&#x02bc;s summons to greet unexpected visitors. To their consternation, 
                        their shame and bashfulness cost them an interesting account of a shipwreck, which the visitors related. 
                        <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> beg their <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MAMMAME">mother</persName> to repeat the story, but she refuses lest they lose this motivation to overcome 
                        their follies of bashfulness and carelessness with their things (1:103, and see 103&#x2013;14).</p>
                    
                    <p>Assuming that the source is correctly identified, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> can be seen translating a didactic narrative into an emblematic picture 
                        by dispensing with the narrative details and fixing on the simple pictorial contrast of &#x201c;heights of wisdom&#x201d; and 
                        &#x201c;depths of folly&#x201d;. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s edition of <title type="lesson" corresp="#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><hi rend="italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</hi></title> was not illustrated (see 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="boyhood_books_note.php#DESCRIPTIONS">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Physical Descriptions</ref>); 
                        however, emblems were familiar to him from illustrations in other children&#x02bc;s books, such as 
                        <title type="anthology" corresp="#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALES"><hi rend="italic">Christmas Tales</hi></title> by 
                        <persName type="fictional" corresp="#SOBERSIDES">Solomon Sobersides</persName>. 
                        Its frontispiece represents Wisdom and Folly competing to lead the steps of youth, as explained by an accompanying text: 
                        &#x201c;See here the Youth, by Wisdom led, / The Paths of Life, securely tread; / The dang&#x02bc;rous Lures of Folly shun, / 
                        And Virtue&#x02bc;s Course serenely run.&#x201d;</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The emblems in this woodcut are unpacked in an essay introducing the copy of 
                                        <title type="anthology" corresp="#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALES"><hi rend="italic">Christmas Tales</hi></title> held by the Hockliffe Collection: 
                        &#x201c;A masterpiece of its kind&#x201d;, the engraving shows &#x201c;Wisdom (looking rather like Britannia) giving a book to a young boy, 
                        while Folly (distinguished by her fool&#x02bc;s hat) tries to distract him with a rattle. Behind them, we see the solid and magnificent temple 
                        built by Wisdom, and the ruined temple which must be the result of heeding the &#x2018;Lures of Folly&#x2019;&#x201d;

                    <p>The emblems in the frontispiece are derived from traditional sources, such as those found in <!--sp?

                        but they have been adapted to a child&#x02bc;s text. The youth is put in the place of the classical hero, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HERCULES">Hercules</persName>, 
                        who according to an fable parable must choose between virtue and vice. An example of an adaptation in neoclassical art is

                        by <persName corresp="#PGBATONI">Pompeo Girolamo Batoni</persName>, in which <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HERCULES">Hercules</persName> weighs the alternatives offered on the one hand by <persName type="fictional" corresp="#VENUS">Venus</persName> and on the other 
                        by the armored figure of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MINERVA">Minerva</persName>, who points to the <!--real place? Place in mythology?

                        <title type="lesson" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title>, he would have encountered a version adapted for girls,
