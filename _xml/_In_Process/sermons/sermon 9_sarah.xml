                    <lb/>Ye have seen, that I have talked with 
                    <lb/>you, from heaven&#x201D;.  Every mind that
                    <lb/>thinks rightly of the character of the
                    <lb/>law, and of the attributes of the <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>
                    <lb/>who gave it, must be aware, that,
                    <lb/>in considering the circumstances at
                    <lb/>tendant upon the its delivery on the
                    <lb/><geogName corresp="#SINAI">Mont Sinai</geogName>, and the general princi
                    <lb/>ples upon which it is founded, we
                    <lb/>are approaching a subject of the very
                    <lb/>highest importance.  As erroneous
                    <lb/>opinion has sometimes been enter&#x2010;
                    <lb/>tained, that the <title type="scripture" corresp="#GOSPEL">Gospel</title> requires no&#x2010;
                    <lb/>thing more to exempt us from the 
                    <lb/>punishment attendant upon the 
                    <lb/>violation of the law, than submis&#x2010;
                    <lb/>sion to its ordinances, and acknow&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ledgement of its truth, and indeed, 
                    <lb/>it would at first appear, that the 
                    <lb/>greatness of <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName>s merits, and the per
                    <lb/>fection of his atonement, are very
                    <lb/>much exalted by this view of the 
                    <lb/>subject.  But, we may be sure, that 
                    <lb/>all homage is rejected, which confin
                    <lb/>es the fulfilment of the law to a mere
                    <lb/>trust in the merits of the blood of 
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName>, We shall, at present place 
                    <lb/>the <title type="scripture" corresp="#GOSPEL">Gospel</title> subordinately, for the law
                    <lb/>was the first, and the highest consid
                    <lb/>eration, and that is to be exalted.</p>
                    <lb/><p>In the next place, let us see how far
                    <lb/>this view of the immense impor&#x2010;
                    <lb/>tance of the law, is supported by the
                    <lb/>circumstances of its delivery, for much
                    <lb/>useful information may always be 
                    <lb/>gathered from a examination of 
                    <lb/>particulars, which at the first glance,
                    <lb/>appear but of little consequence.  The 
                    <lb/>children of <persName corresp="#ISRAEL">Israel</persName>, a multitude whose 
                    <lb/>number cannot be reckoned less, 
                    <lb/>than three millions, had, it should
                    <lb/>be remembered, but just escaped from
                    <lb/>a humiliating state of slavery, cor
                    <lb/>ruption, and Idolatry; They were 
                    <lb/>shut out and separated from the 
                    <lb/>whole world, by the desert ,and the 
                    <lb/>sea, and in this solitude, they were 
                    <lb/>left to commune visible with God 
                    <lb/>and we find that <persName corresp="#GOD">the Deity</persName> did 
                    <lb/>not come to dwell among his people 
                    <lb/>until he had laid down the law, 
                    <lb/>which was, to be their principle of
                    <pb facs="MS Sermon 002a"/>
                    <lb/>action, in a manner, which should
                    <lb/>give importance both to the law its&#x2010;
                    <lb/>elf, and to his servant <persName corresp="#MOSES">Moses</persName>. who 
                    <lb/>was a mediator between <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> and the 
                    <lb/>Israelites.  We find the <persName corresp="#GOD">Lord</persName> descen
                    <lb/>ding upon <geogName corresp="#SINAI">Mount Sinai</geogName>, in fire to deli
                    <lb/>ver his commandments, to this <!--???-->
                    <lb/>ing assembly, We are told that <geogName corresp="#SINAI">Mont Sinai</geogName><!--Sinai on next line-->
                    <lb/>was altogether on a smoke, and 
                    <lb/>there were thunderings and lightenings
                    <lb/>and the whole mount quaked greatly
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#MOSES">Moses</persName> himself said that he ex
                    <lb/>ceedingly feared, Nature was entire&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ly overwhelmed by this wonderful
                    <lb/>manifestation of the power of the 
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> of glory The invisibility of the 
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#GOD">Almighty</persName><!--'Al' on previous line--> added to the mysterious ter
                    <lb/>ror and grandeur of his descent
                    <lb/>And can we suppose, that this 
                    <lb/>was an introduction to anything 
                    <lb/>of little moment, We must rather 
                    <lb/>suppose, that something of the great
                    <lb/>est importance was connected with
                    <lb/>it, For when preparation is made 
                    <lb/>in heaven, we may be sure, that
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> intends to show something wor
                    <lb/>thy of the observation of men, and
                    <lb/>of angels,  This is one of the very
                    <lb/>grandest scenes that ever were
                    <lb/>witnessed upon the earth or recor&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ded in history, and, as such, we can
                    <lb/>not expect that the subject which
                    <lb/>it introduces, should likewise have
                    <lb/>its grandeur consisting in outward
                    <lb/>appearances,  For nature had alread
                    <lb/>y done all that she could, she had
                    <lb/>called together all her wonders, all her
                    <lb/>terrors, all her majesty and its 
                    <lb/>was impossible for her to have gone
                    <lb/>beyond what she had already ac&#x2010;
                    <lb/>complished, and we therefore do
                    <lb/>not expect any thing of outward
                    <lb/>visible grandeur, the subject then
                    <lb/>to be introduced, must excel in
                    <lb/>its moral worth which is infinitely
                    <lb/>more impressive than any thing that
                    <lb/>the mere concentrated phenomena of 
                    <lb/>nature can show, or do.  <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> has al
                    <lb/>ready, gathered together his thun&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ders and his lightnings he has ar
                    <lb/>rayed himself in clouds and fire,
                    <lb/>he has caused the earth to quake from
                    <lb/>its foundations, and has shaken the
                    <lb/>stoutest heart of <persName corresp="#ISRAEL">Israel</persName>.  He then goes
                    <lb/>into the other department, and brings
                    <pb facs="MS Sermon 002a"/>
                    <lb/>forward the world of morals,  It is
                    <lb/>not my object at present to enter
                    <lb/>into all the details of the law which was
                    <lb/>introduced in such an awful manner
                    <lb/>but rather to observe the general prin&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ciple, the extent of its application, and the
                    <lb/>manner of its fulfilment.</p>
                    <lb/><p>First, the law was intended to be
                    <lb/>of universal extent, and to promote
                    <lb/>honesty, and purity of society among
                    <lb/>creatures and supreme attachment
                    <lb/>to the <persName corresp="#GOD">Creator</persName>.  For there is no being
                    <lb/>that has been formed for insula&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ted existence,  We find in all the
                    <lb/>desire to escape from solitude, and
                    <lb/>to enter into the social, pure, and hon
                    <lb/>est intercourse for which we were
                    <lb/>made. for impurity tends to debase
                    <lb/>ment, and dishonesty to ruin.  Soc
                    <lb/>iety would be the cause of its own an
                    <lb/>nihilation, if it were impure.  No
                    <lb/>shepherd was ever placed over placed
                    <lb/>over flocks, who was unable to guide
                    <lb/>and protect them, no judge was e
                    <lb/>ver placed upon the bench, who was
                    <lb/>not endued with powers to justice
                    <lb/>impartially although he might pun
                    <lb/>ish unwillingly, no sovereign has
                    <lb/>ever attained to the throne, who
                    <lb/>might not have been the protec
                    <lb/>tor, the governor, the Father of his
                    <lb/>people; I do not say these facul
                    <lb/>ties have never been abused, I on
                    <lb/>ly say that The <persName corresp="#GOD">Almighty</persName> has al&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ways given them, in order to pro.
                    <lb/>mote this pure, and honest society,?
                    <lb/>But let us go still higher.  The an
                    <lb/>gels have these faculties, and in a
                    <lb/>much greater degree  They also are 
                    <lb/>often set over us. and<!--'s' written over 'n' and 'd' crossed out--> governors and 
                    <lb/>protectors,  He shall give his angels
                    <lb/>charge governing thee<!--'e' written over 'y'--> lest at any time
                    <lb/>thou dash thy foot against a stone.
                    <lb/>They therefore, it is evident, must
                    <lb/>have the same faculties. We are told
                    <lb/>that it is one of the objects of <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName>
                    <lb/>to unite all these angels, and prin
                    <lb/>cipalities, and powers,  This is another
                    <lb/>proof of this intention of the law. A
                    <lb/>gain we are to enter into an innum
                    <lb/>merable company of angels, there are 
                    <lb/>many other proofs which could be
                    <lb/>deduced from scripture, and all show
                    <lb/>ing that the principalities of the law
                    <pb facs="MS Sermon 003a"/>
                    <lb/>are all intended to purify this fellow&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ship,  The injunction to which the whole
                    <lb/>law was reduced by <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName> is another
                    <lb/>confirmation of the same opinion Thou 
                    <lb/>shalt love the <persName corresp="#GOD">Lord</persName> thy <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> with all
                    <lb/>thy heart, and soul, and strength, &#x0026;
                    <lb/>thy neighbor as thyself.  But I shall
                    <lb/>say that this same law is binding. e
                    <lb/>ven upon the fallen angels, I say that
                    <lb/>it is also binding upon the fallen an
                    <lb/>gels, it is binding though it may not
                    <lb/>be obeyed, and this, and this only is
                    <lb/>the course of the eternality of punishment
                    <lb/>because their refusal to obey this uni&#x2010;
                    <lb/>versal law is a principle coeval with
                    <lb/>their existence, with their immortality
                    <lb/>of existence, and the punishment must
                    <lb/>be coeval with their existence also.  For,
                    <lb/>among those who have passed into a 
                    <lb/>state where probation is at an end, in
                    <lb/>iniquity, there never can be a prin
                    <lb/>ciple of pure and honest fellowship
                    <lb/>they must continue there, in the
                    <lb/>same state in which they had been
                    <lb/>while upon the earth, Every thing must
                    <lb/>cling to them, their sins and iniquity
                    <lb/>must be augmented tenfold.  There ne&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ver can be a principle of good fel&#x2010;
                    <lb/>lowship here, and therefore the pun
                    <lb/>ishment must correspondingly be everlasting.</p>
                    <lb/><p>But also this law, as well as uni
                    <lb/>versally binding, is eternally bind&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ing.  I repeat, that there are none
                    <lb/>exempted from obedience to it, and
                    <lb/>that obedience throughout all eter&#x2010;
                    <lb/>nity although there nevertheless, may
                    <lb/>be many who do not obey.  There
                    <lb/>can be no period of impurity in hea
                    <lb/>ven.  For in order to an eternity of
                    <lb/><del rend="strikethrough">an</del> happiness, there must be an e&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ternity of this pure and honest obed&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ience.  It is useless to imagine that
                    <lb/>happiness would be given by a mere
                    <lb/>change into another situation, remain&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ing there under the same circumstanc
                    <lb/>es.  It is true. that in this life, a mon
                    <lb/>otonous succession of the same objects, and
                    <lb/>ideas would produce lassitude in the
                    <lb/>mind, and fatigue to the body  This is
                    <lb/>our every day experience, and we find
                    <lb/>likewise that a change will always, stir
                    <lb/>us <del rend="strikethrough">?</del>up into action, it will give a new
                    <lb/>spring to the nerves, and call up all
                    <lb/>the energies of the mind  But this sort
                    <lb/>of excitement it should be remembered
                    <lb/>can only exist for a limited period, with
                    <lb/>a continual succession of changes, its
                    <pb facs="MS Sermon 003a"/>
                    <lb/>very nature is sufficient confirmation
                    <lb/>of this, and it therefore is not a mere
                    <lb/>change from one state to another, or one
                    <lb/>situation to another, still retaining our
                    <lb/>native depravity, that can, or will, con&#x2010;
                    <lb/>stitute the happiness of heaven. No, there
                    <lb/>must not only be a new scene, but also
                    <lb/>a new eye to behold it, there must not
                    <lb/>only be new pleasure, but new power 
                    <lb/>of enjoyment. a power which must
                    <lb/>be eternal, that is, eternal purity, is
                    <lb/>what must constitute the everlasting
                    <lb/>happiness of heaven.  And this is suff
                    <lb/>icient proof, I think, that the law is
                    <lb/>constantly binding, inasmuch as we
                    <lb/>cannot enjoy such happiness as we
                    <lb/>are told we shall enjoy, without a con
                    <lb/>stant obedience to it.</p>
                    <lb/><p>Again, I think the perpetuity of the
                    <lb/>obligation must appear, if we only
                    <lb/>consider the character of <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> the law
                    <lb/>giver.  For men, continually change
                    <lb/>Those who legislate on earth, even the
                    <lb/>wisest of them cannot foresee every
                    <lb/>thing, nor even imagine every ac&#x2010;
                    <lb/>cidental circumstance, which might
                    <lb/>at some future period, render an
                    <lb/>alteration necessary even of the best
                    <lb/>laws of men and, even if they could
                    <lb/>do this, they are also limited in power
                    <lb/>and if they could make such laws, have
                    <lb/>not always power or opportunity to en
                    <lb/>force them. even through a limited
                    <lb/>period, much less to everlasting. But
                    <lb/>if we take the law of <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> in connec&#x2010;

                    <lb/>knows all the different combination of

                    <lb/>suppose any event which he would not
                    <lb/>know, and besides all this, his wisdom
                    <lb/>also is unerring, he knows how to do
                    <lb/>every thing, as well as what is to be

                    <lb/>or how to bring good out of, all evil,

                    <lb/>the formation of an atom out of nothing
                    <lb/>is sufficient proof of this.  There was
                    <lb/>never any man furnished with all
                    <lb/>the advantages that earthly wisdom, pow

                    <lb/><p>Having thus ascertained these two

                    <lb/>and it is eternally binding; the fact
                    <lb/>which now remains to be considered,
                    <lb/>is, that this law has been violated by

                    <lb/>tion, we know that this is a fact, by
                    <lb/>our own daily experience and this is
                    <lb/>is a most tenfoldly appalling thought
                    <lb/>We have violated that law which is
                    <lb/>binding upon angels, and upon men,
                    <lb/>which is binding throughout all eter

                    <lb/>upon those who have fallen through
                    <lb/>their weakness, from their high es&#x2010;
                    <lb/>state.  We have sinned against the <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>
                    <lb/>who gave it among the thunders of
                    <lb/><geogName corresp="#SINAI">Mount Sinai</geogName> That <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> who made the

                    <lb/>our worldly mindedness; We think 
                    <lb/>it a most wonderful thing, that <persName corresp="#ISRAEL">Israel</persName><!--'el' on next line-->
                    <lb/>, after having witnessed the descent of

                    <lb/>of that descent, which made them fear
                    <lb/>to such a degree that they prayed,
                    <lb/>that <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> might not speak with
                    <pb facs="MS Sermon 004a"/>
                    <lb/>them lest they should die, we think
                    <lb/>it most astonishing, that after all this, they
                    <lb/>should so soon have again polluted 
                    <lb/>themselves with Idols, and worshipped the 
                    <lb/>golden calf, &#x0026;c. and so it was, but yet
                    <lb/>when we condemn them, we are ourselv
                    <lb/>es involved in the same judgement.  We
                    <lb/>here find the law clothed in all its ma
                    <lb/>jesty, we told that it was delivered by
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> on the <geogName corresp="#SINAI">Mount Sinai</geogName>, The truth of
                    <lb/>the record which tells us so, cannot be
                    <lb/>disputed, and we do not dispute it.  If
                    <lb/>therefore we violate it, the violation is
                    <lb/>equally culpable in us as it was in the 
                    <lb/>Israelites.  But we have violated it
                    <lb/>At this moment precisely, the same de
                    <lb/>viations are found in us, which were be

                    <lb/>period in a disjointed and ignorant

                    <lb/>yet entirely convinced of the weak
                    <lb/>ness of their own Gods.  Considering
                    <lb/>all these circumstances, and remem

                    <lb/>think be found enough to convict us
                    <lb/>We may take each individual separ
                    <lb/>ately, and ask how far his selfishness
                    <lb/>or his worldly mindedness, may have
                    <lb/>offended the principles of the law, and
                    <lb/> made him subject to the punish&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ment denounced by the law.  Cert

                    <lb/>&#x003D;ow such candid examination, and 
                    <lb/>the individual will find himself whol&#x2010;

                    <lb/><p>Lastly.  What is the result of our

                    <lb/>cannot indulge ourselves with the hope
                    <lb/> that we shall be forgiven.  The majes

                    <lb/>waiting and seeking for us.  We cannot
