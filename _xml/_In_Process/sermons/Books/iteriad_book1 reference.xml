                    <l>That we entered our carriage and rattled away</l>
                    <l>The road it was hilly and long long it seemed</l>
                    <l>As one hill being pas still one more intervened</l>

                    <l>The hill we were slowly most slowly descending</l>

                    <l>Until we were plunged as we turned to the right</l>
                    <l>In a wood that obscured the scene from our sight</l>

                    <l>Which for ages and centuries past may have stood</l>
                    <l>Upon oaks with their mossy trunks gnarled and knotted</l>
                    <l>Which still are magestic decayed through and rotted</l>
                    <l>Wile their far spreading branches obscuring the day</l>
                    <l>From the green wooded glades and the birches so grey</l>
                    <l>So fair was the wood on which now we did gaze</l>
                    <l>Admiring the flow&#x02BC;ry moss&#x2010;carpeted maze <!--hypen[CODE THE HYPHEN IN?]--></l>
                    <l>And there a small streamlet with verdant banks sung</l>
                    <l>At it laughingly sported the green sward among</l>
                    <l>And now as we gladly emerged from the shade</l>
                    <l>The place of our halting at length we surveyed</l>
                    <l>We drove to the door and the bell it was rung</l>
                    <l>And forth from the carriage impatient we sprun</l>
                    <l>Our apartment was shown to the window we flew</l>
                    <l>But oh what a prospect awaited our view</l>
                    <l>We saw on the opposite side of the road</l>
                    <pb facs="MSVIIp2-3"/>
                    <l>That four lofty poplars shyscrappingly stood</l>
                    <l>While festooning and twining their foliage among</l>
                    <l>The rig so gracefully gracefully garlanding clung</l>
                    <l>They stood on a bank which the crystalline wave</l>
                    <l>Of the woodshirted <geogName corresp="#WINDERMERE">Windermere</geogName> lightly did lave</l>
                    <l>So fresh and so cooling as angry it broke</l>
                    <l>On a pier that was formed of rough masses of rock</l>
                    <l>Two barks the wave breasted but moored by a chain</l>
                    <l>In vain that wave boor them they struggled in vain</l>
                    <l>Then wandered the eye as deserting the shore</l>
                    <l>It roved the dark lake and its blue mountains oer</l>
                    <l>Where the huge pikes of <geogName corresp="#LANGDALE">Langdale</geogName> struck awe to the mind</l>
                    <l>With their dark and dread outlines distinctly defined</l>
                    <l>Where the pikes of <geogName corresp="#SCAWFELL">Scawfell</geogName> rose so haughty and proud</l>
                    <l>While its battlements lofty looked down on the cloud</l>
                    <l>While its sides with ravines and dark chasms were riven</l>
                    <l>That huge mountain wall seemed upholding the heaven</l>
                    <l>And now with our appetites sharpened and able</l>
                    <l>We turned to the dinner which smoked on the table</l>
                    <l>Indeed I am wrong I the truth have not told</l>
                    <l>For if I mistake not that dinner was cold</l>
                    <l>Then forth we did spring for we found it so nice</l>
                    <l>That the business of eating was done in a thrice</l>
                    <l>We sprang to the beach there to laugh and to play</l>
                    <l>And to watch the wild waves and the scene to survey</l>
                    <l>First forth we did run to the end of the pier</l>
                    <l>And there the light wave was so limpid and clear</l>
                    <l>You might almost have thought that no wave intervened</l>
                    <l>So pure and so bright and so airy it seemed</l>
                    <l>We gazed when the shoals of the minnows did glide</l>
                    <l>For a casual moment exposing their side</l>
                    <l>Oh then how they flashed they seemed lightings at play</l>
                    <l>Desporting themselves neath the watery way</l>
                    <l>And while for a moment the lustrous waves trembled</l>
                    <l>Flint and steel at a boxing match much they resembled</l>
                    <l>But now we were summoned away by a call</l>
                    <l>In order to visit a fine waterfall</l>
                    <l>At the banks of the lake we no longer delayed</l> 
                    <l>But in great expectation we joyful obeyed</l>
                    <l>How teeming with beauty how fair was that road</l> 
                    <l>As it wound round the hill all adorned with wood</l>
                    <l>Here neath the thick moss the wood violets grew</l>

                    <l>And their rich breeze borne fragrance around them they thew</l>
                    <l>And there the red strawberry hung oer the spring</l>
                    <l>And round the old oaks the dark ivy did cling</l>
                    <l>And the thrush and the lark and the robin so mild</l>
                    <l>Were warbling their notes in there wilderness wild</l>
                    <l>We listened the rapturous harmony came</l>
                    <l>And then was repeated again and again</l>
                    <l>While it was the only harmonious sound</l>
                    <l>That broke the still silence that reigned around</l>
                    <l>Save where oer the waters the breezes did play</l>
                    <l>And ruffled the murmuring waves of the bay</l>
                    <l>And now we arrived at the inn <placeName corresp="#SALUTATION">Salutation</placeName></l>
                    <l>Being quite at a loss for terms of administration</l>
                    <l>Then turned to the right and the hill gan ascending</l>
                    <l>Where the path amid copses of brushwood was bending</l>
                    <l>And wound up a narrow and wooded ravine</l>
                    <l> Which confined with rocks the bright waves of a stream</l>
                    <l>The path it was stony and toilsome the way</l>
                    <l>But still perseoerance shall carry the day</l>
                    <l>While their from the bowels the heart of the rock</l>
                    <l>First forth to the daylight a rivulet broke</l>
                    <l>Then twinkling and dancing all over the road</l>
                    <l>Found its way to the torrent beneath us which it flowed</l>
                    <l>While some mass of rock some convenient stone</l>
                    <l>By way of a bridge in the streamlet was thrown</l>
                    <l>But it looked so ticklish so very suspicious</l>
                    <l>As if it intended to completely to dish us</l>
                    <l>To alleviate our heat by a ducking and by</l>
                    <l>A draught of the fountain our thirst t&#x02BC; satisfy</l>
                    <l>Though much we admire them yet just at this time</l>
                    <l>Such rock admiration we begged to decline</l>
                    <l>And hoped theg&#x02BC;d excuse that our great veneration</l> 
                    <l>We did not then shew by a humble prostration</l>
                    <l>And now we had climbed where a beetling brow'd rock</l>
                    <l>Hung sheer where the waters in angry foam broke</l>
                    <l>We stopped to the edge- From the brink of the steep</l>
                    <l>Low sunk a wide chasm all dreary and deep</l>
                    <l>The mountain ash hung oer the dark torrents foam</l>
                    <l>And the old stunted oaks frowned all savage and lone</l>
                    <l>High in front rose a cliff oer whose mist covered brow</l>
                    <l>The fierce torrent dashed to the deep gulph below</l>
                    <l>Two streams from the rock where its head overhung</l>
                    <pb facs="MSVIIp6-7"/>
                    <l>In lines of bright silvery foaming they sprung</l>
                    <l>Then rushed gainst a crag where midway it stood</l>
                    <l>And opposed its dark sides to the force of the flood</l>
                    <l>United with back beaten force from it leapt</l>
                    <l>And indignantly down dashing dreadful it swept</l>
                    <l>All wreathed with snow and all chafed with by the rock</l>
                    <l>Twas received in the bason which yawned at its foot</l>
                    <l>Forth dancing so gaily the bright waters flowed</l>
                    <l>While the masses of foam on its surface yet rode</l>
                    <l>Then confused mid the stones all so lightly they danced</l> 
                    <l>And leaping and sporting they frothily glanced</l>
                    <l>And their murmurs were sounding full softly and lone</l>
                    <l>As mantling in basons of moss covered stone</l>
                    <l>And now when our sight we had well satisfied</l> 
                    <l>And had gazed enough on the fierce boiling tide</l>
                    <l>Tourds Lowood <placeName corresp="#LOW_WOOD">Lowood</placeName> once more we our foot steps did bend</l>
                    <l>And the rough mountain path we began to descend</l>
                    <l>Soon reached we the shore where a scene we descry</l>
                    <l>That baffles description and dazzles the eye</l>
                    <l>The sun eer his glory away should be past</l>
                    <l>On the brows of the mountains was shining his last</l>
                    <l>The bright western clouds their rough outlines unfold</l>
                    <l>Relieving their splendor and graven in gold</l>
                    <l>Methought little space tween those hills interirend</l> 
                    <l>But nearer more lofty more shaggy they seemed</l> 
                    <l>The clouds oer their summets they calmly did rest</l>
                    <l>And hung on the aethers invisible breast</l>
                    <l>Than the vapours of earth they seemed purer more bright</l>
                    <l>Oh could they be clouds  Twas the necklace of night</l>
                    <l>Then we looked on the lake where the deep crimson ray</l>
                    <l>Shot its light on the waters as bloody they play</l>
                    <l>It seemed as if autumn had given its tinge</l>
                    <l>To the woods which the lakes splendid ripples did fringe</l>
                    <l>And the islands on which that bright rippleing rolled</l>
                    <l>They seemed <!--looked written in penci--> as if lashed by the pure liquid gold</l>
                    <l>Oh such was the scene which glory reposed</l>
                    <l>But soon by the evening its splendour was closed</l>
                    <l>Ere we reached our home the dark shades of the night</l>
                    <l>Descending had hidden the hills from our sight</l>
                    <l>They died in the mists of the darkness away</l> 
                    <l>To be waked into light at the dawn of the day</l>
                    <l>And now being tired we soon hurried to bed</l>
                    <pb facs="MSVIIp8-9"/>
                    <l>And on the soft pillow we rested out head</l>
                    <l>Soon soon we were plunged in forgetfulness sweet</l>
                    <l>And gladly we sunk in th' <!--"e" crossed out and ' added in pencil-->oblivion of sleep</l>
                    <l>Which fluttered with <name type="fictional" corresp="#LETHE">Lethean</name> dews all around</l>
                    <l>And formed his grey wings with a soft lulling sound</l>
                    <l>He poured on our temples those rich dews of rest</l>
                    <l>And folded us round with his thought killing vest</l>
                    <l>And there as he hung on his wings he infused</l>
                    <l>His drawings of pleasure of pleasure confused</l>
                    <l>Thus thus on our pillow we carelessly lay</l>
                    <l>While the hours unperceived floated lightly away</l>
                    <l>To soon as the clouds of the heaven were borne</l>
                    <l>Away into distance at grey of the morn</l>
                    <l>We sprang to the shore  Now so calm was the lake</l>
                    <l>We thought that with pleasure a sail we might take</l>
                    <l>So calling the boatmen leaped into the boat</l>
                    <l>And with pulling and pushing we set her afloat</l>
                    <l>And deserting the pier then for fear of a souse</l>
                    <l>Sat down in the boat and were still as a mouse.</l>
                    <l>But our tongues neverceasing we did exercise</l>
                    <l>And also made very good use of our eyes</l>
                    <l>Of this place and that of the boatman enquiring</l>
                    <l>And the name of this mountain that island desiring</l> 
                    <l>The boatman  Oh he had a fine Roman phiz <!--Phiz???--></l>
                    <l>Strong muscular arms and rough red locks were his</l>
                    <l>To each question we asked his replying upon it</l>  
                    <l>Were so short and so pithy so very laconic</l>
                    <l>One I know (tis a pity that I have forgot em)</l>
                    <l>Can you swim? &#x201C;Like a stone sir not far to the bottom.&#x201D;</l>
                    <l>The number of th&#x02BC; islands on th&#x02BC; lake do you know?</l>
                    <l>&#x201C;Awell sir I think tis about so and so&#x201D;</l>
                    <l>However we all thought him and excellent creature </l>
                    <l>Because we all found him so full of good nature</l>
                    <l>And at present he pulled on our boat with a force</l>
                    <l>That sent it away like a shaft on its course</l>
                    <l>As it cut through the mirror or waters below</l>
                    <l>The ripples durded fly back from the bow</l>

                    <l>And partially ruffled the glass bosomed lake</l>

                    <l>Sprung confident forth on the dark heaving dep</l>

                    <l>While each woody headland seemed darting us by</l>
                    <l>Each rock and each island deserting its place</l> 
                    <l>With shore and with mountains seemed joining the race</l>
                    <l>Here some little pleasure&#x003D;boat spreading its sail</l>
                    <l>Was courting the breath (but in vain) of the gale</l>
                    <l>Still it remained unmoved by the shore</l>
                    <l>And lazily floated till urged by the oar</l>
                    <l>But now we bethought ourselves that a lake sail</l>
                    <l>To satisfy hunger completely would fail</l>
                    <l>And as baulked of our breakfast we&#x02BC;d look very queer</l>

                    <l>Yet breathing of heaven played soft through our hair</l>
                    <l>And health fresh infusing in every part</l>
                    <l>And bracing the limbs and en&#x2010;nerving the heart</l>
                    <l>When mountains on mountains succissively rise</l>
                    <l>When the eye at each pull some new beauty descries</l>
                    <l>When wee swift oer the waters for mile after mile</l>
                    <l>To think of our breakfast thou sayest was erile</l>

                    <l>You forget that its sharpness will hunger increase</l>
                    <l>Besides that our breakfast we hastened to seize on</l>
                    <l>There was a complete an efficient reason</l>

                    <l>Twas gallantly and sympathy hurried us home</l>
                    <l>Would you have a lady and muffins all hot too</l>
                    <l>All waiting and wondering where we had got to</l>
                    <l>If there wouldst I thee pity but reason no more</l>

                    <l>And now at the bottom the sand did appear</l>
                    <l>As our boats arching prow to the beach became near</l>
                    <l>Then stooping the boatman relinquished his oar</l>
                    <l>And catching a post drew us in to the shore</l>

                    <l>To take our farewell of that joybringing shore</l>

                    <l>Back back Why we might have into the lake</l>
                    <l>What should we say then to miss Fortune so fickle</l>

                    <l>But these accidents only existed in thought</l>
                    <l>For safely and soon to the inn we were brought</l>
                    <l>And now an excursion we thought we would make</l>
                    <l>A view of the lake and the valley to take</l>
                    <l>So inquiring the way to a small elevation</l>
                    <l>Whose summit we thought a most excellent station</l>
                    <l>We set off by a path mid the valley which wound</l>

                    <l>Till after some puzzling we came to the rock</l>
                    <l>And swiftly climbed up to the trees on its top</l>
                    <l>First we gazed where Helm crag <geogName corresp="#HELM_CRAG">Helm Crag</geogName>to the west of the vale</l>
                    <l>Reared its cloud splitting head and lowed down on the dale</l>
                    <l>While its dark shadow shaded the fields at its feet</l>
                    <l>Made the cornfields wave browner and darkened the deep</l>
                    <l>But the terrified eye now deserting its form</l>
