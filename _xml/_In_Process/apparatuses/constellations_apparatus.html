               <h2><span class="headingNumber">1.2. </span><span class="head">Title</span></h2>
               <p>In the earlier of two surviving fair copies of the poem (see <a class="link_ref" href="#MAJORMS" title="Manuscripts">Manuscripts</a>), <a class="link_ref" href="rft70_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">RF T70</span></a>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> centered <span class="titlem">“<span class="caps">THE CONSTELLATIONS</span>”</span> above the column of lines. Then, in what appears an afterthought, he added “<span class="caps">NORTHERN</span>” to the right in the margin, on the baseline of the main title; and on a second line
                  below “<span class="caps">NORTHERN</span>”, he placed, awkwardly, in the margin to the right of the opening lines of the poem,
                  “<span class="caps">SOME OF THE ZODIAC / AND SOME OF THE SOUTHERN</span>”.</p>
               <p>While the addition of the trailing lines to the first fair‐copy subtitle might be
                  explained as pacing <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs composition of the poem, this possibility is dismissed by the survival of a prior
                  draft. The belated additions could suggest, however, that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> came to understand the hemispheric positions of the constellations only after he
                  first drafted the poem. As discussed in <a class="link_ref" href="#STAGE" title="The Constellations as Marking a Stage of Astronomical Education">“The Constellations” as Marking a Stage of Astronomical Education</a>, this inference is probably too extreme—contradicted, for example, by his clustering,
                  more or less, of constellation groups within the poem, such as the northern circumpolar
                  constellations and the <span class="name">Zodiac</span> constellations. Nonetheless, the evolving title does testify to <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> as a marker of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs developing understanding and his desire to represent that development materially.
                  The revision to the title may have posed one motive for giving up on this fair‐copy
                  manuscript, <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, and using the same sheet to revise some of its lines (see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB" title="Composition and Publication">Composition and Publication</a>).</p>
               <p>In the second surviving fair copy, in <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III</span></a>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> incorporated his revisions to the first fair copy, including allowing space to center
                  the subtitle properly below the main title and above the first line, breaking the
                  three lines as <span class="titlem">“<span class="caps">THE CONSTELLATIONS / NORTHERN, SOME OF THE ZODIAC AND / SOME OF THE SOUTHERN</span>”</span>.</p>
               <p>The fragment of draft of the poem, bound in <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span></a>, lacks a title. Since the (unnumbered) lines in this manuscript start with line 27
                  as fair‐copied, presumably a sheet containing draft of preceding lines has been lost,
                  which may have included a title. The first state of the title, if any, is therefore
                  unknown, and we can only speculate about its relation to the apparent expansion of
                  the subtitle in the first fair copy. See <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php#COLLATION"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span>: Collation of the Original Bound Manuscript</a>.</p>

                  <p>An apparently fragmentary manuscript, <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem">“cepheus and bootes now”</span></span> is a 12.5 × 20 cm vertically folded sheet, written on all four sides in pencil, cursive
                     hand, with some substitutions written in ink, cursive hand. Although unsigned, and
                     the hand described as “unidentifed” in the finding aid of the <span class="titlem">Beinecke Library John Ruskin Collection</span>, the hand is distinctly <span class="persName">John Ruskin</span>ʼs early cursive.</p>
                  <p>The manuscript probably was bound into into <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> by <span class="persName">Cook</span> and <span class="persName">Wedderburn</span>. Like the other contents of this miscellaneous collection, this item was separated
                     from its binding, whether prior to or as a result of <span class="persName">Charles Goodspeed</span>ʼs house fire. See <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php#COLLATION"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span>: Collation of the Original Manuscript</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php#COLLATION"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span>: Contents, <span style="font-style:italic">b</span></a>. Presently, at the <span class="placeName">Beinecke Library</span>, the manuscript is catalogued as part of the <span class="titlem">John Ruskin Collection, Series II: Manuscripts</span>, <span class="date">1826–1897</span>, subseries Unbound Manuscripts, “<span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Monastery</span></span>—Manuscript, in an unidentified hand, of passages of verse, undated”. The folded sheet
                     of <span class="titlem">“Constellations”</span> draft has been collected together with a fragment of <span class="titlem">“Monastery”</span> draft, which resembles the former in its paper and pencil cursive hand, and the collection
                     misidentified as consisting solely of manuscript of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>.</p>

                  <h3><span class="headingNumber">1.4.2. </span><span class="head"><span class="titlem">RF T70</span></span></h3>
                  <p>A facsimile of a manuscript—the whereabouts of the original being unknown—this item
                     consists of two photographs, which document a vertically folded sheet containing a
                     fair copy of the poem in pen‐and‐ink print lettering in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs hand, along with revisions of the text in his cursive hand, both ink and pencil.
                     The first‐stage fair copy was annotated in pencil by <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span>. Possibly, the photographs were taken in the course of preparing the <a class="link_ref" href="library_edition_note.php"><span class="titlem">Library Edition</span></a>; if so, the facsimile was not cited or reproduced in the edition. The photographs
                     are held by <span class="orgName">The Ruskin</span> at <span class="orgName">Lancaster University</span>, catalogued as <a class="link_ref" href="rft70_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">RF T70</span></a>.</p>
                  <p>The folded sheet was photographed spread open and laid flat, with one photograph showing
                     pages 4 and 1 (from left to right), and the other photograph showing the reverse side,
                     pages 2 and 3 (from left to right). The manuscript reveals at least two major stages
                     of composition, a first stage of fair copying, and a second stage of heavy revision.
                     The fair copy occupies pages 1–2 (i.e., both sides of the first leaf), while the remaining
                     pages 3–4 (the second leaf) would originally have been left blank, prior to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs revisions. Subsequently, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> used this blank space, as well as the margins of pages 1–2, for revisions. Thus,
                     the facsimiles preserve a rare instance of a manuscript containing a fair copy of
                     an early work by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> that he subsequently revised using the same sheet.</p>

               <p><span class="persName">Cook</span> and <span class="persName">Wedderburn</span> ascribed the poem to <span class="date">1827</span>, and they cited as sources the <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span></a> and <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III</span></a> versions (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Works</span></span></a>, 2:535). No mention is made in the <a class="link_ref" href="library_edition_note.php"><span class="titlem">Library Edition</span></a> of the manuscript captured by the photographs, <a class="link_ref" href="rft70_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">RF T70</span></a>. Judging by what little the editors wrote about the poem, they based their dating
                  on an association of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> with a poem they declare to have been contemporaneous, <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span></a>, although they leave the nature of this association unexplained (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Works</span></span></a>, 2:260 n. 1). Their method was sound but their conclusion inexact.</p>
               <p>The physical basis for associating the two poems is the similarity of the fragments
                  of rough draft in a pencil, cursive hand—so similar that the two drafts were apparently
                  mistaken as belonging to the same work (see <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php#COLLATION"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span>: Collation of the Original Manuscript</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php#COLLATION"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span>: Contents, <span style="font-style:italic">b</span></a>). For the place of this draft in the chronological sequence of drafting, revising,
                  and fair‐copying <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB" title="Composition and Publication">Composition and Publication</a>. Here it suffices to explain that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs hand in these draft manuscripts, which is a sprawling cursive in pencil with occasional
                  substitutions in pen‐and‐ink cursive, cannot be earlier than his first use of pen
                  and ink in <span class="date">April 1827</span>; and that the compositional history of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> places its <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> draft fragment, which contains lines of book 2 of the poem, no earlier than <span class="date">August 1827</span> and possibly starting as late as <span class="date">November 1828</span>, following the familyʼs return to <span class="placeName">Herne Hill</span> from the <a class="link_ref" href="tours_of_1826-27_note.php"><span class="date">Tour of 1827</span></a> to <span class="placeName">Scotland</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-COMPARISON" title="Relation to Fair Copy of The Monastery">Relation to Draft of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span></a>; <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php#DATE"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>: Date</a>; and <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php#COMPPUB"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>: Composition and Publication</a>).</p>
               <p>As another physical feature besides the similarity of the <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> rough drafts linking <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> chronologically with the composition of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, the first fair copy of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> (<span class="titlem">RF T70</span>) shares orthographic eccentricities of punctuation with the fair copy of books 1–2
                  of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> (<span class="titlem">MS III</span>). For the first twenty lines of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, each line ends with punctuation, occasionally a colon or full‐stop period, but most
                  frequently a prominent comma formed to look like book print, with a dot and a curl.
                  After twenty lines of this observant punctuation, the marks abruptly stop. This pattern
                  is identical to the punctuation in the fair copy of book 1 and the first eighty lines
                  of book 2 of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, in which almost every line of verse ends with a punctuation mark until the punctuation
                  gives out altogether. The pattern suggests that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> may have added the punctuation to these poems all at once, layering the marks over
                  top of the already fair‐copied text, only to grow tired of the exercise and quit.
                  Thereafter, in the fair copies of both poems, only an occasional punctuation mark
                  internal to a verse line appears—a comma or an apostrophe, which is regularly spaced
                  along with the surrounding characters, indicating that the mark was inserted in the
                  course of fair‐copying. Moreover, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs penmanship for the punctuation is similar in the two poemsʼ fair copies, with the
                  marks at the ends of lines of verse tending to float above the baseline (see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-COMPARISON" title="Relation to Fair Copy of The Monastery">Relation to Fair Copy of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span></a>).</p>
               <p>These practices contrast markedly with the very sparse punctuation in the fragmentary
                  rough drafts of both <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> and <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> and with the fair‐copied poems comprising the anthology, <a class="link_ref" href="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“poetry discriptive”</span></a>. The poems in the latter collection exhibit, moreover, an awkward learnerʼs stage
                  of penmanship, including tracing in ink over top of characters formed initially with
                  pencil. These factors put distance between the <span class="date">1827</span> <span class="titlem">“poetry discriptive”</span> and the fair copies of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> and <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, which in the eccentricity of their punctuation resemble the usage in <a class="link_ref" href="eudosia_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Eudosia”</span></a> (<a class="link_ref" href="msiv_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS IV</span></a>), which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> dated <span class="date">28 September 1828</span> on its title page. While the significance of that date within the compositional history
                  of <span class="titlem">“Eudosia”</span> is obscure, the triangulation of that projectʼs punctuation practices with those
                  of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> and <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> appears to situate the latter two projects decisively in <span class="date">1828</span>.</p>
               <p>But when in <span class="date">1828</span>? If <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> based the first lines of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> on actual observation of the sky (or perhaps a demonstration at one of the so‐called
                  Lenten astronomy lectures [see <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note.php">Astronomical Education</a>), the alignment of planets and constellations described at the beginning of the poem
                  would have been observable in <span class="date">April–May 1828</span>, and not at all observable in <span class="date">1827</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="#REAL-LIFE" title="The Constellations as a Record of Actual Astronomical Observations">Discussion: “The Constellations” as a Record of Actual Astronomical Observations</a>). This approximate dating would place draft and first fair‐copying of both <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> and books 1–2 of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> in the <span class="date">first quarter of 1828</span>—between the <a class="link_ref" href="tours_of_1826-27_note.php"><span class="date">Tour of 1827</span></a>, which had been delayed until late in the year, and the <a class="link_ref" href="tour_of_1828">Tour of <span class="date">1828</span></a>, probably begun following <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="date">10 May</span> birthday but interrupted that same month by news of the death of <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span>ʼs sister, <a class="link_ref" href="richardson_jessie_note.php"><span class="persName">Jessie</span></a>.</p>
               <p>Fair‐copying, and possibly initial composition, during the first months of <span class="date">1828</span> accord well with the placement of the second fair copy of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> entered in <span class="titlem">MS III</span> as the first poem in the <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_poetry_anthology_2_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III Second Poetry Anthology</span></a>, immediately following <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”</span></a>. While fair‐copying of that anthology cannot be dated precisely, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> would not have waited long to make a fair copy incorporating the extensive revisions
                  to the first fair copy of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY">Composition and Publication: First Fair Copy [<span class="titlem">RF T70</span>]</a>); and by juxtaposing that poem as the first in the anthology with the end of the
                  second volume of <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> emphasized astronomical learning as a shared interest in both the poem and the prose
                  tale. In the tale, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Harry</span> gives <span class="persName">Lucy</span> a drawing of the constellation <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span> “as an introduction to astronomy” (p. 7). Moreover, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> maintained the astronomical theme in the poetry anthology by following <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> with a fair copy of <a class="link_ref" href="the_sun_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“The Sun”</span></a>, which he composed for <span class="date">New Yearʼs, 1 January 1828</span>. That <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs orthographic and punctuation practices appear to have progressed little by the
                  time he composed and fair‐copied <span class="titlem">“Eudosia”</span> several months later—the same kind of catalog poem on a grandiose scale, fair‐copied
                  with the same kind or orthographic eccentricities and even weirder punctuation—can
                  be attributed to a long period of family mourning for the death of his aunt. His father
                  would have been preoccupied at home and in <span class="placeName">Perth</span>, making arrangements for his sisterʼs estate and orphaned children.</p>
               <p>Remaining open to question is whether composition of the initial draft of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> could have begun as early as a date in <span class="date">1827</span>, as <span class="persName">Cook</span> and <span class="persName">Wedderburn</span> supposed. A factor that might argue for confining composition to the <span class="date">first quarter of 1828</span> is the possibility—admittedly questionable—that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> based his opening lines on planetariy observations that were visible in the sky over
                  <span class="placeName">London</span> only during those months, and not in <span class="date">1827</span>. Those details, which survive in the opening lines of the poem as fair‐copied, are
                  missing along with the first page(s) of draft from the <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> manuscript. Thus, a genesis of the <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> draft commencing, say, in <span class="date">the fourth quarter of 1827</span> cannot be neither ruled out nor confirmed.</p>

               <p>From surviving documents, a clear chronology is established based on revisions of
                  one document being incorporated in the next. Strikethroughs and substitutions in the
                  <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> pencil draft are incorporated into the copytext of the fair copy shown in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>; and strikethroughs and substitutions in the latter are in turn incorporated into
                  copytext for the <span class="titlem">MS III</span> fair copy. This genetic history tracks a similar and roughly contemporaneous record
                  of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs development of the poem, <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span></a>, as witnessed in manuscripts likewise contained in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> and <span class="titlem">MS III</span>. Only <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, however, includes a stage of composition in which a fair copy is sacrificed to further
                  revision, at least insofar as surviving evidence can attest.</p>
               <p>As a stage of development in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs compositional methods, <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> along with <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> represent a significant advance, which sprang from learning to use pen and ink in
                  <span class="date">April 1827</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</a>). For the first time, we see preserved draft containing deletions, substitutions,
                  and insertions, both in pencil and in ink, most of them in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs hand. At least one of the interventions is in the hand of <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span>, but this is limited to correcting a mistranscription from the preceding draft. <span class="persName">Margaret</span> proofread; she did not herself revise <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs text, unless she did so verbally. Evidence suggests that she did censor, however,
                  by marking text she deemed inappropriate in some way. Thus, these states of text open
                  a window onto <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs compositional process as an interaction with his audience, his parents—with his
                  mother acting as proofreader and, to a limited extent, as editor. Perhaps these states
                  of draft and fair copy were preserved for this reason, that they recorded a distinct
                  stage of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs learning to write as an interactive process.</p>
               <p><span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> is also significant for its scope. It is one among several projects of <span class="date">1828</span> which are marked by their ambition and length, including the versification of <span class="persName">Scott</span>ʼs novel, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Monastery</span></span>, and the “poem on the universe”, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Eudosia</span></span>. Of these three, only <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> reached a conclusion.</p>

                  <h3><span class="headingNumber">1.6.1. </span><span class="head">Earliest Surviving Draft, <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem">“<span class="name">cepheus</span> and <span class="name">bootes</span> now”</span></span> (<span class="titlem">MS IA</span>)</span></h3>
                  <p>This pencil‐on‐paper manuscript in a cursive hand, <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem">“<span class="name">cepheus</span> and <span class="name">bootes</span> now”</span></span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="#MAJORMS-MSIA" title="MS IA">Manuscripts: <span class="titlem">MS IA</span></a>), begins at line 27 of the poem as fair‐copied in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, and from that point the text extends for 49 lines on all four sides of a vertically
                     folded sheet. The surviving text starts at the top of 1r of the manuscript, lacking
                     title or context, evidently in mid‐career of the poem. While nothing definitive can
                     be determined about whether this manuscript is missing a witness to the original beginning
                     of its text—and, if so, while nothing can be proved about what that opening text consisted
                     of—it is likely that the missing draft closely matched the text as fair‐copied in
                     <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, given the consistency of the proofreading marks from start to finish on that later
                     manuscript (see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY" title="First Fair Copy (RF T70)">First Fair Copy [<span class="titlem">RF T70</span>]</a>).</p>
                  <p>It is possible that an opening piece of the manuscript, now missing, was originally
                     bound in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span>, but that this piece was lost and its survival or whereabouts untraceable, given
                     the current damaged and unbound state of the collection (see <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php#CONTENTS"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span>: Contents, <span style="font-style:italic">b</span></a>).</p>

                     <h4><span class="headingNumber">1.6.1.1. </span><span class="head">Hand</span></h4>
                     <p>The hand is recognizably <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs cursive, identical to the cursive hand in his holograph <a class="link_ref" href="jr_to_jjr_1827-05_al_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem"><span class="date">May 1827</span> letter to his father</span></a>. The latter document—the earliest surviving example of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs use of pen and ink—is composed almost entirely in cursive using a pencil, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> exchanging the pencil for pen and ink only for the closing of the letter, which he
                        also wrote in cursive. He continued beyond his signature to the letter by appending
                        two poems, still using a pen but switching to print lettering. Similarly here, at
                        the end of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> draft, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> switches from pencil to pen and ink for a closing, “I end”, written in cursive. Perhaps
                        he reserved pen and ink for closings in these early cursive manuscripts because the
                        ink suggested to him a sense of finality.</p>
                     <p>In this draft version of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> also uses pen and ink for a few minor revisions, making substitutions in ink by striking
                        through pencil draft with a pen and writing the substituted word above. This usage,
                        too, may have suggested finality to him, an act of polishing the verse. Alternatively
                        or additionally—and one suspects this to be the case in the <span class="titlem"><span class="date">1827</span> letter</span>—<span class="persName">Ruskin</span> felt more at ease manually in dipping a pen to form the strokes of print letters
                        as compared with maintaining the flow of cursive. With respect to penmanship, then,
                        the constrained use of pen and ink in <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem">“<span class="name">cepheus</span> and <span class="name">bootes</span> now”</span></span> represents an earlier developmental stage, comparable to the <span class="titlem"><span class="date">1827</span> letter to his father</span>, whereas the first fair copy, <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, shows him using a pen to write longer phrases, albeit sometimes over top of the
                        same phrases in pencil, so far as one can tell from the photograph.</p>

                     <h4><span class="headingNumber">1.6.1.2. </span><span class="head">Two Successive Endings</span></h4>
                     <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> appears to have ended the poem twice in draft. At the bottom of the inside recto
                        page of the folded sheet (2r), he wrote “end” in pencil, cursive; and on the same
                        line, to the left, he wrote “I end” in ink, also cursive—the ink <span style="font-style:italic">end</span> being presumably the second of the two, though the order cannot be distinguished
                        from the material evidence. This <span style="font-style:italic">finis</span> follows <span class="name">Capricornus (the Sea Goat)</span>, the last‐listed of the constellations in all three manuscript versions (line 64
                        in the second fair copy, <span class="titlem">MS III</span>): “and the <span class="name">goat</span> that is formed in the arched sky“. In draft as well as fair copy, this line carries
                        lexical markers of closure—for one, by beginning the line uniquely with <span style="font-style:italic">and</span>, as if to say, <span style="font-style:italic">and finally</span>; and for another, by ending the line with a flourish supplied by the quaintly poetic
                        modifier <span style="font-style:italic">arched</span> (for sources of this poetic diction, see the contextual gloss for <span style="font-style:italic">arched sky</span> in the witnesses).</p>
                     <p>Another ending is found on the back of the folded sheet (2v), where <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> added nine lines beyond the ending at the foot of the preceding page (2r). Below
                        these nine addtional lines, on a separate line by itself, he again wrote “I end” in
                        pencil longhand; and to the right of that <span style="font-style:italic">finis</span>, he wrote “I end” in ink longhand. (Again, presumably the phrase written in ink was
                        subsequent to the pencil phrase, but the evidence is indeterminate.) These nine lines
                        form the peroration of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> as fair‐copied in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>.</p>
                     <p>As originally concluded, therefore, if the “I end” on 2r truly indicates an earlier
                        intention, <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem">“<span class="name">cepheus</span> and <span class="name">bootes</span> now”</span></span> represented a less ambitious work poetically, aiming solely at a catalogue of stars
                        without any summary reflection on its meaning. In this respect, the first version
                        of the poem resembles lists of constellations that could be found in print sources
                        on astronomy aimed specifically at children, such as <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">An Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children</span></span> (<span class="date">1817</span>)</a> by <span class="persName">Mary Martha Sherwood</span> (<span class="date">1775–1851</span>), although even <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs lists include implicit commentary in the form of Bible verses (see <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note.php#PRINTSOURCES-PRIMERS">Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children</a>). <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs chief original contribution to such elementary lists consists in his epithets describing
                        each constellation. The version of the poem ending with <span class="name">Capricornus</span> is an aesthetic, poetic exercise more than a religious or scientific one.</p>
                     <p>The version of the poem ending with the nine‐line peroration introduces a contest
                        between “history” and “virtue”. The meaning and implications of this contest give
                        <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> trouble, as he revises these concluding lines after having fair‐copied them in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY" title="First Fair Copy (RF T70)">Composition and Publication: First Fair Copy (<span class="titlem">RF T70</span>)</a>; and <a class="link_ref" href="#MYTHS" title="Knowledge versus Christian Faith The Problem of Mythology">Discussion: Knowledge versus Christian Faith</a>).</p>

                     <p>As remarked in <a class="link_ref" href="#DATE" title="Date">Date</a>, the physical appearance of this manuscript of draft for <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> strikingly resembles another item of draft that was probably once bound in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span>, some surviving draft for <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span></a>, which begins <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem">“now must we leave poor martin there”</span></span> (lines 29–62 of book 2 of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs versification of <span class="persName">Scott</span>ʼs novel, as fair‐copied and numbered in <span class="titlem">MS III</span>). The two poemsʼ drafts resemble one another in the size and kind of paper used for
                        the physical document, and in the sprawling cursive hand used for the pencil draft.
                        A difference between the manuscripts is that <span class="titlem">“Monastery”</span> draft contains no substitutions, either in pencil or in pen and ink, as does <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> draft in ink over top of the pencil. (See <a class="link_ref" href="#MAJORMS-MSIA" title="MS IA">Manuscripts: <span class="titlem">MS IA</span></a>; at the <span class="placeName">Beinecke Library</span>, the two manuscripts are now (mistakenly) catalogued together as “<span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Monastery</span></span>—Manuscript, in an unidentified hand, of passages of verse, undated”, in the subseries,
                        Unbound Manuscripts, of the <span class="titlem">John Ruskin Collection, Series II: Manuscripts</span>, <span class="date">1826–1897</span>.)</p>
                     <p>Another item of <span class="titlem">“Monastery”</span> draft, <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem">“come on good horse and let us see”</span></span>, which was definitely bound in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span>, and which contains lines 14–62 of book 3 of the poem as fair‐copied in <span class="titlem">MS III</span>, is written in a cursive hand, one portion in pencil and another in ink. The ink
                        cursive hand resembles that used for the revisions of the <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> version of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>. The physical evidence thus conforms to the probable dating of the <span class="titlem">“Monastery”</span> draft, which is approximately <span class="date">late 1827 through the first quarter or half of 1828</span> (with an additional stage of composition and fair‐copying of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> possibly extending into <span class="date">1828–29</span>; see <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php#COMPPUB"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>: Composition and Publication</a>).</p>

                     draft, which is evidently missing its original opening. As fair‐copied, however, these
                     lines probably do adhere to the original context, since <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> contains markings from the start of the text to the end that can be interpreted as

                     <p>The original fair‐copy text of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> shown in the photographs is print‐lettered using pen and ink, thus dating the manuscript
                        as no earlier than <span class="date">April–May 1827</span>, when <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> first adopted that medium, and probably later in that year or the next, when he had
                        gained more facility. While the dimensions of the original manuscript shown in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> cannot be measured based on a photograph, the lettering appears to be smaller and
                        more uniform compared to the large, spiky, uneven pen‐and‐ink print lettering that
                        characterizes <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs dateable first efforts, such as <a class="link_ref" href="spring_blank_verse_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Spring: Blank Verse”</span></a> and <a class="link_ref" href="wales_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Wales”</span></a> and some poems in the anthology <a class="link_ref" href="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“poetry discriptive”</span></a>.

Vol 2”</span></a>, which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> traced using pen and ink over top of pencil lettering, the characters in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> appear free of any underlying pencil guidelines, although the resolution of the photograph
                        may not have sufficed to capture that level of detail (see <a class="link_ref" href="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</a>).</p>

                     <p>As remarked in <a class="link_ref" href="#DATE" title="Date">Date</a>, physical similarities connect the first fair copy of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> with the fair copy of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, just as resemblances between the two poemsʼ drafts point to an associated process
                        of composition (see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-EARLIEST-DRAFT-COMPARISON" title="Relation to Draft of The Monastery">Relation to Draft of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span></a>). The treatment of text in books 1–2 of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> as fair‐copied in <span class="titlem">MS III</span> has more in common with <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> as fair‐copied in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> than it does either with the work that immediately precedes the <span class="titlem">“Monastery”</span> poem in <span class="titlem">MS III</span>—namely, the anthology <a class="link_ref" href="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“poetry discriptive”</span></a>, which dates from earlier in <span class="date">1827</span>—or with the continuing fair copy of books 3–4 of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, which is set apart from books 1–2 in <span class="titlem">MS III</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php#COMPPUB1"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>: Composition and Publication—Stage One of Composition</a>). For both <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, books 1–2, and the first fair copy of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> adopted a comparatively miniscule print‐lettering, resembling a serif typeface.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, in the <span class="titlem">“poetry discriptive”</span> poems from earlier in <span class="date">1827</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> avoided punctuation almost entirely, whereas punctuation does characterize the fair
                        copies of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> and <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, books 1–2. In both, moreover. the punctuation marks share eccentricities suggesting
                        a learner who has an uncertain grasp of the grammatical and rhetorical function of
                        punctuation but who is excited—at least initially—by the physical appearance of the
                        marks on the page. Almost every line of books 1–2 of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> is punctuated, regardless of grammatical or rhetorical need, and the marks are used
                        exclusively at the ends of lines. This obsessive but misinformed observance abruptly
                        ceases at book 2, line 80, of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, at the top of page 79 of the <span class="titlem">MS III</span> fair copy. Just so, the end of every line of the <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> <span class="titlem">“Constellations”</span> fair copy is notched with a punctuation mark until line 20, where the practice abruptly
                        stops.</p>
                     <p>Where used, the punctuation in the opening lines of both fair‐copied poems often seems
                        arbitrary. While the full‐stop periods make grammatical sense in most instances, the
                        commas, colons, and (most prominently in <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>) an upside‐down semicolon seem interchangeable with one another in their rhetorical
                        use and placement. Both these fair copies give the impression that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> layered over the texts with bookish punctuation to convey the appearance of print,
                        without understanding the grammatical and rhetorical function of the marks. Finally,
                        in both fair copies, the punctuation markup stops abruptly at an arbitrary place,
                        suggesting that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> grew tired of the exercise, ran out of time, or was informed about his erroneous
                        usage.</p>
                     <p>The oddities of punctuation, then, in both manuscripts should be classed with other
                        attempts to give the fair copy an appearance of print. The first letters of each line
                        are capitalized, and the first word of line 1 is rendered in all capitals. As another
                        bookish touch lines are numbered by fives in the left margin.</p>
                     <p>Despite these preoccupations with penmanship and presentation, <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> and books 1–2 of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> are ambitious and interesting projects, a leap beyond the lyric‐descriptive poems
                        fair‐copied in pen‐and‐ink a half‐year earlier—<a class="link_ref" href="spring_blank_verse_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Spring: Blank Verse”</span></a>, <a class="link_ref" href="wales_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Wales”</span></a>, and the poems comprising <a class="link_ref" href="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“poetry discriptive”</span></a>. A half‐year later, the catalogue poem, <a class="link_ref" href="eudosia_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Eudosia”</span></a> nominally maintains the ambition—a “poem on the universe”—yet seems to attempt less.
                        Perhaps the disturbing events that intervened—the Ruskinsʼ aborted <a class="link_ref" href="tour_of_1828_note.php">Tour of <span class="date">1828</span></a>, which was cut short by the death of <a class="link_ref" href="richardson_jessie_note.php"><span class="persName">Jessie Richardson</span></a>, the period of mourning, and the resettlement of <span class="persName">Jessie</span>ʼs orphaned children, including the adoption of <a class="link_ref" href="richardson_mary_note.php"><span class="persName">Mary Richardson</span></a> into the <span class="placeName">Herne Hill</span> household—caused a hiatus in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs learning.</p>

                     <h4><span class="headingNumber">1.6.2.3. </span><span class="head">Margaret Ruskinʼs Role in the Fair‐Copying Process</span></h4>
                     <p>An especially valuable feature of the <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> fair copy is the evidence of <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs participation in the compositional process. At line 54 of the poem, <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs handwriting can be unmistakably identified. The intervention is a penciled correction
                        of a mistranscription of a word from the draft text, substituting the word “bear”
                        for <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs erroneously copied “appear”. The insertion is accompanied by a penciled deletion
                        of “appear” using a style of strikethrough that differs from all other instances of
                        strikethrough, save one at line 30 (see the textual gloss hanging from line 54, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#MONOCEROSGLOSS">“The horn the <span class="name">unicorn</span> doth appear”</a>). From this evidence, one may infer that a series of other pencil marks on the manuscript—a
                        diagonal or double diagonal line at the end of each line of verse—records <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs proofreading of the fair copy against the draft manuscript. That these diagonal
                        marks were <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs is substantiated by their replacement by <span style="font-style:italic">×</span> marks next to certain lines of verse, which evidently signaled her concerns, prompting
                        revisions by <span class="persName">John</span>. It is possible that the proofreading marks were made by somebody other than <span class="persName">Margaret</span>—<span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span>, for example—but his handwriting does not otherwise appear in the manuscript.</p>
                     <p>While we can only infer <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs objections based on the content of the original verse and on <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs substitution, the topics that drew her censorship seem evident enough. An <span style="font-style:italic">×</span> by the constellation <span class="name">Medusaʼs Head</span> suggests that the image was deemed too horrible. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> substituted in the margin a line about the constellation, <span class="name">Herschelʼs Telescope</span>, replacing the ancient wonder of <span class="persName">Medusa</span>ʼs stare, with which the pagan hero <span class="persName">Perseus</span> wreaked violence and retribution, with the modern wonder of the seven‐foot optical
                        instrument, with which the British scientific hero, <span class="persName">William Herschel</span> (<span class="date">1738–1822</span>), discovered the planet <span class="name">Uranus</span>. Even the feline violence of the <span class="name">“furious lynx”</span> was tagged to be tamed, replaced by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> with its “keen‐eyed” attribute. Apparently, the constellation <span class="name">Altar</span> evoked dangerously pagan practices, drawing two <span style="font-style:italic">×</span>s for revision, so <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> inserted the Scriptural epithet, “gods fire”, implying that the “strange fire” of
                        paganism would be snuffed out (<span class="titlem">Lev.</span> 10). One change was demanded to prevent a jest from disturbing the gravity of the
                        subject; and some lines were marked with an <span style="font-style:italic">×</span> for no obvious reason other than to improve the verse: the trite and redundant epithet
                        “pretty” was rejected, and an imperfect rhyme needed mending (see textual and contextual
                        glosses hanging from line 14, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#TELESCOPIUMGLOSS">“Then the dread medusas head”</a>; line 30, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#LYNXTEXTGLOSS">“After that the furious <span class="name">lynx</span>”</a>; line 44, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#GODSFIREGLOSS">“Next to it the <span class="name">altar</span>”</a>; lines 17 and 64, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#LEPUSTEXTGLOSS">“After that doth come the <span class="name">lyre</span>” and “I wish I had not observed the <span class="name">lyre</span>”</a>; lines 12 and 40, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#CYGNUSTEXTGLOSS">“Then the very pretty <span class="name">swan</span>”</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#GRUSTEXTGLOSS">“Next the very pretty <span class="name">crane</span>”</a>; lines 41 and 42, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#DOWNTEXTGLOSS">“<span class="name">Antinoüs</span> and <span class="name">arrow</span> soon” and “After it the <span class="name">southern crown</span>”</a>).</p>
                     <p>Each of the lines marked with an <span style="font-style:italic">×</span> prompted a revision in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs hand. In most cases, he drafted the revision in the margin adjacent to the line,
                        first writing in cursive with a pencil, and then in some cases writing in cursive
                        with pen and ink to revise the revision over top of the pencil. Insofar as the available
                        evidence shows, then, the revisions were invented by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>; no other hand is present in the draft revision, although of course we cannot know
                        what discussion, if any, surrounded his decisions. We also cannot know for certain
                        at what point in the fair‐copying the process of proofreading and marking for revision
                        began. Since the poem is fair‐copied through to the end of the extant <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> draft, it is reasonable to conclude that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> completed the fair‐copying before it was subjected to scrutiny, although some finishing
                        touches are incomplete: the marginal line numbering halts after line 60, with fifteen
                        remaining lines left unnumbered; and as already remarked, most punctuation, particularly
                        at the ends of verse lines, is abandoned after about line 20. Perhaps at this final
                        stage of touch‐up, <span class="persName">Margaret</span> (or perhaps <span class="persName">Margaret</span> as well as <span class="persName">John James</span>) intervened with a review. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> may even have been surprised by the demand for revision. The manuscript is unique
                        among the juvenilia as a fair copy that was subjected to a critique, resulting in
                        revisions made on the fair copy itself.</p>
                     <p>It may be no coincidence that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs marginal line‐numbering was arrested at line 60, since at lines 57–60 the most
                        extensive single passage is flagged for revision, with a long diagonal line and <span style="font-style:italic">×</span>s marking a quatrain about the constellation <span class="name">Libra (the Scales)</span>, ending in a mention of the <span class="name">Milky Way</span>. The passage may have been flagged merely because the original lines, both in draft
                        and fair copy, are somewhat incoherent: the lines develop a paradox of the <span class="name">Scales</span> being capable of weighing “nothing” yet containing a “thousand more”—more even than
                        “the beautiful <span class="name">milky way</span>”—but with the implied object, <span style="font-style:italic">stars</span>, being absent from the lines. The omission may or may not have been deliberate, but
                        instead of revising to clarify the paradoxical conceit, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> substituted a couplet that veers to a different topic altogether—<span class="name">the Scales</span> as a symbol of justice, which was a traditional treatment of this constellation,
                        particularly in Roman astronomy (see the contextual gloss hanging from line 57, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#LIBRAGLOSS">“The scales that nothing to weigh would bear”</a>).</p>
                     <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> began the revision of the <span class="name">Libra</span> quatrain in pencil at the bottom of the inner fold of the pamphlet, sprawling across
                        the fold to the opposite recto (pp. 3–4, which would have been blank at that point),
                        and coninuing onto the back of the pamphlet (p. 4). Nine lines of cursive pencil text
                        wrestle with the topic of justice (see the textual gloss hanging from lines 57–60,
                        <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#LIBRATEXTGLOSS">“that nothing to weigh would bear / . . . / More than than the beautiful milky way”</a>); and then, at the bottom and top‐right of the inner fold (pp. 3–4), he overwrote
                        this pencil draft with pen and ink, still in cursive, recasting the lines on <span class="name">Libra</span> as the couplet they became in the <span class="titlem">MS III</span> fair copy. Next, on remaining space in the middle of the inner recto (p. 3), and
                        over top of pencil draft on the back (p. 4), <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> drafted in pen and ink new lines on the <span class="name">Milky Way</span> as they appear in the <span class="titlem">MS III</span> fair copy (lines 65–69). In these new lines, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> expanded on the <span class="name">Milky Way</span>, previously mentioned only as a comparison with what stars could be weighed in <span class="name">Libra</span>ʼs scales. Now he elaborated on the myth of the <span class="name">Milky Way</span> as a roadway to heaven for the heroes of mythology. In connection with this image,
                        his revisions reveal that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> wrestled, not just with squeamish objections to violent or pagan imagery, but with
                        broader concepts such as the relation between “history” (revised to “knowledge”) and
                        “virtue” (see <a class="link_ref" href="#MYTHS" title="Knowledge versus Christian Faith The Problem of Mythology">Discussion—Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology</a>).</p>

This label does not necessarily
                     signify that this poetry anthology (along with the preceding <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . .

It seems likely that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> would not have waited long to fair‐copy <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> following his revision of the <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> fair copy, and that he finalized the poem in this <span class="titlem">MS III</span> version—assuming that no other fair copy intervened—as part of the anthology sometime

               <h2><span class="headingNumber">1.7. </span><span class="head">Discussion</span></h2>
               <p><span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, like other poems and prose by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> of <span class="date">1826–28</span> that mention the fixed stars and other astronomical phenomena, was composed in context
                  of popular education in astronomy for adults and children in the <span class="date">early nineteenth century</span> in <span class="placeName">Britain</span>. This movement is surveyed in <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note.php">Astronomical Education</a>, and parts of the following discussion are keyed to the context of that broader note.</p>
               <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs purpose in <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> is more poetic than scientific. As his most original contribution to the versified
                  catalogue of constellations that constitutes the poem, he assigns descriptive epithets
                  to several of the constellation names. While the poem is not entirely lacking in the
                  influence of childrenʼs scientific lessons in astronomy, which were typical the period,
                  <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> admitted in a note added belatedly in the compositional process—the note first appears
                  in the <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-2D-FAIR-COPY" title="Second Fair Copy (MS III)">Second Fair Copy</a>—that his arrangement of constellation names is unsystematic with respect to the starsʼ
                  actual positions in the sky. The note is less disingenuous than it seems and may play
                  down a significant achievement in spatial imagination (see <a class="link_ref" href="#PROJECT" title="The Constellations as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception">“The Constellations” as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception</a>); nonetheless, the poem represents a stage in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs ongoing astromical education (see <a class="link_ref" href="#STAGE" title="The Constellations as Marking a Stage of Astronomical Education">“The Constellations” as Marking a Stage of Astronomical Education</a>).</p>
               <p>As a stage of learning, the poem is somewhat elusive in allowing one to gauge the
                  extent of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs knowledge about the constellations and their myths. Several of his epithets are
                  so generalized, particularly those applied to beasts and birds represented by the
                  constellations, that his source may as well have derived from Aesop's Fables as from
                  an astronomy textbook (see <a class="link_ref" href="boyhood_books_note.php#AESOP">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Physical Descriptions—<span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Fables of <span class="persName">Aesop</span></span></span></a>). Given his mother's censorship described in <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-MR" title="Margaret Ruskinʼs Role in the FairCopying Process"><span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs Role in the Fair‐Copying Process</a>, Ruskin may have avoided expressing some of what he knew about myth. Regrettably,
                  to understand his exposure, the identity of a “lesson book” on astronomy mentioned
                  in <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III”</span></a> remains conjectural, but on the evidence of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> he must have had access to an up-to-date source like a recent star atlas, which likely
                  would have relayed legendary as well as scientific information (see <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note#PRINTSOURCES-ATLASES.php">Astronomical Education: Print Sources of Astronomical Education—Star Atlases</a>; and <a class="link_ref" href="#MYTHS" title="Knowledge versus Christian Faith The Problem of Mythology">Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology</a>).</p>
               <p>In the three diplomatically edited texts of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, contextual glosses attached to each of the constellation names summarize the information
                  commonly available in popular works on astronomy published in the 1820s. The information
                  includes the position in the sky and the periods of the year when each constellation
                  was visible, if at all, in the night sky above London; the legends, if any, associated
                  with each constellation, especially the more commonly known Greek and Roman myths
                  connected with ancient constellations; and the origin of comparatively more recent
                  constellations and their significance for British amateur astronomers in the early
                  nineteenth century (e.g., at this time, the heavens were mapped with a large number
                  of constellations invented between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, which became
                  obsolete in the later nineteenth and twentieth centuries; also, some constellations
                  were typically treated as pairs, which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> for some reason separated and named singly in his poem). Given the uncertainty about
                  Ruskin's sources of information, the glosses survey what <span class="persName">he</span> may have known, not what he necessarily did know or was allowed or encouraged to
                  learn.</p>

                  and punctuated with holes in the place of the starsʼ positions, which glowed when
                  held up to a light (ca. <span class="date">1824–25</span>); and <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, (<span class="date">1824</span>) by <span class="persName">Jacob Green</span> (<span class="date">1790–1841</span>), an American chemist who produced the book while between professorships at <span class="orgName">Princeton University</span> and at <span class="orgName">Jefferson Medical College</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SMITHGREEN"><span class="persName">Smith</span>, <span class="titlem">“Jacob Green”</span></a>, 421).

                  <p>Following this introductory reading, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs period of composition, revision, and fair‐copying of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> in <span class="date">1827–28</span> would have accompanied or shortly followed his reading of additional educational
                     dialogues on astronomy, which pick up where the conversations in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span> leave off—namely, the astronomy of the constellations both as a discipline of practical
                     and scientific reasoning and as an appreciation of beauty. This stage of reading consisted
                     at least of volume 2, “Of Astronomy”, of <a class="link_ref" href="joyce_jeremiah_note.php"><span class="persName">Jeremiah Joyce</span></a>ʼs <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span></a>; and of passages in <a class="link_ref" href="day_thomas_note.php"><span class="persName">Thomas Day</span></a>ʼs <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The History of Sandford and Merton</span></span></a>, in which the Tutor, <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span>, draws on <span class="persName">Harry Sandford</span>ʼs practical experience in reading the night sky to spark <span class="persName">Tommy Merton</span>ʼs admiration for the beauty and wonder of the fixed stars (see <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note#PRINTSOURCES-DIALOGUES">Astronomical Education: Scientific and Practical Astronomical Dialogues</a>). <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> himself identifies his use of these latter sources for astronomical education in

Vol I”</span></a>.</p>
                  <p>It is possible that this first stage of astronomical education, preceding and contemporaneous
                     with the composition of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, also relied on one of the primers in astronomical science written for children in
                     the first third of the century (see <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note.php#PRINTSOURCES-PRIMERS">Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children</a>). This kind of text was more likely to emphasize memorization rather than dialogic
                     exchange; and primers of the <span class="date">1820s</span> for young readers perhaps more emphatically staked the purpose of astronomical study
                     in religious admiration rather than practical and scientific reasoning. In its form,
                     Ruskin's poem embodies the memorization exercises typical of these primers, while
                     its rhetoric reflects no particular agenda of piety--at least not initially so. Arguably,
                     that agenda is layered over the initial version, at the urging of Margaret Ruskin's
                     flags for revision (see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-MR" title="Margaret Ruskinʼs Role in the FairCopying Process">Margaret Ruskinʼs Role in the Fair‐Copying Process</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="#CATALOGUE" title="The Genre of The Constellations">The Genre of “The Constellations”</a>).</p>
                  <p>By <span class="date">1828–29</span>, one year beyond the composition, revision, and fair‐copying of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> recorded statistical astronomical information in his <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III”</span></a>, which was typically found in sophisticated print sources known as <span style="font-style:italic">star atlases</span>, although such information was also plagiarized from star atlases in the more advanced
                     astronomical primers for young readers, such as <span class="persName">Aspin</span>ʼs <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>. The identity of this type of source or sources used by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> remains elusive (see <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note.php#PRINTSOURCES-ATLASES">Astromical Education: Star Atlases</a>). Whatever the source, while <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs presentation of astronomical information in <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . .

                  <h3><span class="headingNumber">1.7.2. </span><span class="head">“The Constellations” as a Record of Actual Astronomical Observations</span></h3>
                  <p>As indicated by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs sources, <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> is a bookish poem. Even in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs books, however, <span class="persName">Day</span>ʼs and <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs tutors begin study of astronomy by directing their pupilsʼ attention to the evening
                     sky. To what extent, if any, might <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs composition of his poem have involved actual astronomical observation?</p>
                  <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> opens his poem by hailing <span class="name">Venus</span> and <span class="name">Mars</span>. In the instructional dialogues, planets—the <span style="font-style:italic">wandering stars</span>—are not an obvious starting point for astronomy lessons in the open air (see <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note.php#PRINTSOURCES-DIALOGUES">Astronomical Education: Instructional Dialogues on Astronomy</a>). Fictional tutors typically begin by asking pupils to find the most commonly recognizable
                     constellation or <span style="font-style:italic">fixed stars</span>, <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span>. As suggested by an earlier poem, <a class="link_ref" href="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Glen of Glenfarg” (“Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill”)</span></a>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> had long been able to orient himself to that formation in the night sky. Nonetheless,
                     equally striking objects for young stargazers are <span class="name">Venus</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic">Morning Star</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Evening Star</span>, and <span class="name">Mars</span>, the red planet. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> may have chosen those planets to begin his poem because they are famously beautiful
                     and striking celestial bodies with familiar mythological associations. In his books,
                     <span class="name">Venus</span> especially was given special status for its beauty (see <a class="link_ref" href="#PROJECT" title="The Constellations as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception">“The Constellations” as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception</a>). It is also possible that the particular alignment described in the poem—<span class="name">Venus</span> and <span class="name">Mars</span> visible on the ecliptic, with the constellation <span class="name">Orion</span> setting on the horizon—indicates an actual and datable observation.</p>
                  <p>In the poem, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> positions <span class="name">Venus</span> specifically as the Evening Star near the constellation <span class="name">Orion</span>. According to a digital‐age star chart, the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Sky &amp; Telescope Interactive Sky Chart</span></span>, <span class="name">Venus</span> would have been visible from <span class="placeName">London</span> as the Evening Star, setting in the west along with <span class="name">Orion</span> during <span class="date">April–June 1828</span>. (During that period, another bright object that was visible low in the evening sky,
                     which an observer might have confused with a planet, was <span class="name">Sirius or the “Dog Star”</span>, in the constellation <span class="name">Canis Major</span>. It is positioned directly below <span class="name">Orion</span>.) During those same months, <span class="name">Mars</span> would have risen from the east, traveling “high . . . [in] the sky”, as <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem says, a few hours after <span class="name">Venus</span> had set (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SKYANDTELESCOPE"><span class="titlem">Sky &amp; Telescope, Interactive Star Chart and Celestial Almanac</span></a>, accessed <span class="date">12 April 2023</span>).</p>
                  <p>This calculation accords with tables of constellations in the <span class="titlem">“Calendarium Stellaris”</span>, subtitled an “Easy Method of Finding the Stars for Every Month of the Year”, in
                     the <span class="date">1825</span> edition of <span class="persName">Aspin</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span>. Describing the sky viewed from <span class="placeName">London</span> each month “in about the middle of . . . the month, at half‐past nine oʼclock in
                     the evening”, the <span class="titlem">Calendarium</span> lists <span class="name">Orion</span> as appearing “nearly on the meridian” in January and moving toward the “space between
                     “W. by S. and S.W. by W.” by March. The constellation is omitted from the listings
                     for April, presumably because it would have set by 9:00 <span style="font-variant: small-caps">P.M.</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Aspin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 161, 167, 168–69). The digital star chart shows that <span class="name">Orion</span> set in the late‐afternoon dusk of <span class="date">April 1828</span>, preceded by <span class="name">Venus</span>; and as the weeks advanced, <span class="name">Venus</span> set later in the evening than <span class="name">Orion</span>, which had vanished by sunset. A comparison of findings using the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Sky &amp; Telescope Interactive Sky Chart</span></span> with the <span class="titlem">Calendarium</span> identifies <span class="date">April 1828</span>, therefore, as the period when the tracks of <span class="name">Venus</span> and <span class="name">Mars</span> overlapped with a sighting of <span class="name">Orion</span>. According to the digital star chart, this configuration was never visible at dusk
                     or nighttime in <span class="date">1827</span>.</p>
                  <p>Tending to confirm these observations in the first quarter of the year, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> includes the southern constellation, <span class="name">Crater</span>, in the poem, which is visible from the latitude of <span class="placeName">London</span> in the evening sky, annually from December through May. The poem also names southern
                     constellations that cannot be viewed from the latitude of <span class="placeName">London</span> at all, but <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs choice of these appears related to a sentiment for their legends. The choice of
                     <span class="name">Crater</span> seems arbitrary other than its regular rising and setting in the southern sky, culminating
                     in April (see <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#CRATERGLOSS"><span class="name">Crater</span>, contextual gloss</a>).</p>
                  <p>It is possible, then, that actual observations of the evening sky lay behind the composition
                     of the poemʼs introductory lines, a possibility that aligns with the evidence in <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB" title="Composition and Publication">Composition and Publication</a> supporting the year <span class="date">1828</span> as a probable period of composition or at least revision of the poem. (Since the
                     partially surviving manuscript of the <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> draft lacks the opening lines, the possibility of an earlier date in <span class="date">1827</span> for the inception of the poem remains open.) April–May was typically the period when
                     <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> prepared poems for his fatherʼs birthday in May, thus suggesting an occasion as well
                     as a terminus a quo for the start of either composition or revision of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>.</p>
                  <p>Whether or not <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> looked up from his books to the sky for an inspiration to open his poem, he was also
                     prompted to admiration of <span class="name">Orion</span> by <span class="persName">Day</span>ʼs fictional character, <span class="persName">Tommy Merton</span>, who, “looking up to the sky . . . observed so remarkable a constellation, that he
                     . . . begged to know the name”. On learning it was called <span class="name">Orion</span>, he “was so delighted with the grandeur and beauty of this glorious constellation,
                     that he could not help observing it, by intervals, all the evening; and he was surprised
                     to see that it seemed to pass on, in a right line drawn from east to west; and that
                     all the stars he had become acquainted with moved every night in the same direction”.
                     In the opening four lines of the poem, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> echoes the alliterative modifiers with which <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> describes the experience of gazing at the constellations: “‘I should think there
                     would be a very great pleasure in observing such a number of <span style="font-style:italic">glorious</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">glittering</span> bodies as are now above us’” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><span class="persName">Day</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The History of Sandford and Merton</span></span></a>, 187–88, 165 [emphasis added]; see also <a class="link_ref" href="#PROJECT" title="The Constellations as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception">“The Constellations” as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception</a>).</p>
                  <p>Following <span class="name">Orion</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> goes on to name circumpolar constellations—all “northern” constellations, as announced
                     in the first part of the poemʼs subtitle (lines 7–14; see <a class="link_ref" href="#TITLE" title="Title">Title</a>). As possible real sightings, it is striking that he begins with <span class="name">Ursa Major (the Great Bear)</span>, which likewise tops the list for April in the <span class="titlem">“Calendarium Stellaris”</span>, that constellation being positioned “in the zenith”. Moreover, the “lower star in
                     the tail” of the bear “at about 65 degrees high” is “one of those called <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Charlesʼs Wain</span></span>”—the next to be identified by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, albeit not surprisingly. All six of the following constellations named in the poem
                     were also visible in April, according to the <span class="titlem">Calendarium</span>: <span class="name">Draco (the Dragon)</span>, <span class="name">Coma Berenices (Bereniceʼs Hair)</span>, <span class="name">Corona Borealis (the Northern Crown)</span>, Cygnus (the Swan). <span class="name">Cor Caroli (Charlesʼs Heart)</span>, and <span class="name">Medusaʼs Head</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Aspin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 168–69). Only with <span class="name">Telescopium Herschelii (<span class="persName">Herschel</span>ʼs Telescope)</span> does <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> depart from naming what he could actually have viewed overhead in <span class="date">April 1828</span>, and that choice was a substitution to placate alarm over <span class="name">Medusaʼs Head</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-MR" title="Margaret Ruskinʼs Role in the FairCopying Process">Margaret Ruskinʼs Role in the Fair‐Copying Process</a>.</p>
                  <p>Hereafter in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, the sequence of constellations appears more erratic, with the repeated “next
                     comes” ceasing necessarily to refer to star formations that are adjacent in the dome
                     of the sky. In the second fair copy, in <span class="titlem">MS III</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> forestalled objections by adding a note with a caveat: “These constellations though
                     they are next in this poetry are not next in the sky”. The note is not attached by
                     an asterisk to a particular line in the poem, seeming to refer to the whole, so it
                     is unclear whether he would have exempted the first fourteen lines from observable
                     phenomena.</p>

                  <h3><span class="headingNumber">1.7.3. </span><span class="head">The Genre of “The Constellations”</span></h3>
                  <p>The genre of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, at its most basic level, is a catalogue poem, simply naming the constellations.
                     As a list, the poem shares some characteristics with an astronomical primer, <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">An Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children</span></span> (<span class="date">1817</span>)</a> by <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> (<span class="date">1775–1851</span>). While no record of this book or a work like it is recorded in the Ruskin family
                     library, <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> introduces the topic of the constellations with a heading identical to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs main title, <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, and follows that heading with subdivisions, each with its own heading, that sorts
                     the constellations into “Constellations in the Zodiac or Ecliptic”, “Constellations
                     to the North of the Ecliptic”, and “Constellations to the South of the Ecliptic”—subdivisions
                     that resemble <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs subtitle to his poem, “Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and Some of the Southern”.</p>
                  <p>As a catalogue poem, <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> perhaps reflects <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs pedagogical assumption that a childʼs act of naming and identifying heavenly bodies
                     precedes understanding of the physical laws that govern their motion, and the development
                     of a spatial imagination required to grasp the relation of the earthʼs revolutions
                     to the apparent motion of the constellations across the sky. In each of her lists,
                     <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> merely lists the names of constellations—the Latin name followed by its English translation—which
                     matches <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs procedure in his catalogue poem, except for his added embellishment of a poetic
                     epithet to describe some of the constellations. <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> provides no information about each of the constellations; rather, she annotates the
                     respective lists with a Bible verse that mentions the stars and praises the <span class="persName">Creator</span>.</p>
                  <p>As a reflection of a <a class="link_ref" href="#STAGE" title="The Constellations as Marking a Stage of Astronomical Education">stage of astronomical education</a>, "The Constellations" obviously represents an elementary exercise in naming and memorization.
                     Unlike Mrs. Sherwood's lists of names, however, Ruskin's catalogue is not encased
                     within Scripture quotations that monitor the aim of memorization with expressions
                     of piety. Arguably, the compositional history suggests that Christian admonition was
                     layered onto the poem to contain the paganism presented by its list of names. See

                  <p>“These constellations though they are next in this poetry are not next in the sky”.
                     This note, which Ruskin added to the second fair copy, can be read as an admission
                     of failure to recognize the astronomer's mapping of the visible galaxy. Turn the sentence
                     around--"These constellations, though not next in the sky, are next in this poetry"--and
                     the statement stakes a claim for poetic form.</p>
                  <p>As an aesthetic project, <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> derives from an exercise in spatial perception and translating that perception into
                     a graphic representation. In <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The History of Sandford and Merton</span></span>, <span class="persName">Tommy Merton</span> proposes to <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> to memorize the positions of the stars forming the constellations by “‘mak[ing] a
                     mark upon . . . paper for every star in <span class="name">Charlesʼ Wain</span>; and I would place the marks just as I see the stars placed in the sky; and I would
                     entreat you to write the names for me, and this I would do till I was acquainted with
                     all the stars in the heavens’”. <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> applauds the project but points out that paper is flat, whereas the sky, as <span class="persName">Tommy</span> says, “‘seems to rise from the earth on every side like the dome of a great church’”.
                     “‘Then if you were to have some round body’”, <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> suggests, “‘I should think it would correspond to the different parts of the sky,
                     and you might place your stars with more exactness’”. The tutor accordingly supplies
                     <span class="persName">Tommy</span> with a paper‐covered ball, enabling him to devise his own celestial globe based on
                     his own observations of the constellations, remarking both the constellationsʼ relative
                     positions and their nightly movements in the sky. Starting by drawing his “favourite
                     constellation of <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span>”, <span class="persName">Tommy</span> next marks the constellation situated on the opposite side of the Pole‐star, which
                     <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> identifies as <span class="name">Cassiopeia</span>; and then he is captured by the “grandeur and beauty” of the “glorious constellation”
                     <span class="name">Orion</span>, which “he could not help observing . . . by intervals, all the evening” as “it seemed
                     to pass on, in a right line drawn from east to west” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><span class="persName">Day</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The History of Sandford and Merton</span></span></a>, 164–65, 187–88). Is <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, his version of putting the constellations on paper, albeit on flat paper?</p>
                  <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> begins his poem with <span class="persName">Tommy</span>ʼs admiration of the “grandeur and beauty” of <span class="name">Orion</span> rather than with the practical lesson initiated by <span class="persName">Day</span>ʼs and <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs tutors, who advise first finding <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span>, then tracing its pointer stars to the <span class="name">Pole Star</span>, thereby enabling one to locate the other northern circumpolar constellations in
                     relation to the Wain (i.e., <span class="name">Ursa Major</span>, the Great Bear). As <span class="persName">Day</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> explains, “by remembering these stars” that form <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span>, one can “very easily observe those which are next to them, and learn their names
                     too, till you are acquainted with the whole face of the heavens” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><span class="persName">Day</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">History of Sandford and Merton</span></span></a>, 163; see also <span class="persName">Joyce</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span>, 2:16–19). This is the practical recommendation by <span class="persName">Harry Sandford</span>, the farmerʼs boy, for how to find oneʼs way when lost on a dark night. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, in lines 7–11, does name a cluster of circumpolar constellations, starting with
                     <span class="name">Ursa Major</span> and <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span>. First, however, he predicates his sequence on beauty rather than pragmatism, by
                     beginning the poem with “stars” traditionally regarded as the most beautiful—<span class="name">Venus</span>, the so‐called Morning Star and Evening Star, “Glittering in the evening air”, a
                     wandering rather than a fixed star; and “beside it”, <span class="name">Orionʼs Belt</span>, “a glorious sight for all sky loving men”. Even for <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs drier <span class="persName">Tutor</span>, <span class="name">Venus</span> is “by far the most beautiful of . . . all” planets, prompting a quotation from <span class="persName">Milton</span> praising the Evening and Morning Star; and for <span class="persName">Tommy Merton</span>, “<span class="name">Orion</span>, which rose every night and glittered in the south”, entices his continuing star‐gazing,
                     perhaps also supplying <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> with his rhapsodic modifier (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span></a>, 2:198; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><span class="persName">Day</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">History of Sandford and Merton</span></span></a>, 199). From this glittering horizon, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem leads the eye aloft along the ecliptic to <span class="name">Mars</span>, “high / On his throne” and thence to the circumpolar “greater bear” with “<span class="name">charlesʼs wain</span>”.</p>
                  <p>Beyond initially declaring the constellations "a glorious sight" as opposed to a utilitarian
                     compass, does the poem go on to form a coherent graphic translation of the sky? If,
                     as Ruskin's belated note in MS III admits, the poem's sequence of constellation names
                     are "not next in the sky"--that is, if the poem does not in a systematic manner, as
                     Mr. Barlow "'entreat[s]'", perform the functionally pedagogical purpose of "'plac[ing]
                     the marks just as I see the stars placed in the sky; and . . . writ[ing] the names
                     for me, . . . till I was acquainted with all the stars in the heavens’”--then what
                     pattern, if any, is formed by situating the constellations "next in this poetry"?
                     Does the ordering of the constellations in the poem reveal an aesthetic, if not a
                     practical aim?</p>
                  <p>While the poem's repeated “next” seems to line up the constellation names without
                     a plan, the sequence of naming can be interpreted as the equivalent of <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span>ʼs paper globe--that is, the constellation names inscribe a formal pattern on a star
                     map that reads as a spherical shape plotted on a flat plane. Sources were available
                     to Ruskin containing examples of planispheres, such as Jamieson's "Stereographic Projection
                     of the Northern Celestial Hemisphere on the Plane of the Equinoctial" (Celestial Atlas,
                     pl. 1). The poem attempts this "projection" in two ways. First, most simply, the scientific
                     dialogues modeled language for Ruskin's speaker to describe looking at his "glorious
                     sight": “there” is <span class="name">Venus</span> “in the evening air” with <span class="name">Orion</span> “beside it”; and having thus anchored Venus and Orion on a horizontal plane, the
                     speaker raises the eye “high” to <span class="name">Mars</span>, thus forming an arc. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> anchors an on the horizon and inscribes a spatial arc upward in the sky. Second,
                     in the poem's pattern of naming the constellations, a spatial pattern emerges of repeated
                     anchoring and arcing. The poem can be read as a verbal planisphere.</p>
                  <p>The sequence begins with the northern circumpolar constellations (lines 7-11), as
                     do the scientific dialogues, which achieve their aims by identifying only a few of
                     these--Charles's Wain inside of Ursa Major, its pointer stars leading the eye to the
                     Pole Star, which forms the tip of Ursa Minor's tail. In Ruskin's poem, the circumpolar
                     constellation not only anchor a point in the polar north; the poem also subsequently
                     returns to that anchor by naming additional circumpolar constellations--or constellations
                     near the polar circle--at fairly regular intervals: Cor Caroli (Charles's Heart, line
                     13), Ursa Minor (Little Bear, line 18), Cepheus and Bootes (line 27), Lynx (line 30),
                     and Cameleopardalis (line 33). In between these returns to the center, the poem arcs
                     outward by naming constellations on the periphery of the planisphere. This oscillating
                     pattern begins by naming Cygnus (the Swan, line 12), which, viewed from London, skirts
                     the north-northeast horizon (i.e., at 9:00 P.M. in the evening, to adopt Aspin's standard,
                     and choosing the first quarter of 1828 for observation). From Cygnus, the poem's next-named
                     constellation (Cor Caroli) returns the viewer to the center, only to be directed back
                     to the periphery with Caput Medusae (Medusa's Head, line 14, as originally drafted
                     and fair-copied), which lies on the north-northwest horizon. This time, before returning
                     to the center, the next names circle the viewer back to the northeast horizon near
                     Cygnus, by calling out Equuleus (Little Horse), Anser (Goose), and Lyra (Lyre) (lines
                     15-17). Then back to the center (Ursa Minor), only to rebound to the Cygnus group
                     in the northeast by naming Vulpecula (the Fox, line 19; see plates 14-15 of Urania's
                     Mirror, which picture all these constellations). The pattern is comparable to placing
                     one's thumb on the polar north of a celestial globe, or on the center-point of a planisphere
                     map of the northern hemisphere, and extending one's fingers first toward the quadrant
                     containing Cygnus, and then rotating toward the quadrant containing Perseus et Caput
                     Medusae, and then back again.</p>
                  <p>Having established this sideways rotation, at line 20 the poem plunges into the southern
                     hemisphere, casting a meridian arc from North Pole to South Pole. Thus, a circle becomes
                     a sphere. Naming the "blessed cross", Ruskin forms a latitudinal vector that can point
                     simultaneously north and south, since the name <span style="font-style:italic">cross</span> can refer either to Cygnus, which is also known as the Northern Cross, or to Crux,
                     the Southern Cross. To confirm the southern direction, Ruskin next names Robur Carolinum
                     (Charles's Oak, line 21), which is nearly adjacent to Crux. Then, sending a latitudinal
                     line back up the sphere, the sequence passes through Crater (the Cup, line 22)--a
                     southern constellation that, unlike Crux and Robur Carolinum, lies far enough north
                     to be visible from London on the southwest horizon. Continuing north, the poem lands
                     on Hercules and Cerberus (lines 23-24), near the northern pole. Having inscribed this
                     latitudinal circle, the poem returns to the longitudinal circle by again naming constellations
                     in the Cygnus group--Lacerta (the Lizard, line 25), and Aquila (the Eagle, line 26).
                     Finally, the poem regains the northern pole by naming Cepheus, the King, and Bootes,
                     the Huntsman, (line 27), constellations that are balanced on nearly opposite sides
                     of the pole. And then the poem loops to the South Pole again, naming Apus (Bird of
                     Paradise, line 28, Anglicized as the English "Hirundo" or Swallow, in Ruskin's translation).</p>

                  <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> makes a point of naming constellations with British associations, including <span class="name">Telescopium Herschelii (<span class="persName">Herschel</span>ʼs Telescope)</span> and the Carolingian constellations, <span class="name">Cor Caroli (Charlesʼs Heart)</span> and <span class="name">Rober Carolinum (Charlesʼs Oak)</span>—the latter requiring a plunge into southern constellations invisible to British viewers.
                     <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> also lends an English inflection to constellation names where possible: for example,
                     <span class="name">Apus</span> is not the tropical Bird of Paradise but the northern Swallow; <span class="name">Leo</span> is not the fierce <span class="name">Nemean Lion</span> but the “generous” and therefore, one supposes, British kingly beast (see the contextual
                     glosses for these constellations; see also <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note.php#PRINTSOURCES-PRIMERS">Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children</a>).</p>
                  <p>British pride in the nationʼs standing in astronomy was aroused by competition with
                     the French. The French astronomer, Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille (1713-62), who mapped
                     the stars in the southern hemisphere from the vantage of the Cape of Good Hope in
                     south Africa, took aim at Robur Carolinum, which honored Charles II of England. As
                     Lacaille created numerous new constellations of his own in the southern hemisphere,
                     he eliminated the British honorific constellation, criticizing its inventor, the English
                     astronomer Edmond Halley (1656-1742), for an illogical redistribution of stars originally
                     belonging to the ancient southern constellation, Argo Navis (the Ship of the Argonauts).
                     Restoring Robur's stars to the ship's prow, Lacaille justified uprooting Robur on
                     ostensibly scientific grounds, given that new constellations typically were formed
                     from "unformed" stars--that is, stars ignored by Ptolomy in plotting the ancient constellations--rather
                     than by robbing old constellations of their stars for new configurations. In designing
                     his own new constellations, Lacaille was inspired by an Enlightenment principle of
                     honoring the modern arts and sciences rather than paying tribute to individual monarchs.
                     Historians suspect Lacaille, however, of a prejudicial view when targeting specifically
                     a British honorific constellation, while inconsistently retaining constellations that
                     paid tribute to other nations' rulers (Barentine, Lost Constellations, 352-54). The
                     rivalry persisted in Ruskin's time, when an 1820s British astronomy manual bitterly
                     mocked an attempt to rename a portion of the constellation <span class="name">Orion</span> after <span class="persName">Napoleon</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Aspin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span> (2d ed., <span class="date">1825</span>)</a>, 147; see <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#ORIONGLOSS"><span class="name">Orion</span>, contextual gloss</a>).</p>
                  <p>Another rivalry between British and French popular science, while not directly related
                     to astronomy, was in the news when <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> was composing "The Constellations" and may have animated his choice to name the constellation
                     <span class="name">Camelopardalis (the Giraffe)</span>, although he assigns it no contextualizing epithet. In <span class="date">1827–28</span>, the first living specimen of a giraffe was imported to <span class="placeName">Britain</span>, an event that spurred competition with <span class="placeName">France</span>, which also received a specimen (see <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#CAMELOPARDALISGLOSS"><span class="name">Camelopardalis</span>, contextual gloss</a>). What appears a preference for constellations representing animals, birds, and fabulous
                     beasts among <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs choices may have been prompted by the opening of the <span class="placeName">London Zoo</span> in <span class="date">March 1828</span>.</p>

                     the Creator through recitation of relevant scripture by chapter and verse; rather,
                     perhaps more significantly, the poem broaches a religious problem by wrestling with
                     a <a class="link_ref" href="HISTORY-VIRTUE">tension between "virtue" and "history"</a>. In its initial form, the poem was not conspicuously religious; however, in working

                     Ruskin's poem, no Biblical allusions--much less quotations, with chapter and verse--were
                     suggested by his poetic epithets. Only with the constellation Ara (the Altar), which
                     Margaret Ruskin flagged for revision, did he substitute a descriptive epithet that
                     could be read as a Biblical allusion or typological prompt (see the contextual gloss
                     for Ara; and for other Christian typological interpretations of pagan myths associated
                     with certain constellations, which were highlighted by Aspin in A Familiar Treatise

                  <p>While <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> cannot avoid the mythical names of the constellations, she suppresses the myths themselves,
                     defining the constellations neutrally as “remarkable groups or clusters of stars,
                     to which names of various figures have been given”. She does not pursue the identity
                     of the figures or their stories, presumably fearing that a fascination with the myths
                     approaches idolatry, as suggested by a quotation from <span class="titlem">Chronicles</span>: “For great is the <span class="persName">Lord</span>, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods
                     of the people are idols: the Lord made the heavens” (<span class="titlem">1 Chron 16</span>: 25–26). Instead, <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> directs admiration of the stars toward Christian praise: “We find in Scripture the
                     glory of the righteous in the resurrection compared to that of the stars; by which

                     “The names and figures are of very ancient date, and are still retained for the sake
                     of distinction, as well as to avoid confusion in comparing ancient with modern observations”

This functional justification does not prevent <span class="persName">Aspin</span> from summarizing each of the “fables” associated with each of the constellations—summaries
                     that are keyed to the cards depicting the mythical figures, which are the primary
                     selling point of <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span></span>. <span class="persName">Aspin</span> tempers the paganism of the stories, however, by regularly interpreting the figures

                  <p>In <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, the largely random order in which the constellations are named suggests that
                     he had so far neglected understanding of these basic astronomical concepts, and <span class="persName">Lucy</span>ʼs drills a year later in <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III”</span> indicate limited advance since the lessons only double the memorization task. While
                     the poem begins logically by naming “northern” constellations, fixing on the familiar
                     circumpolar group, thereafter the sequence darts around the celestial globe, naming
                     “some” in the north, “some” in the south, and “some” in the <span class="name">zodiac</span>. Associative connections, if any, are thematic rather than scientific, such as his
                     abrupt plunges into the southern hemisphere, motivated apparently by a patriotic desire
                     to name a constellation that bears a British association (see Patriotic Astronomical
                     Education). Occasionally the sequence of naming is clustered within a circumscribed
                     region of the sky, but on the whole <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> subordinates scientific logic to aesthetic pleasure. As he declares in a caveat added
                     as a note to the second fair copy (<span class="titlem">MS III</span>): “These constellations though they are next in this poetry are not next in the sky”.</p>
                  <p>The belated addition of that note to the second fair copy does suggest, however, that
                     <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> was at least gaining awareness of what he lacked in basic understanding of astronomical
                     science. <span class="persName">Lucy</span>ʼs memorization drills in <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III”</span> are dull compared to dreaming up poetic epithets in <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, but the constellation lists in <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span> follow a more organized pattern compared to the poemʼs random naming, proceeding
                     generally from the north to the south on the celestial globe. This gain in organization,
                     while revealing little about what <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> may have learned conceptually over the intervening year about astronomical science,
                     perhaps registers a tempering of aesthetic glee with systematic learning. The approach
                     remains invested in the memorization exercises for lacks the specifically religious
                     aims and praise of the <span class="persName">Creator</span> emphasized in <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs scheme, the poem does share with her primer an emotional stir, and even that enthusiasm
                     seems to drop out of the later lessons for <span class="persName">Lucy</span>. Perhaps <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs astronomical education remained conflicted over the problem that arose when revising
                     the poemʼs conclusion in the <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> fair copy. In the revisions to the first fair copy, the praise of “virtue”—the closest
                     that <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> comes to <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs praise of the <span class="persName">Creator</span> in scripture quotations—is bound up with a problem of how to reconcile “history”
                     with Christian “knowledge”; and “history” appears to have included familiarity with
                     pagan myth, which <span class="persName">Margaret</span> flagged with ×s to be replaced or revised. One year later, in <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III”</span>, “knowledge” appears to have gained neither conventional piety nor poetic expression
                     in <span class="persName">Lucy</span>ʼs star lists (see <a class="link_ref" href="#MYTHS" title="Knowledge versus Christian Faith The Problem of Mythology">Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology</a>).</p>

                     While <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs, <span class="persName">Day</span>ʼs, and <span class="persName">Maria Edgeworth</span>ʼs books are proven influences, their books refer to only a handful of the constellations
                     named in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem. The addition of a tabular source like <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs, combined with <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs imagination, could account for the whole, but <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> hints at a still larger context of early Victorian astronomical instruction in the
                     form of lectures, toys, and just real‐life observation. Did <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> engage in actual stargazing as preparation for any part of the poem? Does the poem
                     reflect conditions of British astronomoical practice and popular education in the
                     <span class="date">1820s</span>? Evidence is limited, but the introduction to astronomy provided by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs books itself pointed to the theatrical and real‐life entertainments that were readily
                     available to youth.</p>

                     <p>After , <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> arrives at the <span class="name">Zodiac</span>, as also mentioned in his title, which may hint at another context for his interest
                        in astronomy. As a distinct activity from professional astronomy with its mathematical
                        orientation combined with observation—the less popularly accessible approach, which
                        <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Tutor</span> encourages over the mythological tradition—there thrived in the <span class="date">1820s</span> a popular form of astronomy education, which combined technology with art, modern
                        science with traditional elements such as the <span class="name">Zodiac</span>. The popular astronomy lecture was a theatrical entertainment, commonly known as
                        Lenten astronomy lectures since they could be held in <span class="placeName">London</span> theaters during the holy season, when plays were forbidden. The timing of these spectacles
                        fits with the proposed <span class="date">April–June 1828</span> period for composition of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, which might have been initiated by attendance at a lecture. (In <span class="date">1828</span>, Easter Day fell on <span class="date">6 April</span>. <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span>ʼs accounts for <span class="date">April 1828</span> include “Abernethys Lect<sup>rs</sup>” for 12<span style="font-style:italic">s</span>, but this entry probably refers to published lectures by the surgeon, <span class="persName">John Abernethy</span> [<span class="date">1764–1831</span>]; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><span class="titlem">Account Book</span></a>, 6r).</p>
                     <p>The astronomy lecture circuit—originating in the <span class="date">late eighteenth century</span>, becoming a craze in the <span class="date">1820s</span>, and remaining a staple of popular science instruction at least until <span class="date">mid—century</span>—has been researched by <span class="persName">Hsiang—Fu Huang</span>, who finds that its performative and entrepreneurial aspects overlapped with the
                        insitutional framework of lecturing that was supposedly displacing these popular forms
                        of instruction in the <span class="date">1820s</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HUANGSHAREDARENA"><span class="persName">Huang</span>, <span class="titlem">“A Shared Arena”</span></a>). A target audience for the lectures included children, as <span class="persName">Huang</span> notes (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HUANGURANIA"><span class="titlem">“When Urania Meets Terpsichore”</span></a>, 60–61), astronomy being regarded as an uplifting area of knowledge religiously as
                        well as scientifically. As a guidebook of <span class="placeName">London</span> amusements solemnly assured parents about the content of Lenten astronomy lectures—even
                        as performed by <span class="persName">George Bartley</span> (<span class="date">1784–1858</span>), who was not a scientist but a comic actor, famed for his portrayals of <span class="persName">Shakespeare</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Falstaff</span>—the spectacle would convey “to the minds of their children the lofty and magnificent
                        ideas that Astronomy supplies”—namely,</p>

                     <p>Even as educational entertainments for children, however, the Lenten astronomy lectures
                        were regarded with some criticism by educators, as <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> would have known from <span class="persName">Maria Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank</span></span>. After <span class="persName">Frank</span> has attempted and failed on his own to construct an <span style="font-style:italic">orrery</span>, a model of the solar system, his parents take him and his cousin <span class="persName">Mary</span> to an astronomy lecture at a theater. The performance features something like the
                        large—scale, illuminated or “transparent” stage orreries with Greek—inspired names
                        like <span style="font-style:italic">Eidouranion</span>, which combined the older mechanical, three—dimensional orrery that reproduced the
                        revolutions of the sun and planets with transparancies projected by a magic lantern
                        (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HUANGURANIA"><span class="persName">Huang</span>, <span class="titlem">“When Urania Meets Terpsichore”</span></a>, 49–51, 66 n. 23). For <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>, criticism of these spectacles pertains not just to quack lecturers and creaky, dysfunctional
                        orreries, which <span class="persName">Huang</span> finds in satires of the day (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HUANGURANIA"><span class="titlem">“When Urania Meets Terpsichore”</span></a>, 62–63); more fundamentally, <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span> points to conflicts with reformersʼ principles of effective pedagogy.</p>
                     <p>The theatrical spectacle is a grand but passive presentation, discouraging learning
                        through experience and self—discovery. Even though <span class="persName">Frank</span> had failed to complete his own orrery because he over—reached his abilities, the
                        stage orrery is “particularly interesting to <span class="persName">Frank</span>” thanks only to “the pains he had taken, and the various attempts he had made, to
                        understand and to represent” the revolving bodies. The other “little children” in
                        the audience went “dead asleep” and “even he”, <span class="persName">Frank</span>, “after all his reading in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span>, had much difficulty sometimes in understanding both the machine and the lecturer”.
                        <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs most severe criticism is aimed at the failure to scale knowledge to the age—appropriate
                        accessibility of young listeners. The lecturer overwhelms the audience “with a vast
                        number of words, which” <span class="persName">Frank</span> “strained his attention” to understand, trusting that the lengthy explanations “were
                        all necessary”, yet “of which nearly half were nothing to the purpose” and put <span class="persName">Mary</span> to sleep altogether. As for the <span class="placeName">London</span> guidebookʼs promise of the theatrical augmentation of Beauty, Order, and Sublimity,
                        it is the sight of the real moon on the ride home that prompts a spontaneous reaction
                        from <span class="persName">Mary</span>: “‘How beautiful!’ said she: ‘and how—’ sublime! she would have said, but she did
                        not know the word well enough: she knew the feeling.” <span style="font-style:italic">Feelings</span> are represented as accessible, regardless of age and learning; and despite <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs promotion of the Industrial Sublime in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</span></span>, here <span class="persName">Frank</span> responds to <span class="persName">Mary</span>ʼs admiration: “How wonderful! What is the orrery compared to this, <span class="persName">Mary</span>! . . . How grand! how different from any thing that the most ingenious man in this
                        world can make!” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank: A Sequel</span></span></a>, 2:251, 253, 255, 249, 256, 257).</p>
                     <p>The opposite effect on children was promised by promoters of astronomy as a theatrical
                        spectacle: astronomical science in particular, it was argued, benefits by the intervention
                        of art. According to the <span class="date">1826</span> guidebook, astronomy lectures are the epitome science enhanced of metropolitan “improvements
                        and amusements”:</p>

                        of the <span class="persName">Creator</span>, the accompanying engraving sets the machine in a “design of our own”—a moonlit natural

                           be to represent infinity! The stars, disposed in constellations, and surrounded by
                           concentric circles, may perhaps assist the imagination a little: The attempt in the

                           most distant fixed Star we can now see, even there, perhaps we should find ourselves
                           on the confines of creation, and see as many stars before us as we left behind! For
                           space has neither top nor bottom in it; it is a circle whose centre is every where,
                           but whose circumference is no where!” (pp. 36–37).</li>

                     <p>According to this description, the <span class="titlem">“Last Scene”</span>, at least as delivered by the Walker family, which by <span class="date">1828</span> had passed into the management of <span class="persName">Deane Franklin Walker</span> (<span class="date">1778–1865</span> [<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HUANGURANIA"><span class="persName">Huang</span>, <span class="titlem">“When Urania Meets Terpsichore”</span></a>, 50]), the most comprehensive view of the constellations was presented as the finale.
                        Could <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> have conceived of his poem as an ekphrastic version of this final, totalizing scene?
                        Apparently, in this show, a transparency exhibited a circle of the starry night, surrounded
                        by concentric rings to suggest infinitude. In an engraving by <span class="persName">I. Stow</span> (ca. <span class="date">1770–1823</span>), after <span class="persName">E. F. Burney</span> (<span class="date">1760–1848</span>), <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The proscenium of the English Opera House in the <span class="placeName">Strand</span>, (Late Lyceum.) as it appeared on the Evening of the <span class="date">21st March 1817</span>, with Walkerʼs Exhibition of the Eidouranion</span></span>, published by <span class="persName">Robert Wilkinson</span>, Scene 1 represented the earth and sun by turning the orbit vertically to the audience,
                        enclosing this revolution of the Eidouranion within a projection of an outer ring,
                        which showed the <span class="name">Zodiac</span> constellations. The <span class="name">Zodiac</span> constellations were represented by their respective mythological figures. Perhaps
                        the transparency for the Last Scene exhibited a similar ring of constellations in
                        their mythological guise, which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> in his way has reproduced.</p>
                     <p>The beginning of the poem, however, starts with a version of Scene 1 in the Walkersʼ
                        exhibition—or more precisely, a portion of their Scene 4—with the rising and setting
                        of <span class="name">Venus</span> and <span class="name">Mars</span>. As noted earlier, the poem is atypical of <span class="persName">Day</span>ʼs and <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs introductions to the constellations, which begin with finding the circumpolar constellations
                        in the sky. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> incorporates that observation as the second stage of his poem. The <span class="name">Zodiac</span> constellations form a distinct piece within the poem. The most significant point
                        to draw from the context of the Lenten astronomy lectures is that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs catalogue may have attempted a sublime totality, an expression of religious awe.</p>
