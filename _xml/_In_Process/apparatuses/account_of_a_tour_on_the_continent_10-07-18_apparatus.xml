                    <p>In <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)</ref>, 
                        <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> printed the title, 
                        <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</title>, without square brackets, his symbol for declaring editorial intervention. 
                        Nonetheless, the title apparently originated with him, as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> assigned no title to the 
                        sequence as a whole in any of the extant manuscripts 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>, 1:119, 281;

                        Accordingly, in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, when the main title is fully spelled out, it is given without quotation 
                        marks, in keeping with the guidelines given in <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="title_citation_note.php">The System of Title Citation for Works</ref>. 
                        In commentary about the work, however, for convenience in the course of discussion, a short title is used with quotation marks (i.e., the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>) 
                        in order to avoid confusion with surrounding text.</p>
                    <p>It is possible that the fair copy of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> 
                        once held a title or at least a page designated for one, but that the evidence has been lost owing to the manner of the manuscript&#x02BC;s curation. 
                        According to an annotation in the hand of <persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName>, after the time when <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> 
                        first described the manuscript (around <date when="1890">1890</date>) &#x201C;blank pages&#x201D; were &#x201C;removed&#x201D; (see <ref type="internal" target="MAJORMS">Manuscripts</ref>). 
                        There remains in the manuscript a blank page (11r) followed by a stub of a leaf where a title for the 
                        <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> might logically have been placed 
                        (see also <ref type="apparatus" target="msix_apparatus.php#DESCRIPTION"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>: Description</ref>).</p>
                    <p>In another, more minor discrepancy respecting the editorial title for the work as a whole, both 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)</ref> and the 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php">Library Edition</ref> cite the title in their respective tables of contents as

                        the extension containing the date

                    <p>What titles <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did supply refer only to individual verse and prose sections of the work. In the initial stage of composition, 
                        when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears to have conceived the work as a sequence solely in verse 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>), the titles in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title> 
                        referred to individual poems, each named for the place described in the poem. Later, when he expanded the work by adding prose essays 
                        and graphic illustrations, these initial titles became section headings, each now naming the place which in most cases is described with a poem, a prose essay, and drawings.</p>
                    <p>When two selections from the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> were published in the literary annual, 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title></ref>, in late <date when="1834">1834</date> 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>), 
                        the selections were subsumed together under the title, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRFRAGMENTS">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</title> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath . . . for MDCCCXXXV</hi></title></ref>, 317&#x2013;19). 
                        The responsibility for assigning this title is unknown.</p>
                    <p>Because the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> is incomplete, and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> failed to entitle several of the individual verse and prose pieces drafted in 
                        <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> (and even neglected entitling the last two sections he compiled as fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>), 
                        <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> invented titles for the untitled verse that he included in his arrangement of the work; 
                        and the editors of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> followed suit. In both editions, these titles are indicated as editorial using square brackets, 
                        but this practice was not carried out consistently. Some of these editorial titles are very convincingly what <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had in mind, based on internal evidence; 
                        others were probably a guess. The editors appear not to have made studious use of the most authoritative source of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s titles for sections he left incomplete or undrafted&#x2014;his 
                        <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php"><title type="bibliography_text" corresp="JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">List of Proposed Additional Contents for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        which he compiled on the back endboard of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> at about the time he abandoned composition of the work.</p>
                    <p>Since the earlier editors&#x02BC; speculative titles have become familiar, in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> these are supplied in square brackets following a first&#x2010;line title.

                    <p>Composite verse and prose travelogue, illustrated with drawings in imitation of published engravings and lithographs.</p>
                    <p>As proposed in <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName> appear originally to have conceived the genre 
                        of the work as a travelogue solely in verse&#x2014;a version represented by a manuscript now bound in <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title></ref>, 
                        and designated in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> as

                        The work returned to this characterization as an all&#x2010;verse travelogue, when selections were excerpted and revised under the title,

                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#TITLE">Title</ref>). By this time, however, the scenario of a

                        On a slip with this printed description pasted onto it, which is tipped between the front endpapers of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>,

                        being devoted to the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>: &#x201C;Most of the blank pages have been removed &#x0026; the book replaced in its old cover&#x201D;. 
                        (<persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> does not identify the responsibility or explain the purpose for this treatment. His use of passive voice leaves open the possibility 
                        that someone besides himself was responsible&#x2014;<persName corresp="#JAS">Joan Severn</persName>, for example, who owned the manuscript&#x2014;and therefore one cannot necessarily 
                        take him at his word that the removed pages were completely blank.) Since <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> does not specify 
                        (and may not have known) specifically which &#x201C;blank pages&#x201D; were removed, evidence may have been destroyed of how many blank leaves 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have left in various places to allow for insertion of text and/or drawings in portions of the 
                        <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> that he left incomplete.</p>
                    <p>As explained in <ref type="apparatus" target="msix_apparatus.php#DESCRIPTION"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>: Description</ref>, remaining stubs 
                        suggest that the removed pages did not necessarily form a continuous segment of the original notebook, but may have included leaves taken from between blocks 
                        of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s text. Drawings may also have been detached from their original positions where they were pasted between blocks of text and resituated. 
                        Rearrangement of drawings seems especially likely in the case of the gallery of untitled drawings that presently follows the page on which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                        abandoned his fair copy of the text. He may have assembled this gallery himself after he gave up expectation of completing the fair copy, but it seems at least equally probable 
                        that he originally placed the drawings on pages, now removed, where he planned for surrounding text.</p>
                    <p>Context was also lost respecting manuscripts bound in <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title></ref>, 
                        which contains two manuscripts associated with the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>&#x2014;those 
                        designated in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> as 
                        <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</ref>, and 
                        <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g2.php">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</ref>.
                        These manuscripts were not originally contained in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, but were collected and bound along 
                        with other miscellaneous manuscripts by the editors of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php">Library Edition</ref> (see <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php#PROVENANCE">MS IA: Provenance</ref>). 
                        Prior to this arrangement, <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> was familiar with these two manuscripts when editing the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, 
                        as indicated by various textual details in his copytext of poems published 
                        in <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> (1891)</ref>. 
                        He did not, however, document where and in what state he originally found them, and any such context was lost 
                        when they were later bound with the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> miscellany.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> also largely neglected to identify the source of his copytext for particular poems. 
                        Apart from his general rule of adopting copytext from previously published versions, where available (a rule that applied to only three poems from 
                        the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>), he drew on what he vaguely designated as &#x201C;originals&#x201D;. 
                        His sources can be reconstructed easily enough; for example, <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g2.php">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</ref>, 
                        is the sole extant source of two poems, <ref type="witness" target="passing_the_alps_poem_msia_g2.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title></ref> 
                        and <ref type="witness" target="milan_cathedral_poem_msia_g2.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRMILANCATHEDRAL">&#x201C;Milan Cathedral&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        both of which are included in <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s version of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>. 
                        In the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>, for all its dependency on the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)</ref>, 
                        <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> were more attentive than <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>  
                        in documenting the manuscript sources used for copytext or to identify variants. For example, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> 
                        rewrites a line of the poem <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</title>, justifying the innovation by what he considers &#x201C;neither rhyme nor reason&#x201D; 
                        in an unidentified &#x201C;original&#x201D; (i.e., MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1). The faulty line, he decides, is a mis&#x2010;transcription of a line from a &#x201C;rough copy, now lost&#x201D;, 
                        the existence of which is entirely suppositious, but which he declares to have been somehow &#x201C;insufficiently altered&#x201D;. 
                        The editors of the the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> 
                        reject <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s rewritten line, finding merit in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;father&#x02BC;s copy&#x201D; of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</title> 
                        (i.e., MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1, which is partly in the hand of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, with interlinear revisions by <persName corresp="JR">John</persName>), 
                        and they cross&#x2010;check the line with <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;fair copy&#x201D; (MS IX)

                    <p><persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s editorial approach to the &#x201C;<title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account</title>&#x201D; and its manuscripts values editorial intervention over documentary text, 
                        even though he cherishes manuscripts. Throughout the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><date when="1891">1891</date> <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title></ref>, 
                        he consistently awards priority and adheres faithfully to previously published versions of texts&#x2014;in the case of copytext for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, 
                        deferring to earlier editors&#x02BC; interventions that resulted in texts as published in <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php"><title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title></ref> 
                        and <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1850_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1850"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1850)</title></ref>. 
                        He pays comparatively little deference to texts as found in manuscripts, allowing himself latitude that presumably was taken by his predecessors, 
                        and holding himself to an editorial principle that can at best be summarized as aesthetic preference. Creative writing is justified, 
                        if he can discern &#x201C;neither rhyme nor reason&#x201D; in a line, and the design of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891">1891 <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> rules over the reconstruction of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, 
                        which is presented as a work solely in verse, despite <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s intentions for a composite verse, prose, and graphic work, as reflected in his fair copy. 
                        <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> labored to construct an accurate manuscript chronology in the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS of the Poems&#x201D;</title>, 
                        resulting in a deservedly influential document in the history of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> editing and manuscript curation, but his concept of an &#x201C;original manuscript&#x201D; 
                        entailed no responsibility to apply that chronology meaningfully to the editing of a given work by reconstructing its compositional history.</p>
                    <p>Thus, in editing the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> drew the main copytexts of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRANDERNACHT">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</title> and 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSTGOAR">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</title> from their publication as <title type="poem" corresp="#JRFRAGMENTS">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</title>, 
                        subordinating their manuscript texts to endnotes containing what he calls their &#x201C;first sketch&#x201D; or &#x201C;first draft&#x201D; (the terms are apparently interchangeable), 
                        conceding that &#x201C;it may be interesting to compare the two versions&#x201D; (manuscript and publication) in order to show, &#x201C;if for nothing else, . . . that the young poet could polish when he chose, 
                        and that he would have eliminated the slipshod grammar and faulty rhymes if he had prepared the rest of his juvenile verses for publication&#x201D;. 
                        It seems not to have struck <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> that the interest in comparing published and manuscript versions lay, not in copyediting corrections (<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s manuscript texts, draft or fair copy, contain remarkably few errors of this kind), 
                        but in differences of diction, economy, and the respective projects to which the versions belonged. The term <hi rend="italic">first sketch</hi> or <hi rend="italic">first draft</hi> 
                        belies the manuscript versions of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRANDERNACHT">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</title> and 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSTGOAR">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</title>, which are not &#x201C;slipshod&#x201D; sketches or drafts but exacting fair copies&#x2014;the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> versions 
                        transcribed in a &#x201C;copperplate&#x201D; hand directly or indirectly from the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title>, versions, 
                        a manuscript that itself appears to be a presentation copy (purpose unknown). Regardless, for <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>, the varieties of manuscript textual witness 
                        collapse into &#x201C;originals&#x201D; versus &#x201C;polished&#x201D; versions, the former disarmed of textual authority and open to seemingly limitless editorial intervention, 
                        and the latter given unquestioned authority though abstracted from the social history of editors, publishers, and printers that bestowed the authority in the first place 
                        (what <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> supposedly would have wrought for himself, had he &#x201C;chose&#x201D;)

                    <p>In place of this missing textual history, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s edition substitutes a documentary history of artifacts, a &#x201C;study of these ancient Codices, 
                        and of their Pal&#x00E6;ography&#x201D;, resulting in &#x201C;a complete sequence of the phases of Mr. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s handwriting from the earliest period&#x201D;. 
                        The paleography, witnessed in the edition by photogravures of specimens of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s boyhood hand, is meant to pique the &#x201C;curiosity&#x201D; of collectors, 
                        those who want &#x201C;to collect [<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s] boyish writings and to learn the story of his youth&#x201D;. Possession of these physical specimens 
                        imparts the illusion of a textual history, satisfying &#x201C;a peculiar interest in watching development, in witnessing growth&#x201D;

                        Just as important as the physical manuscripts for <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>, as records of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand, are the drawings. To embellish his edition of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, however, 
                        <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> passed over the obvious choice of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s handmade illustrations for the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copy, drawn in the manner of steel&#x2010;engraved vignettes, 
                        in favor of pencil sketches taken during the <date when="1833">1833</date> tour. For <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>, the correlative of a &#x201C;first sketch&#x201D; manuscript poem 
                        was a picturesque sketch taken on the spot; and an &#x201C;original&#x201D;, in word or picture, meant an experience. Ultimately, the story of &#x201C;development&#x201D; 
                        that he wishes to tell is the persistent presence of that experience (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>).</p>

                        <p>None of the manuscripts is dated by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>. Presumably, a terminus a quo for composition is established by 
                            the family&#x02BC;s departure for the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName> shortly after <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s

                            Neither of these possible termini a quo can be ruled out by the physical evidence of what is likely the earliest extant manuscript,

                            This manuscript, which is in the hands of both father and son, conceivably could date even from the journey itself 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>).</p>

                            that date would fall a few days after <date notBefore="1833-09-19" notAfter="1833-09-30">19 September 1833</date>, which was the date when the family reached

                            A few more days would have been required in order to transact business and cross the <geogName corresp="#ENGLISHCHANNEL">Channel</geogName> at

                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> ceased steady work on his composition and fair copy of the

                        <p>Some very tenuous evidence exists that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> extended work on the project until much later into the year,

                            description of a distant view of the city resembles features in an engraved view of the subject based on a drawing by

                            an engraving that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> could not have seen prior to its publication in <date when="1834-09">September 1834</date> 
                            (see the gloss on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s description of the cathedral towers in

                            However, the similarity between <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s prospects 
                            could be coincidental, whereas the evidence for dating the draft of this prose section of <title type="essay" corresp="#BRUSSELSPROSE">&#x201C;Brussels&#x201D;</title>, 
                            which occurs in <ref type="apparatus" target="msviii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title></ref>, 
                            weighs heavily in favor of an earlier date, between <date when="1834-02">February</date> and <date when="1834-05">May 1834</date>.</p>
                        <p>If the versions of the first five poems of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> in

                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msviii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title></ref> can be associated with the terminus ad quem in <date when="1834-08">August 1834</date>, 
                            by which time <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had abandoned composition and fair&#x2010;copying for publication 
                            (no witness survives of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s draft revision of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRFRAGMENTS">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</title>), 
                            the stint of draft of <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> in <ref type="apparatus" target="msviii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title></ref> 
                            falls naturally in between these points. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> probably started this <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php">MS VIII draft</ref> around 
                            the time of his <date when="1834-02-08">8 February 1834 birthday</date>, when he received certain books that can be associated with the onset of this draft 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>). This important stint&#x2014;which consists largely of first drafts of poems 
                            relating to the Alpine and Italian stages of the tour, along with draft of prose that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was simultaneously folding 
                            along with the earlier&#x2010;composed poems on the Belgian and German stages into the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copy&#x2014;can therefore be dated approximately 
                            between his fifteenth birthday on <date when="1834-02-08">8 February</date> and his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName>&#x02BC;s forty&#x2010;ninth birthday on <date when="1834-05-10">10 May</date>.</p>
                        <p>The evidence of overlap between <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s activities of drafting in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> 
                            and fair&#x2010;copying in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> yields somewhat narrower dating. In the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft, 
                            the fact that the fifteenth and seventeenth items in the sequence form draft of the prose essay, <ref type="witness" target="brussels_prose_msviii.php"><title type="essay" corresp="#JRBRUSSELSPROSE">&#x201C;Brussels&#x201D;</title></ref> 
                            suggests that by this point <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> 
                            the full composite sections of verse, prose, and drawings for <title type="composite" corresp="#JRCALAISCOMP">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</title>, &#x201C;<title type="composite" corresp="#JRCASSELCOMP">Cassel&#x201D;</title>,

                            These first sixteen pages of fair copy and inserted drawings, while a complex undertaking, do not represent an enormous labor, so it is conceivable that 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> started work on the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copy very near the onset of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft.</p>

                            terminates physically up against a recto page containing draft of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s ekphrastic and topographical poem,

                            Because <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> dated this poem from toward the end (<date notBefore="1835-10-12" notAfter="1835-12-10">October&#x2010;December</date>)

                            on a page of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> that he had left blank following the <date when="1833">1833</date> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] draft of the

                            Its placement at the point where the <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php">MS VIII &#x201C;Account&#x201D; draft</ref>

                        <p>The more elusive date is when the Ruskins acquired the <date when="1830">1830</date> edition of 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY1830"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>. The question is of some interest, since, 
                            as argued in <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> underwent a development similar to that of

                            from an all&#x2010;verse to a composite&#x2010;genre work. In the autobiography, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> admits that he has &#x201C;told this story so often&#x201D; about the influence of 
                            <persName corresp="#SR">Roger</persName>&#x02BC;s book and its revelation of <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s art, 
                            &#x201C;that I begin to doubt its time&#x201D;. In <title type="book" corresp="JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>&#x02BC;s 
                            typically dramatizing fashion, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> declares that &#x201C;the main tenor of my life&#x201D; was set on 
                            <date when="1832-02-08">8 February 1832</date> by the birthday gift from his father&#x02BC;s business partner,

                            &#x201C;It is curiously tiresome that Mr. <persName corresp="#HT">Telford</persName> did not himself write my name in the book, 
                            and my father, who writes in it, &#x2018;The gift of <persName corresp="#HT">Henry Telford</persName>, Esq.,&#x2019;  
                            still more curiously, for him, puts no date: if it was a year later [i.e., <date when="1833-02-08">8 February 1833</date>], no matter&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 35:79).</p>
                        <p>In fact, the date range for acquaintance with <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> is even wider. 
                            In a non&#x2010;illustrated edition, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s poem had been in the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> household 
                            since <date when="1828">1828</date> at the latest (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 188 n. 4).
                            This happens to be the year when <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> published &#x201C;Part the Second&#x201D; of the poem; 
                            and growing disgusted over the work&#x02BC;s tepid reception, he bought out remaining copies of both that volume and &#x201C;Part the First&#x201D;, and destroyed them 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROGERSITALY1828">Rogers, <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> [1828]</ref>; 
                            <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROGERSITALY1823">Rogers, <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> [1823]</ref>;

                            Thus, even before <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s poem achieved popularity in the illustrated edition, 
                            the Ruskins could count themselves among the select number of appreciative readers of the work in its original form; 
                            and it is possible that <persName corresp="#HT">Telford</persName>&#x02BC;s gift of the <date when="1830">1830</date> edition contributed to the family&#x02BC;s travel plans even earlier than <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> remembered. 
                            The first mention of &#x201C;our Switzerlandish outlandish tour to Italy&#x201D; occurs in the family letters for <date when="1831-03">March 1831</date>, 
                            a month after <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s twelfth birthday (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 253).</p>
                        <p>More significant than the year when <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s work first helped to shape expectations for the journey, however, 
                            is a confirmation of its special influence immediately following the family&#x02BC;s return from the Continent. 
                            According to <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName>, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> purchased a copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> 
                            in <date when="1833-10">October 1833</date>, notably soon after the family&#x02BC;s <date when="1833-09">September</date> return home 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 286 n. 1).
                            Actually, the October entry in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s personal accounts ledger records a purchase that was germane specifically 
                            to the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> rather than to the Continental tour generally. 
                            The entry reads &#x201C;Plates Italy 28/6&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, Account Book [1827&#x2013;45]</ref>, 29v); 
                            and although the lack of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s name renders identification uncertain, 
                            the term <hi rend="italic">plates</hi> and the cost&#x2014;higher than the 1 &#x00A3;/1 s. cost of a copy of the <date when="1830">1830</date> <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY1830"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> in paper boards&#x2014;strongly suggest a portfolio of its plates alone. 
                            As <persName corresp="#JPSCHOLAR">Jan Piggott</persName> explains, &#x201C;the publishers of almost all the books illustrated with <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName> vignettes 
                            made the engravings better known and made more profit by selling portfolios of prints from the plates. These were available in ranks of quality and price: 
                            engraver&#x02BC;s proofs; on India paper; before and after lettering; and on varying sizes of paper&#x2014;even on the absurdly large Colombier folio&#x2014;to satisfy the competitiveness of connoissures&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PIGGOTTTURNERSVIGNETTES"><title type="book" corresp="PIGGOTTTURNERSVIGNETTES"><hi rend="italic">Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes</hi></title></ref>, 24). 
                            While <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s strictly poetic influence on the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> was certainly considerable 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#ROGERSINFLUENCEONEXTENSION">The Influence of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s Poetry on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s Planned Extension of the Composite&#x2010;Genre Travelogue to <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName></ref>), 
                            it was the ekphrastic influence of book illustration by <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>, <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>, 
                            <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>, and others, and the materiality of the print culture conveying their artistry, that particularly inspired <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s project, 
                            especially its expansion into a composite&#x2010;genre, illustrated version&#x2014;an expansion that mimics <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s own reconception of his work.</p>

                            He neglected to account for the fact that the title pages of <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">annuals</ref>

                            In addition, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> was befuddled by his assumption that the second poem by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>

                            not on first&#x2010;hand experience, but, like many writers commissioned to supply letterpress for the annuals, on an acquaintance with a place that extended no farther 
                            than the engraved vedute that they were hired to complement with their writing, and on whatever information they could glean from published sources.

                    <p>Along the way, the reader is occasionally referred to textual and contextual glosses that hang from the transcripts of certain witnesses, 
                        elaborating what particular poems, essays, or drawings, or clusters of pieces, reveal about literary and artistic influences and compositional strategies.</p>
                    <p>The analysis is supported by <ref type="internal" target="#APPARATUSTABLE1">Table 1</ref> listing the sequential contents of each of the manuscripts, 
                        and the contents of the published versions of the work. The table also tracks <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s system of

                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> left the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> incomplete, 
                        abandoning the fair copy in mid&#x2010;sentence, with much existing draft remaining to be incorporated, and much more proposed composition to be undertaken 
                        according to his grand scheme for extension of the work (<ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii_contents.php"><title type="bibliography_text" corresp="JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">List of Proposed Additional Contents for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title></ref>). 
                        Arguably, however, the work should be viewed less as the &#x201C;unfinished folly&#x201D; that 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> retrospectively mocked in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> 
                        and more as a project exhibiting his rapid development as a writer (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 35:81). 
                        The manuscripts show a work undergoing transformations, with each stage of development displacing the former. The <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> 
                        served its purpose by repeatedly capping its goals until the project was rendered obsolete by publication of poems derived from it, which announced the emergence of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        first significant public persona, <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">&#x201C;J.R.&#x201D;</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The hypothesis advanced here is that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> developed the work in fairly distinct stages, from a verse travelogue 
                        in the eighteenth&#x2010;century topographical manner&#x2014;as represented by <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title>, 
                        a collaboration with <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x2014;to a composite&#x2010;genre, illustrated travelogue that reflected the material culture 
                        surrounding the ekphrastic and travel&#x2010;related publishing of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>. 
                        Finally, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> found himself being brought forward as a published author, credited with two works in the fashionable 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">literary and artistic annual</ref>,

                        To form one of these published works, <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRFRAGMENTS">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        he revised a pair of poems selected from <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>. The title suggests a reversion 
                        to the initial conception of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> as a verse sequence. To form the second work, 
                        the topographical and travel poem, <ref type="apparatus" target="saltzburg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        he did not adapt material directly from the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, but he deployed strategies learned from the ekphrastic and composite&#x2010;genre character 
                        of the work&#x02BC;s advanced stage of composition. Draft of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title> also reveals <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                        venturing to define a persona behind the initials <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">J.R.</persName> attached to the published poems.</p>

                        <p>Apparently reflecting a collaboration, the manuscript is in the hands of both <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> and <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, 
                            and contains a fair copy, with corrections, of five poems, which sequentially narrate the family&#x02BC;s first stage of their journey, 
                            taking them through northern <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName>. 
                            Each poem is entitled by a significant destination along this route: <ref type="witness" target="calais_poem_msia_g1.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</title></ref>,

                            No title identifies the sequence as an entity.</p>
                        <p>The case for this manuscript as the earliest extant piece of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> project is based on the fact that 
                            its in&#x2010;line and interlinear insertions, deletions, substitutions, transposition of lines, and other revisions are incorporated into the 
                            <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copies of these poems (see, e.g., the textual and contextual glosses attached to the transcripts of the five poems), 
                            and on the fact that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s sequence of drafting the prose essays that correspond to the five poems, as witnessed in the 
                            <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft, necessarily situates the <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title> texts 
                            as existing prior to both the drafts and the fair copies of these essays (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPOSITEILLUSTRATEDTRAVELOGUEDRAFT">Drafting the Composite&#x2010;Genre Travelogue [MS VII, VIII, XI]</ref>).</p>
                        <p>I interpret this manuscript as witnessing an all&#x2010;verse version of the travelogue, composed with some degree of collaboration by father and son. 
                            As discussed in <ref type="internal" target="#DATEOFCOMPOSITION">Date of Composition</ref>, the manuscript is undated, and it remains an open question whether it was composed during 
                            the <date notBefore="1833-05" notAfter="1833-09">May&#x2013;September 1833</date> journey itself, or following the family&#x02BC;s return home around <date when="1833-09-20">20 September</date>.</p>
                        <p>The recto of sheet 1 of the manuscript begins with the poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</title>, entitled as such, 
                            and in the hand of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>. On the verso, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> continued with the poem, 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCASSEL">[&#x201C;Cassel&#x201D;]</title> (untitled, and therefore identifiable as a new poem following 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</title> only on the grounds of the two poems&#x02BC; separation in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> 
                            fair copy). At line 19 of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCASSEL">[&#x201C;Cassel&#x201D;]</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s hand takes over 
                            (not <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s, whose terminal letters are typically formed differently than what prevails here). 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> carries the poem onto sheet 2 of the manuscript (evidence, along with their physical similarity, that the two sheets 
                            form a single manuscript), filling recto and verso with the continuation of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCASSEL">[&#x201C;Cassel&#x201D;]</title>, 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#JRLILLE">&#x201C;Lille&#x201D;</title>, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRBRUSSELS">&#x201C;Brussels&#x201D;</title>, and 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMEUSE">&#x201C;The Meuse&#x201D;</title>.</p>
                        <p>The physical manuscript bears the appearance of a self&#x2010;standing fair copy, which was later subjected to revision. No other extant manuscript belonging to the 
                            <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> project consists solely of verse, and the arrangement of lines on the page indicates 
                            more care than in a draft. On sheet 1, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s large, eighteenth&#x2010;century hand takes up the full width for each line, 
                            and <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> sustained his father&#x02BC;s single column, but in narrower scope and a smaller hand; however, on the verso of sheet 2, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> stacked the lines in double columns, as if imitating printed verse (although he inserted the final poem in the sequence, 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMEUSE">&#x201C;The Meuse&#x201D;</title>, sideways in space remaining on the recto of sheet 2, 
                            rather than starting a third sheet). The few substitutions&#x2014;all apparently in <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s hand, 
                            although not certainly so, especially in the case of overwriting&#x2014;are mostly interlinear, made as strikethroughs with insertions above or below the line, 
                            with only a few instances as in&#x2010;line revisions, suggesting that these changes formed a distinct stage of this manuscript&#x02BC;s development, 
                            following its original purpose as a fair copy. Moreover, in the margins of both sheets, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> numbered the lines of the poems sequentially and continuously (1&#x2013;173); 
                            that is, he did not begin his line numbering anew with each poem, suggesting that he regarded the poems as forming a sequence.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> originally authored <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</title> 
                            and at least the first 18 lines of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCASSEL">[&#x201C;Cassel&#x201D;]</title>, which are in his hand, and that <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> 
                            thereafter took over the composition, revising some of his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName>&#x02BC;s lines in the process. This scenario cannot be absolutely proven, 
                            but neither can <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s assumption that sheet 1 of the manuscript 
                            bears witness to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;copy&#x201D; of <persName corresp="#JR">his son</persName>&#x02BC;s original verse 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, e.g. 2:341 n. 2). On the evidence of substitutions in 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s hand, it is notable that in&#x2010;line revisions occur solely in lines written originally in his hand, 
                            whereas his revisions of lines written originally in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hand occur solely as interlinear or overwriting, 
                            possibly suggesting that <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> had no part in a first stage of composing this sheet.</p>
                        <p>Further research is required to gauge the extent and nature of <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName> and <persName corresp="#JR">son</persName>&#x02BC;s collaboration. 
                            It is at least evident that the material witness of this manuscript indicates some degree of poetic collaboration by father and son, 
                            and it is noteworthy that this collaboration took place within the frame of the Augustan verse travelogues that prevailed in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s youth, 
                            rather than the manner of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>, <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>, <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName>, 
                            <persName corresp="#CJHD">Dickens</persName>, and the jobbing prose writers that dominated the scene during <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s first decade as an author

                        <p>The manuscript appears to be a semi&#x2010;fair copy, with corrections, and it is entirely in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand. 
                            The contents, unlike those of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title>, are non&#x2010;sequential relative to the actual tour, 
                            but they do appear selected to represent the major regions into which the tour&#x02BC;s itinerary was broadly divided. The contents also mix genres, 
                            introducing a prose essay, which is placed first in the group: <ref type="witness" target="calais_prose_msia.php"><title type="essay" corresp="#JRCALAISPROSE">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                            With this essay representing the tour&#x02BC;s point of entry to the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName> (as does the essay&#x02BC;s verse counterpart 
                            in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title>), there follow four poems, which seem to form two geographically related pairs: 
                            <ref type="witness" target="passing_the_alps_msia_g2.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title></ref> and

                            representing the southern and Alpine regions that occupied the second half of the tour; and 
                            <ref type="witness" target="andernacht_poem_msia.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRANDERNACHT">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</title></ref> and 
                            <ref type="witness" target="st_goar_poem_msia.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRSTGOAR">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                            representing the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> journey that occupied the first half. It is not clear why the manuscript positions the two pairs in a topographical order 
                            that is the reverse of the family&#x02BC;s encounter with these places, as they journeyed down the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> 
                            to the <geogName corresp="#BLACKFOREST">Black Forest</geogName>, and then crossed the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> and descended to the Italian lakes 
                            and <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName>.</p>
                        <p>This suggestion of an organizational feature is conjectural, as no title identifies the five pieces as an entity, and the purpose of the manuscript is unclear. 
                            I interpret the manuscript as a sample or abstract of the fully developed composite&#x2010;genre work, but the occasion that prompted its creation is unknown. 
                            The manuscript is undated, but it must have pre&#x2010;dated the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copy, 
                            which incorporates its corrections and substitutions in the prose essay, <title type="essay" corresp="#JRCALAISPROSE">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</title>, 
                            and in the poems <title type="poem" corresp="#JRANDERNACHT">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</title> and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSTGOAR">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</title>. 
                            The manuscript is the sole surviving witness for the other two poems, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title> and 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#JRMILANCATHEDRAL">&#x201C;Milan Cathedral&#x201D;</title>, the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copy 
                            having been abandoned toward the end of sections describing the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> journey, before the sequence could arrive at the 
                            crossing of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>. The manuscript&#x02BC;s place in the evolution of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> 
                            appears to be a transitional one between the all&#x2010;verse and the fully developed composite&#x2010;genre versions, 
                            since it contains not only a mix of genres (but no graphic illustrations) but also a selection of works about destinations that seems strategic. 
                            The audience and occasion of the manuscript will, however, probably always remain obscure.</p>
                        <p>The manuscript also holds keys to tracing the influence of <persName corresp="#SR">Samuel Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s poetry in 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, beyond the material influences of the volume&#x02BC;s 
                            organization, typography, and illustration. Although <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would develop these poetic influences more substantially afterward, in the 
                            <ref type="internal" target="#PROPOSEDCONTENTS">List of Proposed Additional Contents for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;</ref>, and in poems corresponding 
                            to that plan that he drafted in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#ROGERSINFLUENCEONEXTENSION">The Influence of Rogers&#x02BC;s Poetry on Ruskin&#x02BC;s Planned Extension of the Composite&#x2010;Genre Travelogue to Italy and Switzerland</ref>), 
                            the poem <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title> reveals that, at this earlier stage, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            made a study of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</title>. 
                            He borrowed and elaborated on <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s historical trope of <persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName> struggling 
                            against the &#x201C;barrier&#x201D; of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>, and he perceived how the trope could serve as a structural pivot 
                            in a work&#x02BC;s larger organization&#x2014;between north and south, mountain and plain, the sublime and the beautiful. It is also probably no accident 
                            that the manuscript reflects <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s classical principles of complementary contrast in the pairing of the gothic poem, 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#JRANDERNACHT">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</title>, with the domestic poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSTGOAR">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</title>. 
                            <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> may also contributed to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s idea of pairing poems with essays. 
                            While <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> contains only a few prose essays, and the work is not arranged in composite&#x2010;genre sections, 
                            <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s copious prose notes to the poems were as important to the author as his meticulous verse (see 
                            <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROGERSJOURNAL">Hale, introduction to <hi rend="italic">The Italian Journal of Samuel Rogers</hi></ref>, 49&#x2013;50). 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s voice in the prose avoids <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s pedantry and seriousness, however; 
                            and while <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> may have suggested strategies for multi&#x2010;genre complexity, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s models for the prose lay elsewhere in the livelier letterpress writers for the annuals and travel books.</p>
                        <p>In the ongoing process of composition of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG2">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</title> 
                            must have been a precursor not only to the fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> (in which the opening section incorporates the prose essay, 
                            <title type="essay" corresp="#JRCALAISPROSE">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</title>), but also to the draft of other poems and essays found in 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msviii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title></ref>. Yet the early occurrence of the two pairs of poems in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG2">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</title> 
                            dramatizes how these works served as imaginative and compositional cruxes for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>. The pairing of the poems, 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#JRANDERNACHT">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</title> and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSTGOAR">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</title>, 
                            was formed around a contrast of gothic sublime and domestic beauty, respectively, that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> carried forward to the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> 
                            fair copy (in which he elaborated the pairing with a third, middle section, <title type="composite" corresp="#JREHRENBREITSTEINCOMP">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D;</title>, 
                            designed to bridge the contrasting modes using a geographical analogy of a confluence of two rivers, the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> and the 
                            <geogName corresp="#MOSELLE">Moselle</geogName>). Ultimately, he refined the pairing for publication under the title, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRFRAGMENTS">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</title>. 
                            In the pairing of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title> and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRMILANCATHEDRAL">&#x201C;Milan Cathedral&#x201D;</title>, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> established another figure important to the development of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, 
                            that of crossing a divide between natural and supernatural phenomena. The figure of a crossing that is humanly transformative appears to have been suggested to him 
                            by <persName corresp="#SR">Samuel Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</title>, 
                            in <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPOSITEILLUSTRATEDTRAVELOGUEDRAFT">Drafting the Composite&#x2010;Genre Travelogue [MS VII, VIII, XI]</ref>;

                        <p>The two pairs of poems presented imaginative cruxes also in the process of drafting and fair-copying. In the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copy, 
                            the trio of composite&#x2010;genre sections, <title type="composite" corresp="#JRANDERNACHTCOMP">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</title>, <title type="composite" corresp="#JREHRENBREITSTEINCOMP">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D;</title>, 
                            and <title type="composite" corresp="#JRSTGOARCOMP">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</title>, were the last texts that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> completed, 
                            before abandoning the fair copy in the middle of the following section describing <title type="composite" corresp="#JRHEIDELBERGCOMP">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</title>. Oppositely, 
                            in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, the corresponding prose essays, <title type="essay" corresp="#JRANDERNACHTPROSE">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</title> and 
                            <title type="essay" corresp="#JRSTGOARPROSE">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</title>, occur very near the onset of this draft for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, 
                            even though the labor of assembling and fair&#x2010;copying these particular sections lay far ahead in the process 
                            (given that, in the sequence of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft, these prose essays are succeeded by other draft essays that 
                            would have to incorporated first into the fair copy before reaching these points on the lower <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>). 
                            Immediately after composing the prose essays, <title type="essay" corresp="#JRANDERNACHTPROSE">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</title> and 
                            <title type="essay" corresp="#JRSTGOARPROSE">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</title> near the start of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> dratft, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> turned from the figure of contrasting aesthetic modes to develop the figure of crossing in drafts relating to the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>&#x2014;i.e.,

                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s aim in the composite&#x2010;genre project clearly was to imitate the print culture of travel literature of his day. 
                            For the text, he used a cursive &#x201C;copperplate&#x201D; hand, justified left and right. For the page layout, he adopted the plan of the 
                            <date when="1830">1830</date> edition of <persName corresp="#SR">Samuel Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY1830"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, 
                            with a vignette&#x2010;style illustration placed at the top of the first page of each section, followed by the place&#x2010;name header (imitating even <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            choice of typeface and font), which serves to identify the section&#x02BC;s verse, prose, and additional illustrations&#x2014;all lacking titles of their own. In several instances, he drew illustrations in the manner of steel&#x2010;engravings, 
                            a new technology featured in <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY1830"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> (1830)</title> and 
                            <title type="book" corresp="#ROGERSPOEMS1834"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> (<date when="1834">1834</date>) as well as in the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">literary annuals</ref>. 
                            Specifically, he followed <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> in heading sections with vignettes of landscape subjects, adapted directly or drawn after the manner of <persName corresp="#JMWT">J. M. W. Turner</persName>, 
                            and in concluding sections with vignettes of figure subjects, drawn in the manner of <persName corresp="#TSP">Thomas Stothard</persName>. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            also copied illustrations directly from <persName corresp="#SP">Samuel Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s lithographs for the  
                            <title type="artwork" corresp="#PROUTSKETCHES"><hi rend="italic">Facsimiles of Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany</hi></title> (<date when="1833">1833</date>), 
                            and in at least one instance he attempted to capture the watery appearance of lithography in contrast to the stipled pen strokes he used to imitate engraving. In some headpiece vignettes, 
                            <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s influence competed with <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            choosing architectural subjects over landscapes, and drawing these with <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s crumbly lines in contrast to the atmospheric effects of the Turneresque vignettes. 
                            Overall, in its graphic and &#x201C;typographic&#x201D; effects, the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copy is much more varied and playful in its response 
                            to print culture than has usually been acknowledged. As both a work and an artifact, the fair copy represents an advance over the earlier manuscript instantiations

                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#MENTORS">Discussion: Mentors</ref>). It was likely owing to the distraction of this opportunity and not merely to his own neglect

                            As physical evidence of this cause for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s ceasing fair&#x2010;copying, the 
                            <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> 
                            abruptly terminates where it runs up against draft for <ref type="apparatus" target="saltzburg_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</ref>, 
                            one of the two poems that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> prepared for publication in

                            This evidence was misinterpreted and misdated by <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName>, who thereby obscured the important causal link 
                            between the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s self&#x2010;apprenticeship 
                            in the print culture of illustratred accounts of travel and topography and his debut as a writer in this genre.</p>
                        <p>While no evidence identifies precisely when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> began the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copy, 
                            the manuscript must postdate <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title>, and <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG2">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</title>, 
                            since the fair copy incorporates his revisions to those manuscripts; and as argued in <ref type="internal" target="#DATEOFCOMPOSITION">Date of Composition</ref>, 
                            he likely commenced fair&#x2010;copying not long before <date when="1834-02">February 1834</date>, when he started the stint of draft in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>. 
                            the sequence of that draft gradually converging with the pace of the fair&#x2010;copying.</p>
                        <p>The interruption in the fair&#x2010;copying in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> accorded with the termination of the draft in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> 
                            because, by that time, the two compositional processes were closely in sync. In <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>, 
                            the text breaks off in mid&#x2010;sentence near the start of the prose essay on <title type="essay" corresp="#JRHEIDELBERGPROSE">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</title>.

                        <p>In the current state of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>, several gaps separate blocks of text, indicating where <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>

                            never made a drawing to fill them, and which are empty because, as he commented in <date when="1885">1885</date> in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>,

                            Drawings could also have been lost (or, for that matter, restored) between <date notBefore="1885" notAfter="1903">1885 and 1903</date>,

                            securely anchored in the <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii_contents.php"><title type="bibliography_text" corresp="JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">List of Proposed Additional Contents for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                            which includes that title. In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, <title type="poem" corresp="#JROHARETHERESPIRITS">&#x201C;Oh are there spirits&#x201D;</title> is treated as belonging to the 
                            <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> project, on the grounds that its positioning in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> 
                            can be persuasively read as announcing a major theme of the following <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> draft&#x2014;<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            spiritual associations with the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> in general and with the <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamonix valley</placeName> in particular, 
                            culminating in the invocation of spiritual beings in the poem, <ref type="witness" target="chamouni_poem_msvii.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRCHAMOUNI">&#x201C;Chamouni&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                            and the essay, <ref type="witness" target="chamouni_prose_msxi.php"><title type="essay" corresp="#JRCHAMOUNIPROSE">&#x201C;Chamouni&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                            Evidence internal to <title type="poem" corresp="#JROHARETHERESPIRITS">&#x201C;Oh are there spirits&#x201D;</title> suggests intertextual connections with the invocation of mountain spirits 
                            by <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName>&#x02BC;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MANFRED">Manfred</persName> (see gloss attached to

                            Finally, as bibliographical evidence for the poem&#x02BC;s relation to the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> included it in his system of 
                            <ref type="internal" target="#LINENUMBERING">Line Numbering</ref> for the project. However, no evidence situates the poem in a specific section of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, 
                            or suggests that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself had a specific destination in mind when he drafted it.</p>
                        <p>It is logical that the draft sequence related to the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> commences following draft

                            The draft dedicated to the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> then remains unusually homogeneous, 
                            by the previous standard of this notebook, the draft becoming mixed with other works only after <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> has composed

                        <p><persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> was certainly incorrect to suggest that &#x201C;the prose and verse description of . . .

                            While the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> sequence does represent the most extensive development of the composite&#x2010;genre version to survive in draft, 
                            <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> neglected to analyze how this manuscript must have been preceded by <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title> 
                            and <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG2">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</title> in the genetic development of the work, even though he was familiar with these other manuscripts. 
                            In <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did not, however, simply pick up where he had left off 
                            in composing verse and prose for the composite&#x2010;genre version, which he had conceptualized in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG2">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</title> 
                            and begun compiling in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copy. By starting the draft with the <title type="essay" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title>, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was casting forward to a projected conclusion of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>&#x2014;a 
                            complement to beginning <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIAG2">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</title> with a prose essay, 
                            <ref type="witness" target="calais_prose_msia_g2.php"><title type="essay" corresp="#JRCALAISPROSE">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</title></ref> about the onset of the tour. 
                            The <title type="essay" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title> essay describes an episode that occurred 
                            at the end of the Ruskins&#x02BC; journey, their excursion to <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</placeName>.</p>
                        <p>In fact, the title, <title type="composite" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title>, may apply not only to the prose essay 
                            but also to the following untitled poem, <ref type="witness" target="i_woke_to_hear_the_lullaby_poem_msviii.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY">&#x201C;I woke to hear the lullaby&#x201D;</title> [&#x201C;The Arve at Chamouni&#x201D;]</ref>, 
                            which, as <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s invented title correctly indicates, describes the <geogName corresp="#ARVE">Arve River</geogName> 
                            flowing through the valley of <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</placeName>. In other words, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> probably intended his title as a section heading. 
                            This increased complexity in composition is significant, not only as additional proof that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> took up 
                            <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> at a stage when he had already conceived of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> 
                            as a composite&#x2010;genre work, but also as an indication of the thematic coherence he imagined for the work, although he never completed the fair copy.</p>
                        <p>The hike to the glacier source of the <geogName corresp="#ARVERON">Arveron River</geogName> was a popular activity for tourists in <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</placeName>. 
                            In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s telling, the excursion suggests a quest for poetic origins: led by local children acting as guides, 
                            the walk to the &#x201C;source&#x201D; reveals a <name type="fictional" corresp="#HIPPOCRENE">Hippocrene</name>&#x2010;like, spiritual place of inspiration. 
                            In this notion of a spiritual poetic source, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drew together multiple ideas, including the trope of crossing mountains 
                            into a sacred bourne, a theme that he had already broached in <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title>, 
                            based on Alpine sections of <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> by 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="rogers_samuel_note.php"><persName corresp="#SR">Samuel Rogers</persName> (<date notBefore="1763" notAfter="1855">1763&#x2013;1855</date>)</ref>. 
                            Moreover, as explained in <ref type="internal" target="#SOURCES">Discussion: Sources and Influences</ref> and <ref type="internal" target="#MENTORS">Mentors</ref>, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s recent correspondence with the writer <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="hogg_james_note.php"><persName corresp="#JH">James Hogg</persName> (ca. 1770&#x2013;1835)</ref>, 
                            who had invited the youth to his farm in the <geogName corresp="#YARROWVALLEY">Yarrow Valley</geogName> of the <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scottish Borders</placeName> 
                            as an act of poetic mentoring, prompted in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> a pastoral &#x201C;reverie&#x201D; about poetry and place. 
                            It is owing to this spiritualization of the journey at the start of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft that a case can be made 
                            for counting <ref type="witness" target="oh_are_there_spirits_can_there_be_poem_msviii.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JROARETHERESPIRITS">&#x201C;Oh are there spirits, can there be&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                            with its suggestions of liminal spaces between nature and the supernatural, as part of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>.</p>
                        <p>The convergence of these themes suggests a date of <date notBefore="1834-02-13" notAfter="1834-02-28">mid&#x2010; to late&#x2010;February 1834</date> 
                            for the start of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft, since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> replied

                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> carried on in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> to develop the trope of mountain crossing

                            may have been the first in the entire sequence of composing the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> to reflect 
                            <persName corresp="#SR">Samuel Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s influence as a poet, as distinct from the influence of the print culture associated with the

                            on the experience of crossing, rather than a prospective one as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> planned, but it is clear that the younger poet modeled his sequence 
                            on <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s approach to the mountains. (In <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, 
                            the approach plays out topographically coming from the west, in the poems <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSTHEGREATSTBERNARD">&#x201C;The Great St. Bernard&#x201D;</title> and 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSTHEDESCENT">&#x201C;The Descent&#x201D;</title>, rather than coming from the north as the Ruskins did.) 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poems lack the pedantic historical references with which <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> 
                            labors his verse; instead, the youth (who was in any case inadequately learned to make such allusions) allowed the verse to unfold by tracing the landscape itself, 
                            coupling the description, if with anything, with a reverential topic, such as the sabbath setting of 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#JRALPSFROMSCHAFFHAUSEN">&#x201C;There is a charmed peace, that aye&#x201D; [&#x201C;The Alps from Schaffhausen&#x201D;]</title>.</p>

                            accords well with a trajectory of this writing toward a terminus ad quem among draft of poetry preparing for his father&#x02BC;s 
                            <date when="1834-05-10">10 May 1834</date> birthday. As the sequence of <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> draft 
                            proceeds from poems about mountain crossings to poems about <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>, the ongoing intermixing of draft relating to points 
                            in northern Europe suggests that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s drafting was gradually converging with his fair&#x2010;copying in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>. 
                            Growing prominent toward the end of the main stint of draft for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> 
                            (<ref type="apparatus" target="msviii_apparatus.php#LISTB1">MS VIII: Contents, section <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, list <hi rend="italic">b</hi>.1</ref>) and

                            are draft pieces related to the break&#x2010;off point of the fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>&#x2014;<title type="composite" corresp="#JRHEIDELBERGCOMP">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</title>,

                        <p>At some points in the text, one may be able to observe <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> pivoting between draft and fair copy. On page 62r of 
                            <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, three&#x2010;quarters of the way down the page, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            started the prose essay, <title type="essay" corresp="#JRBRUSSELSPROSE">&#x201C;Brussels&#x201D;</title>, entitling it 
                            <title type="essay" corresp="#JRBRUSSELSPROSE1_MSVIII">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; [part 1]</title>. This draft extends halfway through 62v, 
                            where it stops in mid&#x2010;sentence, with the word &#x201C;circumnavigating&#x201D; substituted for <del rend="strikethrough">traversing</del>. At this point, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> stopped to compose a poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRJROHSOFTLYBLEW">&#x201C;Oh softly blew the mounting breeze&#x201D; [&#x201C;Chiavenna&#x201D;]</title>; 
                            and then, at the top of the next recto, 63r, he completed the prose essay, <title type="essay" corresp="#JRBRUSSELSPROSE2_MSVIII">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; [part 2]</title>, 
                            which he took up in mid&#x2010;sentence, with the phrase &#x201C;perambulating . . . tread on it softly&#x201D;. In the fair copy of this prose passage, 
                            a line of text ends with the break&#x2010;point in the draft of <title type="essay" corresp="#JRBRUSSELSPROSE1_MSVIII">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; [part 1]</title>, 
                            &#x201C;circumnavigating for&#x201D;&#x2014;with the &#x201C;for&#x201D; jammed against the justified right margin. The next line resumes as in 
                            <title type="essay" corresp="#JRBRUSSELSPROSE2_MSVIII">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; [part 2]</title>: &#x201C;perambulating.&#x2014;Oh woe to the weather&#x201D;. 
                            One might infer, then, that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> fair&#x2010;copied <ref type="witness" target="part_of_brussels_prose1_msviii.php">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; [part 1]</ref> in 
                            <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> as far as he had drafted the prose in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> (62v); 
                            crossed out the last word in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft on 62v (&#x201C;<del rend="strikethrough">traversing</del>&#x201D;), 
                            since he could not fit that word on the line in the fair copy (hence, the tightly fitted, almost run&#x2010;together &#x201C;circumnavigating, for&#x201D;); 
                            then perhaps stopped fair&#x2010;copying the prose in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>, in order to compose the poem that falls next 
                            in draft; and finally resumed drafting prose with <title type="essay" corresp="#JRBRUSSELSPROSE2_MSVIII">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; [part 2]</title>, 
                            only changing his mind about the next word (making it &#x201C;perambulating&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;traversing&#x201D;).</p>
                        <p>Perhaps close to the time when composing and fair&#x2010;copying converged, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> broke off to plan a continuation 
                            of the work (never resumed) in the <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii_contents.php"><title type="bibliography_text" corresp="JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">List of Proposed Additional Contents for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                            which fills the back endpapers of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>. At the start of this list, he took up points along the lower 
                            <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>, which perhaps he had recently drafted, or was in process of drafting. <title type="composite" corresp="#JRANDERNACHTCOMP">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</title> and 
                            <title type="composite" corresp="#JRSTGOARCOMP">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</title>, which head the list, were nothing new, but they are separated by 
                            <title type="composite" corresp="#JREHRENBREITSTEINCOMP">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D;</title>, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            apparently belatedly conceived to act as a bridge between the complementary sections. Then, after deleting <placeName corresp="#FRANKFURT">Frankfurt</placeName>, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> listed <title type="composite" corresp="#JRHEIDELBERGCOMP">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</title>, and 
                            <title type="composite" corresp="#JRSCHAFFHAUSENCOMP">&#x201C;Schaffhausen</title>, both of which emerge comparatively late in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft.</p>
                        <p>Several other places in the list correspond to separate verse and prose pieces drafted in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>&#x2014;pieces 
                            describing the Alpine border between <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>, 
                            and places in <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName>. Also, some illustrations 
                            proposed in the list may correspond to drawings that form the brief gallery of Alpine scenes that were pasted onto otherwise blank pages at the end of the 
                            <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX fair copy</title>. One can only speculate that some draft writing and/or drawings mentioned in this proposed extension 
                            may have been lost, but it seems likely that much of the ambitious plan was never executed beyond what is found in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>. 
                            The project&#x02BC;s state of incompletion is less important, however, than what drew <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s attention away from it. 
                            As both contextual and physical evidence demonstrate, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did not so much abandon the 
                            <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> as put the work on hold, while he segued its achievement 
                            into preparing topographical and ekphrastic verse commissioned for the engraved gift annual, <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title></ref>.</p>
                        <p><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> also contains some rough pen&#x2010;and&#x2010;ink sketches, which do not appear to correspond 
                            to any extant drawings in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX </title>fair copy, but which at least confirm that the graphic element 
                            of the composite&#x2010;genre version was by then well established in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s working procedure.</p>
                        <p>Of the fugitive pieces of writing originally intended for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, and contained in 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msvii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title></ref> and 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msxi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title></ref>, nothing can be inferred in terms of their draft stage, 
                            since the original witnesses are not extant. The texts are unique and fair&#x2010;copied in an unidentified hand 
                            (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="hand_note.php#UNIDENTIFIEDMSSVII_XI">The Ruskin Family Handwriting: Unidentified Hands&#x2014;MS VII, XI Fair Copy of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title></ref>). 
                            That the hand is probably not <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s, and that the fair copies were made without his involvement, can be inferred from some bizarre 
                            instances of diction and punctuation that seem most logically explained as errors in transcription 
                            (see textual glosses for the poems <ref type="witness" target="the_rhine_poem_msvii.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHERHINE">&#x201C;The Rhine&#x201D;</title></ref> and

                            made long after <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drafted the original texts, and after he had abandoned the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> 
                            as a project, since the copies are included in a group of texts&#x2014;all transcribed in the same unidentified hand, which worked from the opposite end of the original use of 
                            <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>&#x2014;which include items originally dating from <date when="1836">1836</date>. The purpose of transcribing these disparate texts 
                            together and at the same time is unknown, but the copyist signified his or her awareness of the texts&#x02BC; respective provenances by adding the dateline &#x201C;1833&#x201D; 
                            at the bottom of two poems originating with the <note type="contextual" target="tour_of_1833_note.php">Tour of 1833</note>&#x2014;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHERHINE">&#x201C;The Rhine&#x201D;</title>

                        <p>Additional information that possibly can be used to draw inferences about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s composition of the 
                            <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> is available in his line numbering, which runs throughout verse portions of the work in 
                            <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title>, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG2">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</title>, 
                            and the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft sequence. (The line numbering is listed, poem by poem, in <ref type="internal" target="APPARATUSTABLE1">Table 1</ref>.) 
                            In none of these manuscripts does the numbering give the appearance of having been added at a time later than composition. Overall, the numbering system appears mechanical, reinforcing the suggestion 
                            of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s regular, uncrowded pace of composition in the manuscripts, despite the sometimes helter&#x2010;skelter 
                            of leaping around the map in the topographical sequence of subjects in draft for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>.</p>
                        <p>Overall, a chronological order of composition is indicated by the sequential line numbering from manuscript to manuscript, despite unexplained gaps 
                            in the numbering, which supports the textual history proposed here for the evolution of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> project. 
                            The numbering advances sequentially from 1&#x2013;173 in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title>, 
                            to 360&#x2013;429 in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG2">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</title>, to 506&#x2013;1484 in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>. 
                            In the two sheets comprising <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title>, the lines of the five poems are numbered 
                            continuously, 1&#x2013;173, without breaks between the separate poems. In <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG2">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</title>, 
                            the line numbering begins following the prose essay, <title type="essay" corresp="#JRCALAISPROSE">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</title>, 
                            starting with the first line of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title> as line 360, 
                            and running continuously from poem to poem, to line 429. Since the poems in this manuscript, unlike those in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title>, 
                            could never have been conceived as sequentially ordered in a topographical sense for fair copy, this instance shows that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            did not employ the system in the course of composition to keep track of a topographical ordering of sections. Nonetheless, the numbering may have been useful to him 
                            when transferring draft to fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>.</p>
                        <p>In the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft sequence, the line numbering takes up with line 506, applied to 
                            <ref type="witness" target="oh_are_there_spirits_can_there_be_poem_msviii.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JROHARETHERESPIRITS">&#x201C;Oh are there spirits, can there be&#x201D;</title></ref>; 
                            and the numbering carries relentlessly and mechanically forward through the verse draft in <ref type="apparatus" target="ms_viii_apparatus.php#CONTENTS">MS VIII: Contents, Section <hi rend="italic">b</hi></ref>, 
                            albeit with occasional gaps or overlapping numbering. 
                            Where poetry encounters prose on the page, the line numbering halts, and then resumes sequentially following the interruption. 
                            As in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG2">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</title>, the line numbering in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> 
                            bears no relation to the topographical sequence, which is jumbled, with poems drafted in no particular geographical order (except for the occasional topographical cluster), 
                            and with some poems such as <title type="poem" corresp="#JRHEIDELBERG">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</title> and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRGENOA">&#x201C;Genoa&#x201D;</title> 
                            divided into parts separated by several pages with no effect on the numbering sequence. Thus, in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> as well, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s numbering the lines of poetry seems mechanical. Doubtless, he needed a line count in order to estimate 
                            the space needed to fair&#x2010;copy lines; however, the system would not have helped him estimate space for prose, and the presence of the numbering in 
                            <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title> suggests that he initiated the numbering scheme before he even conceived 
                            the composite&#x2010;genre version represented by the fair copy.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, the line numbering can be used to corroborate other evidence in drawing conclusions about the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>. 
                            For example, the onset of the numbering in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> with line 506 seems strong evidence for treating the poem 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#JROHARETHERESPIRITS">&#x201C;Oh are there spirits, can there be&#x201D;</title> as a part of the work, especially 
                            since this evidence supports the thematic relevance of the poem. At the opposite end of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> 
                            draft in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, the continuous line numbering ends at line 1484, the final line of the poem 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#JRVILLAPLINIANA">&#x201C;Villa Pliniana&#x201D;</title>; and on the following recto, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            started line numbering anew with line 1 for the start of <ref type="apparatus" target="saltzburg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                            The latter poem, as argued in <ref type="internal" target="PUBLICATION1834">Publication: <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi> (November 1834)</ref>, marks his departure from the 
                            <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> per se, to prepare for publication in <title type="anthology" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>.</p>
                        <p>The line numbering does not, however, supply foolproof evidence that poems comprised within the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> 
                            sequence belong to the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>. In <ref type="apparatus" target="msviii_apparatus.php#LISTB2">MS VIII: Contents, <hi rend="italic">b</hi>.2</ref>, 
                            while <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrapped his line numbering system for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> 
                            around verse clearly meant for another purpose, such as <ref type="apparatus" target="the_address_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRADDRESS">&#x201C;The Address&#x201D;</title></ref> for 
                            <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s birthday, which he left unnumbered, he did carry the numbering through 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="the_crystal_hunter_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRCRYSTALHUNTER">&#x201C;The Crystal Hunter&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                            This poem is simultaneously numbered starting with line 1, using the column on the opposite side of the page from the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> numbering, 
                            suggesting either that the poem bears a tangential relation to the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, 
                            or that the line numbering system served an additional purpose to counting lines for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, 
                            or that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> sometimes numbered the ruled lines on the page ahead of composing and was merely careless 
                            about using those pre&#x2010;numbered lines for other kinds of poetry.</p>
                        <p>Irregularities occur within the numbering, some of which are probably mere mistakes. It is possible, however, that some irregularities can be used 
                            as evidence in unraveling a more complex compositional history than what usually appears to have been a straightforwardly linear production of text. 
                            These cases are discussed in the textual glosses appended to individual texts

                            must have intended the table as a plan for the work&#x02BC;s continuation, and not as an overview from start to finish. As such, we can conceive of him compiling 
                            this list either at the point when he began drafting (and perhaps simultaneously fair&#x2010;copying) those three sections, the last to be completed

                            since the fair copy proceeds from <title type="composite" corresp="#JRSTGOARCOMP">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</title> to <title type="composite" corresp="#JRHEIDELBERGCOMP">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</title>,

                            next to these five items in the list doubtless bear some significance; and while we cannot ascertain who was responsible for these marks or precisely what they signified, 
                            we can conjecture that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> made the marks with the intention to highlight the boundaries of a section,

                            While this meager authority might justify collecting these five poems as a conjectural corpus, we would be left with the problem that the fair copy 
                            supplies no precedent for an all&#x2010;verse section (although it does include an all&#x2010;prose section, <title type="composite" corresp="#JRAIXLACHAPELLECOMP">&#x201C;Aix la Chapelle&#x201D;</title>); 
                            and we would need to imagine <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> composing some prose for the section, not to mention illustrating it with &#x201C;engravings,&#x201D; had he carried on with the project.</p>

                            It seems surprising that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would have failed to add a couplet or two celebrating his submissions to another editor,

                            preceded the composition of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title>, for, although it may seem logical 
                            that revision of existing text would have predated invention of new, one can imagine as an equally likely scenario that <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>

                            close together is suggested, moreover, by the probable timing of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s fair&#x2010;copying of the

                            Since the fair&#x2010;copy texts of the poems for these sections remain largely unchanged from their first instantiation in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG2">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</title>,

                            which showed that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> &#x201C;had intended this volume [the fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>] 
                            to contain about 150 pieces of prose and poetry, and at least as many drawings!&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>,

                            In nonetheless excluding prose, without comment, from his reconstruction of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, 
                            <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> was influenced not only by the unexamined biographical myths that resulted in the market conditions favoring his edition; 
                            he also passed along <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own habit in later life of referring to the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> 
                            as his &#x201C;rhymed history of the tour&#x201D;. In <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>&#x02BC;s

                        <p>Whether <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> planned to include the prose sections of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> 
                            in the volume of prose that he projected as a companion to <title type="book" corresp="JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> is unknown. 
                            Perhaps he would have excerpted selections in an introduction, following his manner of confining the earliest juvenile verse to the &#x201C;Editor&#x02BC;s Introduction&#x201D; 
                            in the edition of the poems. For one suspects that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> would have attached little importance to these prose pieces, 
                            in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> imitates the style of letterpress writers for the illustrated travel literature of his youth, 
                            sometimes adopting the wryly ironic, tendentious tone favored by the livelier of these writers, other times mocking the false pedantry of jobbing writers 
                            who worked up their subject with no experience of the places they described. While <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> did not suppress writing 
                            that opened up the youth&#x02BC;s sense of fun, he felt obliged to present <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;juvenile productions&#x201D; 
                            as consistent with the mature author&#x02BC;s mission to elevate &#x201C;the public taste in poetry as well as art&#x201D;; and it was in &#x201C;these poems&#x201D;, 
                            according to the editor, that, &#x201C;although [<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>] thrust them aside for prose&#x201D;, the youth 
                            &#x201C;could better put the complicated feelings, thoughts, and facts which he had to tell&#x201D;. The poems, therefore, constituted 
                            &#x201C;the best introduction to his later and greater books&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>, 1:xx&#x2013;xxi; and

                        <p>Another misrepresentation lay in <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s omission of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s illustrations 
                            to the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>; and while this omission might be ascribed to limits on the cost of reproduction&#x2014;the 
                            plates that reproduce <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s drawings were confined to enhancing the deluxe collector&#x02BC;s edition of <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title>, 
                            while only a few figures that facsimiled his fair&#x2010;copy printing were retained for the common edition&#x2014;<persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> passed over 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s illustrations drawn specifically for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> 
                            in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>. His purpose, according to the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPREFATORYNOTESPLATES">&#x201C;Prefatory Notes on the Plates&#x201D;</title> 
                            (printed in the deluxe edition only), was &#x201C;to show <persName corresp="#JR">Mr. Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand at different periods, in different materials, 
                            and in different styles&#x201D;&#x2014;an ambition that had recently come within reach with the perfection of photogravure in the <date notBefore="1880" notAfter="1889">1880s</date>, 
                            which could &#x201C;render the very marks of the pencil and strokes of the pen&#x201D;. Thus, to accompany the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, 
                            <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> selected <title type="artwork" corresp="#JRWATCHTOWERATANDERNACH">&#x201C;Watch&#x2010;tower at Andernach&#x201D;</title> (<date when="1833">1833</date>) 
                            &#x201C;as an example of the careful, though untaught, work of a boy of fourteen&#x201D;; the plate reproduces &#x201C;in actual size part of a larger drawing 
                            in pen on warm grey paper done in the manner which the young artist evolved for himself out of copying <persName corresp="#GC">Cruikshank</persName>&#x201D;. 
                            As a second accompaniment, <title type="artwork" corresp="#JRJUNGFRAUFROMINTERLAKEN">&#x201C;The Jungfrau from Interlachen&#x201D;</title> (<date when="1833">1833</date>) 
                            represented &#x201C;one of [<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s] attempts to imitate the <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> vignettes&#x201D;, 
                            an attempt deemed &#x201D;artificially composed&#x2014;not without skill, though with less regard than he afterwards paid to truth of mountain&#x2010;drawing&#x201D;. 
                            Besides contributing to the larger goal of documenting <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s developing drawing style, however, 
                            these plates reveal another intention, less prominently stated but significant for <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s approach to editing 
                            the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>. The editor says that, to illustrate &#x201C;the &#x2018;Tours&#x2019; 
                            of <date when="1833">1833</date> and <date when="1835">1835</date>&#x201D;, he chose &#x201C;drawings made at the time and for the purpose&#x201D;, 
                            but it is evident that the &#x201C;purpose&#x201D; meant, for <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>, attentiveness to scenic experiences of touring, 
                            and not <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s interest in the technology of printed images. That is, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> 
                            was engaged by the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> less as a work in itself than as biographical record of family travel

                            (The latter choice of vignette is representative of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> only indirectly, in that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>

                        <p>For copytext of the poems making up his version, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s first choice was to use texts as published

                            applies to three poems: <title type="poem" corresp="#JRANDERNACHT">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</title> and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSTGOAR">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</title>,

                            <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>; and in cases where only draft survives, he drew the texts from <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG2">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</title>, and

                            regularized punctuation and spelling, and he did not scruple to mend lines as he saw fit. (Details are given in the textual glosses attached to transcriptions.)

                        <p>Despite this pattern of giving authority to the latest revised and published or fair&#x2010;copied texts, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> 
                            acted inconsistently in bestowing authority on an &#x201C;original&#x201D;, as he called it, if it took his fancy. In the case of the poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</title>, 
                            <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> took main copytext from <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title>,

                        <p>Regarding the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> in particular, it seems especially unlikely that

                            given the author&#x02BC;s disparaging remarks about the project in chapter 4 (<date when="1885">1885</date>) of <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>.

                            In <date when="1882">1882</date>, before he even started writing the autobiography, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s stake 
                            in editing the poems had been prompted by the American publisher, <orgName corresp="#JWILEY">John Wiley &#x0026; Sons</orgName>, stealing a march on reprinting 
                            the poems first published in the annuals, causing him to raise the alarm to <persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName> (7 February 1882 or 1883,

                            It is interesting to speculate how that perceived theft might have helped to sponsor the idea of writing an autobiography, but once he had told his story in that book 
                            and in his own way about his creation of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> and his subsequent publication

                            &#x201C;I well remember going with my father into the shop where subscribers entered their names, 
                            and being referred to the specimen print, the turreted window over <placeName corresp="#MOSELLE">Moselle</placeName>, 
                            at <placeName corresp="#COBLENZ">Coblentz</placeName>. We got the book home to <placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName> before the time
                            of our usual annual tour&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 39:79; and see

                            This work, which was indeed published that spring with <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> among the printed list of subscribers, 
                            is credited by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, doubtless apocryphally, with having prompted the family&#x02BC;s tour spontaneously, 
                            whereas the journey must in fact have long been in planning: 
                            &#x201C;as my mother watched my father&#x02BC;s pleasure and mine in looking at the wonderful places, she said, why should we not go and see some of them in reality? 
                            My father hesitated a little, then with glittering eyes said&#x2014;why not? And there were two or three weeks of entirely rapturous and amazed preparation&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 39:79). While <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            lithographs cannot solely have prompted the tour as such, the book probably did help imaginatively to orient the family to the north of Europe, 
                            just as <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> 
                            provided a vision of the southern region of the Continent.</p>
                        <p>The influence of these two publications is exaggerated in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, 
                            but the two books can be viewed as representative not only of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s conceptualization of his family&#x02BC;s 
                            northern and southern destinations, but also of how those destinations were materially embodied in the illustrated travel writing and publication of 
                            the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>. <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="artwork" corresp="#PROUTSKETCHES"><hi rend="italic">Facsimiles</hi></title> 
                            provides a pictorial tour through <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName> in fifty lithographic prints, 
                            featuring picturesque medieval and Renaissance architectural sites. The book contains no letterpress; the locales depicted are identified only by place names 
                            lettered directly onto the lithographic stone, as part of the image. The lithographs, then a new medium in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>, 
                            would have struck the Ruskins by their dramatically large size (22 by 15 inches) and watercolor&#x2010;like texture. In contrast, 
                            <persName corresp="#SP">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> leads the reader on the more traditional 
                            Grand Tour through the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> into the south. The linked series of topographical and narrative poems forms a more conventional work, 
                            less picturesque than historical and classically learned. <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s verse and taste were late&#x2010;eighteenth&#x2010;century in manner, 
                            and his <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> could not compete in popularity with 
                            <persName corresp="#GGB">Lord Byron</persName>&#x02BC;s fourth part of <title type="poem" corresp="#BYRONPILGRIMAGE"><hi rend="italic">Childe Harold&#x02BC;s Pilgrimage</hi></title>, 
                            which is set in <placeName corresp="#VENICE">Venice</placeName>. While not entirely ignored, the work gained popular acclaim only when 
                            <persName corresp="#SP">Rogers</persName> invested in the graphic enhancements that enabled him to repackage the poem as the <date when="1830">1830</date> illustrated edition, 
                            exploiting the up&#x2010;to&#x2010;date technologies of steel engraving and mass production that had sponsored the boom in 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</ref> 
                            (see <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="samuel_rogers_note.php">Samuel Rogers [1763&#x2013;1855]</ref>).
                            The edition was innovative also in combining an intaglio process&#x2014;its finely etched, steel&#x2010;engraved vignettes (2&#x2013;3 inches by 3&#x2013;4 inches) that illustrate 
                            <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s poems&#x2014;with the relief printing of the poems on the same page. The exquisite vignettes 
                            (a more typical size for the engraved area of steel&#x2010;engraved book illustration was larger, 7 by 5 inches [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED">Hunnisett, <hi rend="italic">Steel&#x2010;Engraved Book Illustration in England</hi></ref>, 35]) 
                            conveyed <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s atmospheric effects on a scale that harmonized with <persName corresp="#SP">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            modest poems; and the genre vignettes by <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>&#x2014;long a favorite artist of Rogers&#x02BC;s&#x2014;presented 
                            a benignly colorful of peasant culture. For the Ruskins, both the contrasts and complements with <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s imposing lithographic plates detailing busy town squares 
                            surrounding picturesque architectural monuments must have seemed dramatic.</p>
                        <p>As the compositional history is interpreted in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <title corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> 
                            underwent a development parallel to that of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s work, originating as a travelogue written solely in verse 
                            and in an eighteenth&#x2010;century manner of topographical poetry, and then being elaborated as an illustrated composite&#x2010;genre travel narrative 
                            typical of the steel&#x2010;engraved landscape <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">annuals</ref> 
                            of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date> (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>). The Ruskin family 
                            was familiar with <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> in one of its earlier, non&#x2010;illustrated versions, which they owned, 
                            as well as with the <date when="1830">1830</date> illustrated version (although, as remarked in <ref type="internal" target="#DATEOFCOMPOSITION">Date of Composition</ref>, there is some ambiguity concerning when the family 
                            acquired the illustrated version). Regardless of when this book entered the household, its influence is palpable from the start of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copy of the <title corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>.

                            as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s model, at the cost of recognizing his imitations of <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#PROUTSKETCHES"><hi rend="italic">Facsimiles</hi></title> 
                            (see, e.g., <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SPEARRUSKINSITALY">Spear, &#x201C;Ruskin&#x02BC;s Italy&#x201D;</ref>), it is true that 
                            <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s book frames the foundational layout and conception of the composite&#x2010;genre <title corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>.

                            for these section titles, he uses a lettering that imitates <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s restrained display type. 
                            (The <title type="composite" corresp="#JRSTGOARCOMP">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</title> and <title type="composite" corresp="#JRHEIDELBERGCOMP">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</title>

                            vis&#x2010;&#x00E0;&#x2010;vis text likewise imitates <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s layout, by heading the first page of each section 
                            with a landscape vignette above the section title, in order to situate the reader in a distinct place, and by closing each section with a figure vignette as a tailpiece, 
                            in order to caption some portion of the narrative.</p>
                        <p>In this arrangement of text and image, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> captured the <date when="1830">1830</date> <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY1830"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>&#x02BC;s 
                            notable innovation of combining the intaglio effects of the vignette on the same page with the relief type. <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> 
                            probably based his layout on the admired designs by <persName corresp="#WBPUBLISHER">William Bulmer</persName> (<date notBefore="1757" notAfter="1830">1757&#x2013;1830</date>) 
                            for editions of English poets, published in the <date notBefore="1790" notAfter="1799">1790s</date> by his <orgName corresp="SHAKSPEAREPRESS">Shakspeare Press</orgName><!-- DCH: do not alter spelling; this spelling is correct for Bulmer's press -->

                            The editions were decorated with wood&#x2010;engraved vignettes by <persName corresp="TBENGRAVER">Thomas Bewick</persName> (<date notBefore="1753" notAfter="1828">1753&#x2013;1828</date>), 
                            set at the heads of title pages of the poems, and producing an elegant page layout, which was made possible by the conformity of the relief wood engraving with the relief type. 
                            That conformity was not possible in the new mass&#x2010;produced <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">annuals</ref>, 
                            which relied on the durability of steel engraving to achieve unprecedented print runs for illustrated books. To solve this problem, and achieve the elegant effects 
                            of <persName corresp="#WBPUBLISHER">Bulmer</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="TBENGRAVER">Bewick</persName>&#x02BC;s designs, and yet print the books on a massive scale, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s printers innovated a technique, 
                            which was widely remarked in reviews of the <date when="1830">1830</date> <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY1830"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, 
                            whereby precise registration allowed the sheets to be run through the press twice, once for the engraving, and once for the type

                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was attentive to this up&#x2010;to&#x2010;date innovation.</p>

                            exploited the potential of fine&#x2010;lined but durable steel engraving to allow indefinite borders of an engraving to melt into the white space of the paper, 
                            creating a world within the page (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PIGGOTTTURNERSVIGNETTES">Piggott, <title type="book" corresp="#PIGGOTTTURNERSVIGNETTES"><hi rend="italic">Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes</hi></title></ref>, 14&#x2013;16). 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s drawings emphasize how such frameless, soft&#x2010;edged rectangular, square, or oval designs harmonize

                                but an exploration of the anecdotal, touristic world of the traveler&#x02BC;s picturesque, and how this world is captured by the fluid and watercolor&#x2010;like texture of a lithograph, 
                                as compared with the fairy world of brilliant light and haunted shadow suggested by the exquisite intaglio of <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s vignettes. 
                                To indicate the relative size of <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s lithograph, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drew the image full&#x2010;page and 
                                broadside in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX notebook</title>. Another copy after <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName> is contained within the section on

                            But <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> subtitled his work <hi rend="italic">A Poem</hi>, and he dispersed the few prose pieces irregularly, 
                            with at most a pattern of loose association with their immediately surrounding poems, whereas <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> constructed 
                            each of his topographical sections (with one exception) using both verse and prose. Unlike <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did not independently title his prose pieces, but subordinated them to the topographical unit, 
                            typically separating prose from poem with a drawing, which serves as a hinge between the two kinds of writing and binds the parts into an associative, 
                            but still coherent unit. At the same time, while complementing the poems, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s prose pieces also contrast 
                            with his rather generalized, picturesque poetic views, by bringing the tone down to earth with first&#x2010;person, anecdotal and comedic commentary 
                            about specific locales.</p>
                        <p>Thus, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> amplified <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s uniform pattern of text and illustration, which 
                            in the <date when="1830">1830</date> <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> consists of a landscape vignette after a drawing by <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName> 
                            serving as a header, placed above a poem&#x02BC;s title; and following the poem, a figure vignette after a drawing by <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>, 
                            serving as a tailpiece. (The prose pieces are not illustrated.) While in its present condition, the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copy 
                            is missing many drawings (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPOSITEILLUSTRATEDTRAVELOGUE">The Composite&#x2010;Genre Illustrated Travelogue</ref>), 
                            the examples remaining in place indicate that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intended, at the least, to complement each poem with a prose piece, 
                            and to supply each poem and each prose piece with its own headpiece and tailpiece&#x2014;four vignettes in total for each topographical unit. 
                            And while <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> typically honors <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s pattern of using a landscape or cityscape as a headpiece, 
                            and a figure drawing as tailpiece, he varies the pattern somewhat (as does <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>) by occasionally heading a section 
                            with a more anecdotal, narrative vignette.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> carries his principle of amplification in the sister arts to an extreme in the sections on 
                            <title type="composite" corresp="#JRANDERNACHTCOMP">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</title>, <title type="composite" corresp="#JREHRENBREITSTEINCOMP">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D;</title>, 
                            and <title type="composite" corresp="#JRSTGOARCOMP">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</title>. With each section fully elaborated in itself as a composite of verse, prose, 
                            and illustration, the outer sections of the trio also work as contrasts to one another&#x2014;the first, <title type="composite" corresp="#JRANDERNACHTCOMP">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</title>, 
                            composed and illustrated in a gothic mode; and the third, <title type="composite" corresp="#JRSTGOARCOMP">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</title>, in a domestic mode. 
                            Between them, <title type="composite" corresp="#JREHRENBREITSTEINCOMP">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D;</title> both functions as and thematizes the topic of confluence, 
                            as the meeting point of dark gothic and sunny domesticity. Confluence is topographically represented by the meeting point 
                            of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine River</geogName> and the <geogName corresp="#MOSELLE">Moselle River</geogName> at <placeName corresp="#COBLENZ">Coblenz</placeName>, 
                            where the fortress of <placeName type="building" corresp="#EHRENBREITSTEINFORT">Ehrenbreitstein</placeName> looms over the rivers&#x02BC; juncture. 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s landscape vignette for <title type="composite" corresp="#JREHRENBREITSTEINCOMP">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D;</title> 
                            is copied after one of <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s renderings of the fortress, not from <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, 
                            but from a full&#x2010;page steel engraving in an annual&#x2014;<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> having appointed himself the exercise of reducing the bold scene 
                            to a small oval.</p>
                            <p>Evidence in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft suggests that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> began a similar amplification in describing 
                                the first sighting of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> from <placeName corresp="#SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</placeName>. Two attempts at drafting poems 
                                about this experience suggest the contrasting registers of the sublime and domestic, like <title type="poem" corresp="#JRANDERNACHT">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</title> 
                                and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSTGOAR">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</title>. The earlier composed of the two poems, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRALPSFROMSCHAFFHAUSEN">&#x201C;There is a charmed peace, that aye&#x201D; [&#x201C;The Alps from Schaffhausen&#x201D;]</title>, 
                                builds up to its cry of discovery, &#x201C;The <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>,&#x2014;Full far away / The long successive ranges lay&#x201D;, 
                                by imaginatively coursing the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>, whereas a later&#x2010;composed fragment, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">&#x201C;Schaffhausen&#x201D;</title>, 
                                can be read as an alternate introduction to the scene, by tracing a stroll to the &#x201C;summit of the hill&#x201D; from whence presumably 
                                the mountains would be sighted, had <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> continued with the poem. Biographically, the climb up that hill occurred on the same Sabbath evening 
                                with which <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> opens his description of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> in <title type="poem" corresp="#JRALPSFROMSSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">>&#x201C;There is a charmed peace that aye>&#x201D; [>&#x201C;The Alps from Schaffhausen>&#x201D;]</title>, 
                                but the fragment, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">&#x201C;Schaffhausen&#x201D;</title>, seems the start of a domestic complement 
                                to the sublimity of the earlier&#x2010;composed, longer piece, with its description of the river driving toward the <geogName corresp="RHINEFALLS">Rhine Falls</geogName>, 
                                rendered in emphatically pounded dactylic lines, which stand out from the normal, amiable flow of iambic octosyllabic verse.</p>
                        <p>As a contrast with these large, amplified units of verse, prose, and picture, comprising contrasting genres, the section <title type="composite" corresp="#JRAIXLACHAPELLECOMP">&#x201C;Aix la Chapelle&#x201D;</title> 
                            in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> consists only of a prose text and a single illustration. The headpiece is an imposing rendering of the city&#x02BC;s cathedral, 
                            drawn in <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s manner. Taking up nearly a full page like <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s other ambitious copy after <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>, 
                            the lithograph&#x2010;like drawing of <title type="artwork" corresp="#JRTHEMEUSELIEGEMSIX">Li&#x00E8;ge</title>, the large rectangular image of the cathedral is not a vignette, 
                            and was probably meant to imitate the comparatively large dimensions of <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s portfolio. Beneath the drawing, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            allowed just enough space for the section heading and a few lines of text, just as place names are lettered directly onto <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s plates. 
                            Even here, however, where <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> pivots away from his grand multi&#x2010;genre and multi&#x2010;media amplifications of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s design, 
                            to exhibit a large&#x2010;scale but unitary plate in the manner of <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>, he cannot resist varying the single prose essay by combining in it 
                            both comic and picturesque modes (the latter typically represented by verse in the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>). 
                            First, the narrator riffs on the <date when="1748-04-24">Peace of Aix la Chapelle</date> to mock the somnolent &#x201C;peace treaties&#x201D; governing the local postillions, 
                            but then the speaker is rhapsodically taken by the sublimity of the cathedral&#x02BC;s interior in moonlight, described in the manner of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>. 
                            Finally, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s narrator parodies a guidebook writer&#x02BC;s tour of antiquities inside the cathedral. As in the section, 
                            <title type="composite" corresp="#JREHRENBREITSTEINCOMP">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D;</title>, the condensation of multiple genres is thematically reflected in a geographical 
                            situation that bespeaks confluence. <placeName corresp="#AIXLACHAPELLE">Aix la Chapelle</placeName> lay at the juncture of the <placeName corresp="#NETHERLANDS">Netherlands</placeName>, 
                            <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName>, and the newly founded <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName>, and the city was historically distinctive for its imperial status.</p>
                       <p>In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s liveliness of response to the material world of art production and reproduction that guided early Victorian picturesque travel, his achievement 
                            in the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> is overlooked by interpretations that insist on the neurotic constraints of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early self&#x2010;instruction 
                            in drawing. For example, <persName corresp="#PHW">Paul H. Walton</persName> sees <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s adoption of <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            &#x201C;outline style&#x201D; of depicting old architecture with &#x201C;broken lines and dots&#x201D; 
                            as one example of the youth&#x02BC;s tendency &#x201C;to revert to pen and ink in more factual studies of picturesque buildings and views&#x201D;, 
                            owing to a misguided direction of &#x201C;his earliest art activity . . . along lines strictly defined by adult standards and ideas of what 
                            was educationally desirable, so that he was not encouraged, nor did he have the time, to draw in a playful way the kinds of figure subjects in which a child 
                            imaginatively expresses and defines a conception of himself within a framework of human relationships&#x201D;. As a contrast with this alleged &#x201C;crippl[ing]&#x201D; of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            imagination, which &#x201C;had much to do with the tragedy of his personal life&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#PHW">Walton</persName> points to &#x201C;the happy, normal family life of a boy&#x201D; 
                            like <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s later sexual nemesis, <persName corresp="#JEM">John Everett Millais</persName>, whose youthful drawings included the kind of &#x201C;subjects usually preferred by boy artists: 
                            soldiers, animals, machines, caricatures of family and friends&#x201D;. As a consequence, even when a prospect of freedom opened up in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s youthful art teaching, 
                            such as when his first drawing master, <ref type="note" target="runciman_charles_note.php">Charles Runciman (1798&#x2013;1864)</ref> challenged the boy &#x201C;to imitate the free, 
                            controlled sweep of the pencil in . . . [the teacher&#x02BC;s] models&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, according to <persName corresp="#PHW">Walton</persName>, retreated to his more formal depictions of buildings in pen and ink 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WALTONDRAWINGS">Walton, <hi rend="italic">Drawings of John Ruskin</hi></ref>, 13, 7, 8, 7, 6).</p>
                        <p>It is not true, however, that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s writing and drawings neglect subjects appropriate to &#x201C;boy artists&#x201D;; 
                            more importantly, <persName corresp="#PHW">Walton</persName>&#x02BC;s division of the normative from the creative ignores how spontaneity and invention can be prompted 
                            in surprising ways, and one of these is the young <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s playfulness in manipulating the material culture surrounding a youth of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>. 
                            In the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> not only contrasts 
                            what he finds in print culture, such as the respective scales of <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName> lithographs and <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName> vignettes; 
                            he also amuses himself by manipulating that culture&#x2014;for example, reconceptualizing <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s full&#x2010;page engraving, 
                            <title type="artwork" corresp="#JMWTEHRENBREITSTEINIMAGE"><hi rend="italic">Ehrenbreitstein</hi></title>, as a vignette, or shrinking one of <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            market square scenes to a Lilliputian vignette heading <title type="composite" corresp="#JRLILLECOMP">&#x201C;Lille&#x201D;</title>, a section that in itself plays

                                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s later story about his supposed contretemps, when he was introduced as a boy wonder to the famous man of taste, of

                                    thus implying that the youth knew &#x201C;more of the vignettes [in <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY1830"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>]

                                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did respond insightfully and creatively to the poems, however, as becomes evident by comparing his draft writing for the Italian and

                                    by &#x201C;look[ing] once on the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> . . . / And think[ing] on the moment thenceforward for ever&#x201D;&#x2014;the speaker 
                                    goes on to meditate on the <geogName corresp="ALPS">Alps</geogName> as a &#x201C;barrier&#x201D; determining the fate of nations rather than the self, whether of nations struggling to conquer that barrier or seeking its protection. 
                                    For the English during the Napoleonic era and afterward, this theme was resonant with recent threats of invasion. But writing in <date when="1818">1818</date> (and looking back to his tour taken 
                                    during the temporary peace of <date when="1814">1814</date>), <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> is able to contrast the danger and difficulty of nations struggling in the past against the barrier of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>, 
                                    using historical examples such as <persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName>&#x02BC;s invasion of <placeName corresp="ROMEANCIENT">Rome</placeName>, with the pleasure of the modern tourist&#x02BC;s ease and security of mountain travel. 
                                    That ease was afforded, ironically, by wartime engineering to overcome the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alpine</geogName> barrier, bringing conquest. (<persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> entered <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> 
                                    from western <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName>, using the broad carriage road through the <geogName corresp="#SIMPLON">Simplon Pass</geogName>, 
                                    which had been laid by <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>&#x02BC;s engineers.) In <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title>, 
                                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> elaborates <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s brief historical example of <persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName>&#x02BC;s crossing into a poem&#x2010;length spectacle, 
                                    his imagination likely fired not only by <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s lines but also by <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s vignette for that poem in the 
                                    <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY1830">1830 edition of <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, which depicts <persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName>&#x02BC;s army 
                                    filing with their elephants through the mountains. In his poem, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> makes a corresponding effort at writing the sublime, 
                                    adumbrating the catastrophe for <placeName corresp="#ROMEANCIENT">Rome</placeName> in the menacing turmoil of the surrounding landscape and atmosphere. The poem is to some degree an ekphrasis, 
                                    based on <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s vignette 
                                    (see the contextual glosses for <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title>).</p>
                                <p>In context of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan</title>, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title> 
                                    can be viewed structurally either as a pivot between the two clusters&#x2014;that on the first distant sighting of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>, 
                                    and the cluster on crossing the mountains into <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>&#x2014;or the poem can be regarded as the first piece 
                                    in the series relating the physical crossing. It should be borne in mind that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> composed the poem earlier than and separately from the other poems 
                                    about mountain crossing. In its original context, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG2">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</title>, 
                                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title> was situated between the prose essay,

                                    (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPOSITETRAVELOGUE">The Composite&#x2010;Genre Travelogue [MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2]</ref>). 
                                    Here, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was perhaps imitating <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s structural function of <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</title> as a pivotal poem, 
                                    preparing the reader for passing through the &#x201C;barrier&#x201D; of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> between north and south, <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName>, by reflecting on history and spectacle&#x2014;<persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName>&#x02BC;s crossing&#x2014;just 
                                    as <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> causes the reader to trace and re&#x2013;trace ground between west and east, by reflecting on both ancient and modern history.</p>
                                <p>By selecting only the one historical example of <persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName>&#x02BC;s crossing for elaboration, however, from the several with which <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> crowds <title type="poem" corresp="ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</title>, 
                                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> demonstrates a tendency to expand and attenuate what <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> presents as layers of memory and history. 
                                    On the one hand, by positioning his <persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName> poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title>, 
                                    as a fulcrum between sections about approaching the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> and sections about crossing the mountains, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> acknowledges <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s procedure of concentrating and multiplying perspectives. 
                                    In <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</title>, the speaker describes multiple viewpoints, 
                                    first recalling his approach to the mountains from below, in western <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName> (<persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> begins <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> in <placeName corresp="#LAKEGENEVA">Lake Geneva</placeName> and environs) 
                                    and then gazing over a wide prospect from above&#x2014;retracing the winding road that he has climbed, and anticipating the path that he will follow to descend 
                                    into <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>. In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s sequence, these stages are drawn out as a succession of real&#x2010;time descriptions, 
                                    with each stage of the passage represented by a separate poem: the sublime terror of the <geogName corresp="#VIAMALA">Via Mala</geogName>; a respite in the pastoral village of <placeName corresp="#SPLUGENVILLAGE">Spl&#x00FC;gen</placeName>; 
                                    the turning point achieved amid the bleak landscape of the summit, with its dire remembrances of fallen travelers; and the breathtaking descent, winding among the precipitous cliffs, viewed first from above and then from below.
                                    In <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> places <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</title>, 
                                    which describes (without naming) the <geogName corresp="#SIMPLON">Simplon</geogName>, following the poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSTHEGREATSTBERNARD">&#x201C;The Great St. Bernard&#x201D;</title> 
                                    (which he did not visit); and between these two poems falls another, <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSTHEDESCENT">&#x201C;The Descent&#x201D;</title>, 
                                    which illogically leads the traveler downward from the <geogName corresp="#SIMPLON">Simplon</geogName> (again without explicitly identifying it) before the traveler arrives at the pass in <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</title>. 
                                    But <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> was less concerned than <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> with tracing the journey linearly; 
                                    rather, he framed multiple and overlapping opportunites to contextualize the journey in both ancient and recent history. Anticipating the catalog of historical struggles 
                                    against the Alpine barrier in <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</title>, the speaker in <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSTHEDESCENT">&#x201C;The Descent&#x201D;</title> 
                                    relays his guide&#x02BC;s tale of personally encountering <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName> himself, marching his army to <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> and victory at <placeName corresp="#MARENGO">Marengo</placeName>.</p>
                                <p>Yet, while <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> makes his sequences linear where <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s are complex, he does learn from <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s ability to discipline his proclivity 
                                    for digression and complexity by imposing neoclassical balance. In <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, 
                                    <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> digresses between <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSTHEDESCENT">&#x201C;The Descent&#x201D;</title> and <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</title> 
                                    to relate two verse narratives, but the stories are balanced topographically and thematically. <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSJORASSE">&#x201C;Jorasse&#x201D;</title>, a highland tale about an intrepid <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alpine</geogName> hunter who delves into a cave, 
                                    is complemented by <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSMARGUERITEDETOURS">&#x201C;Marguerite de Tours&#x201D;</title>, a lowland tale about a girl who crosses from <placeName corresp="MARTIGNY">Martigny</placeName>, 
                                    on the Swiss side of the <geogName corresp="#STBERNARD">St. Bernard</geogName>, to the opposite <placeName corresp="#VALDAOSTA">vale of Aosta</placeName> 
                                    in order to attend to her dying father. Symmetrical and complementary arrangement when showcasing variety was characteristic of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s mix of Neoclassicism and Romanticism, 
                                    a principle reflected in the arrangement not only of his verse but also of his art collection in his famed <placeName corresp="#STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</placeName> bachelor&#x02BC;s residence. 
                                    As one of visitors, the art historian <persName corresp="#GFW">Gustav Friedrich Waagen</persName>, commented in <date when="1835">1835</date>, 
                                    &#x201C;one knows not whether more to admire the diversity or the purity of his taste&#x201D; in exhibiting his treasures; &#x201C;[p]ictures of the most different schools, 
                                    ancient and modern sculptures, Greek vases, alternately attract the eye, and are so arranged, with a judicious regard to their size, in proportion to the place assigned them, 
                                    that every room is richly and picturesquely ornamented, without having the appearance of a magazine, from being over&#x2013;filled, as we often find&#x201D;

                                    Just so, in both the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> and the first publication derived from it, 
                                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRFRAGMENTS">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> observes <persName corresp="#JR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                                    complementary balancing of variety by pairing, for example, the contrasting modes of gothic sublimity in 
                                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRANDERNACHT">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</title> with domestic beauty in <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSTGOAR">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</title>; 
                                    and in the original version, he completed the design by bridging the two poems with a middle section, <title type="composite" corresp="#JREHRENBREITSTEINCOMP">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D;</title>, 
                                    which develops a trope of confluence (in the joining of two rivers, the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> and the <geogName corresp="#MOSELLE">Moselle</geogName>). 
                                    In another example of arranging variety around a midpoint, he planned for <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESUMMIT">&#x201C;The Summit&#x201D;</title> to serve as 
                                    the centerpiece of the cluster about crossing the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>. At the same time, in <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESUMMIT">&#x201C;The Summit&#x201D;</title> 
                                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> tries out <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s own way of allowing for variety within a symmetrical frame, 
                                    by digressing into a narrative. If <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> balances his two narrative poems, <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSJORASSE">&#x201C;Jorasse&#x201D;</title> 
                                    and <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSMARGUERITEDETOURS">&#x201C;Marguerite de Tours&#x201D;</title>, as a complementary pair, highland tale and lowland tale, 
                                    he also digresses and elaborates: both <name type="fictional" corresp="#MARGUERITEDETOURS">Marguerite</name> and <name type="fictional" corresp="#JORASSE">Jorasse</name> 
                                    cross mountains to maintain fidelity. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> is prompted by the wayside crosses on the summit of <placeName corresp="#SPLUGEN">Spl&#x00FC;gen Pass</placeName> 
                                    to compare Alpine with <geogName corresp="#LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</geogName> tales of fidelity in tragedy. He narrates the story of <persName corresp="#CG">Charles Gough</persName>, 
                                    who fell to his death while climbing <geogName corresp="#HELVELLYN">Mount Helvellyn</geogName>, and whose corpse was loyally guarded by his <name type="animal" corresp="#FOXEY">dog</name> until discovered. 
                                    While <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> adopted the story from <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#WW">Wordsworth</persName>&#x02BC;s poems 
                                    about <persName corresp="#CG">Gough</persName>&#x02BC;s fate (see the contextual glosses to this poem), 
                                    it was the influence of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> that prompted him to digress into such a story at the midpoint of the poems about mountain crossing.
                                    For another instance of this technique of using topographical description to frame a narrative digression&#x2014;a tale that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> again

                            <p>As an engagement with print culture, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> 
                                reflects an awareness of professional roles and public voices. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> is aware that landscape artists like 
                                <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName> and <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName> traveled the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName> 
                                in search of subjects both for exhibition in watercolor or oil and for wider distribution in engraving and lithography. He is practicing the complementary, 
                                ekphrastic role of the letterpress writer, who provides on&#x2010;demand descriptive and historical verse or prose, in a voice that is variously authoritative or facetious, 
                                and that does not necessarily depend for its authority on a personal acquaintance with the place being described. He is exploring style not only as a resource for artistic self&#x2010;expression 
                                but also as a means of differentiation in the artistic market: he notices how stylistic differences accompany the roles 
                                assigned to <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>, <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>, and <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>; 
                                and while his invariable model for verse remains the octosyllabic couplets of <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s narrative poems, 
                                he at least tries out strategies for ekphrastic and topographical description borrowed from <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> (whose voice for learning and anecdote he cannot match).</p>
                            <p>In forming the persona <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">J.R.</persName>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was influenced not only by literary and artistic sources, 
                                but also by living poets and artists whom he was fortunate to meet or correspond with during his conceptualization and composition of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>. 
                                These contacts became especially important as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was &#x201C;brought forward&#x201D; as a professional contributor to

                            <p>The personae of <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> and <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> each exhibited multiple and even contradictory sides, and the Ruskins must have been selective 
                                about what aspects of these public figures they hoped to cultivate in the patronage of their precocious son. 
                                Respecting <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>, the Ruskins thought of him in his role as the <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JH">Ettrick Shepherd</persName>, who was romantically imagined as having received his call to poetry 
                                when he was shepherd in <placeName corresp="#ETTRICK">Ettrick Forest</placeName> in the <placeName corresp="SCOTTISHBORDERS">Scottish Borders</placeName>, 
                                and who still resided in georgic retirement on his farm in the <geogName corresp="#YARROWVALLEY">Yarrow Valley</geogName>. 
                                The Ruskins would have played down <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s colorful and risqu&#x00E9; character in the <title type="essay" corresp="#NOCTESAMBROSIANAE">&#x201C;Noctes Ambrosianae&#x201D;</title>

                                who imitated the bravado and swagger of these dialogues in their own collaborative and competitive writing, 
                                but <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s parents would hardly have considered such a persona as an appropriate model 
                                for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s solitary and decorous authorship.</p>
                            <p>When the Ruskins met <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> personally in <date when="1832">1832</date>, he was undertaking his first visit to the metropolis, 
                                where he was lionized by <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> society. <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s introduction to the Ruskins came by way of the community of expatriate Scottish literati in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> 
                                who surrounded the publishing firms of <orgName corresp="#MURRAY">John Murray</orgName> and <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>. The latter, in particular, as the publisher of

                            <p><persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>, in sharp contrast with <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>, was the urbane &#x201C;man of taste,&#x201D; whose townhouse in <placeName corresp="#STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</placeName> 
                                was a showplace of exquisitely curated Regency neoclassicism, and the scene of his famous breakfasts at which <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> acted the part of social arbiter 
                                of the current <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> artistic and literary scene. In his most positive light, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> might have appeared to the Ruskins as a splendid embodiment 
                                of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s tastes and aspirations. A former associate of <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName>, and a habitu&#x00E9; of at least the byways of fame, 
                                <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> had earned a sound reputation for his poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSPLEASURES"><hi rend="italic">The Pleasures of Memory</hi></title> (<date when="1792">1792</date>), 
                                and, more recently, <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>. The latter may have paled in the popular glare of 
                                <title type="poem" corresp="#BYRONPILGRIMAGE"><hi rend="italic">Childe Harold&#x02BC;s Pilgrimage</hi></title>, but the poem was respectably and approachably 
                                neoclassical, regular in its versification, and grounded in the tradition of the Grand Tour to <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>. 
                                <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> was also, like <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>, a successful businessman, having made his fortune in banking; 
                                and even though he lavished extravagant sums on artists, engravers, and printers in order to satisfy his perfectionism in crafting editions of his poetry, 
                                <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> recouped his huge investment in his illustrated edition of <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY1830"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> 
                                and profited handsomely by its unprecedented sales. The unattractive side of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> to the Ruskins would have been his notoriously acid wit and his worldliness at a time when middle&#x2010;class Evangelical earnestness 
                                was turning the tide on Regency profligacy.</p>
                            <p>The two writers also differed profoundly in taste. <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> was so committed to his neoclassicism that <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>

                                <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> and the more entrepreneurial and innovative, yet also volatile and confusing print culture 
                                in the age of <persName corresp="#CJHD">Dickens</persName>. In a time when critical discourse commonly bemoaned the decline of poetry in unpropitious circumstances 
                                (see, e.g., <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BRISTOWVICTORIANPOETINTRO">Bristow, &#x201C;Introduction,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Victorian Poet</hi></ref>, 4&#x2013;5), 
                                both <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> and <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> appreciated how poetry could gain new life from its relation with the visual arts&#x2014;a 
                                relation that was rooted in tradition reaching back to the humanist dialogue or <hi rend="italic">paragone</hi> between the sister arts, 
                                yet that was also undergoing renewal and transformation by mass&#x2010;market print technologies. Both men shrewdly exploited the changes in print technology 
                                that created new venues and audiences for literature and art, such as the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">annuals and other illustrated books</ref>.

                                concerning the youth&#x02BC;s audience with the poet can be read in terms of commonalities shared by these mentors in the literary and artistic culture of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>.

                                on the beauty of the engravings by which his poems were illustrated,&#x201D; indicating that the youth knew &#x201C;more of the vignettes 
                                [in <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY1830"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>] than the verses,&#x201D; and the consequent chiding by <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> &#x201C;that, in future,

                                evokes a bygone era that valued polite conversation and dilettantish collecting (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 34:96, 35:93). 
                                Yet, while <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> fits the anecdote into what he now regarded as his fatuous beginnings as a poet, his misplaced complements to the illustrator 
                                only proves him to have been a boy of his decade, who had so carefully studied the visual culture represented by <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY1830"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>. 
                                (While we do not know precisely when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s introduction to <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> occurred&#x2014;the

                                the poetry commissions for <title type="anthology" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>&#x2014;were these geological observations.

                                <persName corresp="#JCL">Loudon</persName>, like <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> and <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>, was a Scot&#x2014;a member of the extended &#x201C;family&#x201D;

                            as compared with the few "fragments" published in 1834 and 1850. To summarize, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> limited his edition to verse, 
                            whereas <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> were the first to represent 
                            the work as composite in genre, albeit curtailing reproduction of the drawings. Both editions, however, sought to complete the work beyond the version in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>, 
                            which Ruskin abandoned in the middle of fair-copying the section on "Heidelberg". Cook and Wedderburn's reconstruction relied heavily on Collingwood's for the conjectural ordering 
                            of the poems and essays that Ruskin left in draft, although the 1903 edition not only rejoined the poems that Collingwood had edited with their complementary prose essays, 
                            but also rescued poems and essays about places along the tour that Collingwood had neglected altogether.</p>
                        <p>For <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>, it was necessary to restore the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> 
                            to some degree of integrity in order to justify publishing the fragmentary work at all, given the conditions placed on his edition (probably by Ruskin himself, but Collingwood does not identify the source) 
                            of omitting "poems and passages as were either without general interest, or incomplete and inadequately representative of the author's attainments and style 
                            at the time" of composition. In <title type="book" corresp="JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, the author had rejected 
                            the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> as an &#x201C;unfinished folly&#x201D;, 
                            which "none but friends" should ever see. Collingwood interpreted this embargo as referring, "not to the literary quality of the verse"--the first condition 
                            for inclusion in an edition of the poetry--"but to the miscalculation and miscarriage of an ambitious project", thus stigmatizing the work on the grounds 
                            of the second condition. In defense, Collingwood pleaded for reconstructing the work from the &#x201C;rough copies&#x201D; of poems, 
                            which he was &#x201C;pretty certain . . . [<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>] was not aware of&#x201D; lying &#x201C;at the back of his book&#x2010;shelves&#x201D;

                            than literary, as indeed he introduced the entire edition of <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> as revealing "the ground-plan of [Ruskin's] character,--the

                            Collingwood did not complete the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, as he knew to be impossible. 
                            He was acquainted with the <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php"><title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan for Continuation</title></ref> 
                            that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> compiled on the back endpapers of MS VIII--"I find from a list at the end of No. VIII" that Ruskin "intended this volume 
                            to contain about 150 pieces of prose and poetry, and at least as many drawings!--but he was concerned only to use the draft poems to bring the reader to closure 
                            as a record of the tour, with Ruskin's impressions of Chamounix. He did not treat the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan for Continuation</title> 
                            as an authoritative constraint on how he arranged and even entitled the draft poems that he used to round out the work.</p>
                        
                        <p>Clearly, Collingwood did not consider himself bound by titles in the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan</title> 
                            for pieces that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did not fair-copy, even though a case could be made that corresponding draft, titled and untitled, 
                            could be identified. Collingwood instead invented titles that more effectively  Of course, one can argue that literary features 
                            of the "Account" influenced the narrative in Praeterita, but Collingwood stated that the latter possessed "a power of recollective imagination resembling Turner," 
                            while the use of the former was to document that "the account of the tour of Praeterita [is not] quite accurate," because, for example, "the travellers 
                            went to the west of Switzerland and the Oberland after being in Italy"

                            in his retitling of the draft poems, since their content can be associated with various titles in the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan</title>.

                            connect with three titles in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s list: <title type="composite" corresp="#JRSCHAFFHAUSENCOMP">&#x201C;Schaffhausen&#x201D;</title>, 
                            <title type="composite" corresp="#JRTHEALPSCOMP">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</title>, and <title type="composite" corresp="#JRFALLOFTHERHINECOMP">&#x201C;The Fall of the Rhine&#x201D;</title> 
                            (see the textual and contextual glosses to these poems). But the more significant connection between this draft poem and the titles in the list is the clue 
                            that the poem provides to the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan for Continuation of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> 
                            as a literary design, and not just a sequential list of places visited during the tour. </p>
                        <p>Collingwood, intent on presenting the "Account" more as a record of the 1833 tour than as Ruskin's literary and artistic apprenticeship (or, perhaps better said, 
                            assuming those two purposes to be identical), omitted the tale of Gough and his dog from "The Summit," presumably because he was offended by the intrusion of a Lake District 
                            story into an account of a Continental tour. On the same principle of treating the "Account" as a diary rather than as a literary construction, 
                            he misplaced <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title>, relegating it to the end of the sequence--between 
                            the poems about Italy and those about the finale of the tour, Chamounix in Switzerland--rather 
                            than where Ruskin's <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan for Continuation of the Account</title> explicitly 
                            situates the poem, as a preface to the series about crossing the Alps at Splugen. Collingwood's logic is clear enough: <persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName> 
                            descended on Italy through the western Alpine approach, the <geogName corresp="#SIMPLON">Simplon</geogName>, not the northern; however, such geographical and historical literalism misses the point of Ruskin's engagement 
                            with writers and artists in the "Account." Arguably, in situating <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title> as an introduction 
                            to Chamounix, Collingwood fulfilled Ruskin's idea, apparent in the Plan, to complement the series about crossing the Alps from the north with a reverse poetic series 
                            describing the crossing from the east in Italy:</p>
                        <p>Given Collingwood's indifference to the Plan, however, he evidence suggests that his approximation of Ruskins' intention was a happy accident.</p>
