                        Two decades earlier, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself had set the precedent for numbering the <title type="manuscript" corresp="REDBOOK">Red Books</title>, including this one: at bottom of the title page for &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="JREUDOSIA">Eudosia</title>,&#x201D; he wrote &#x201C;Red book No. 1. <date when="1870-08-09">Sept 8th 1870</date>&#x201D; (see &#x201C;Eudosia&#x201D;: Title). On the same day, he docketed <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIII"> MS III</title> as &#x201C;Red book No. 2,&#x201D; and <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSI">MS I</title> as &#x201C;Red book No. 3.&#x201D; For the meaning of this numbering, see Red Books. <!--NOTE is red_book_note.xml, how do I tag this-->

                    <p>  <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIV">MS IV</title> is like some other <title type="manuscript" corresp="JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title> (e.g., MS III and MS IIIA) in that it starts with a title page announcing a single work (see Title) but&#x2013;<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> failing to realize the ambitious length and predominance of that work—the manuscript was left open to being filled by other kinds of writing. <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIV">MS IV</title>, however, was left with an unusually large blank section: from the page containing the final fair-copied lines of &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="JREUDOSIA">Eudosia</title>&#x201D; 
                        (p. 17) to the Mineralogy Notes [ca. 1829] entered reverso from the other end, <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIV">MS IV</title> contained a section of 29 leaves, blank except for numbering on some pages, until two decades after its initial use, when <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> used some of those leaves for his catalog of his son&#x02BC;s published poems. 
                        Over time, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> put space in other Red Books to various uses&#x2013;the additional poetry anthologies in <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIII">MS III</title>, the mineralogy notes in <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIIIA">MS IIIA</title> (although that <title type="manuscript" corresp="JRREDBOOK">Red Book</title> also retained blank sections extending to significant lengths), the sermon drafts in <title type="manuscript" corresp="JUVMSA">Juvenilia MS A</title>. That <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> left so much of <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIV">MS IV</title> unused may suggest that he persisted longer in an intention to carry on with the manuscript&#x02BC;s main work,
                        &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="JREUDOSIA">Eudosia</title>,&#x201D; compared to ambitions for &#x201C;<title type="lesson" corresp="JRHARRYANDLUCY">Harry and Lucy</title>,&#x201D; which he relinquished more easily in <title type ="manuscript" corresp="MSIII">MS III</title> and <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIIIA">MS IIIA</title>. 
                        If so, his lingering ambitions for a long poem would be more expected than for Edgeworthian lessons, which he more quickly outgrew.
                        If <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin </persName>had devoted additional Red Books to further &#x201C;volumes&#x201D; of &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="JREUDOSIA">Eudosia</title>&#x201D;&#x2013;beyond the first volume he planned for <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIV">MS IV</title>, which he gave over to the subject of &#x201C;Botany&#x201D;&#x2013;he presumably would have continued to follow something like the plan found in his source, Lofft, Eudosia. 
                        Since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> subdivides his first volume of his &#x201C;Poem on the Universe&#x201D; into &#x201C;books&#x201D; (of which he never got beyond the start of book 2), he is even more ambitious than Lofft, whose &#x201C;Poem on the Universe&#x201D; is divided only into books (not volumes containing books), of which the first is &#x201C;The Earth,&#x201D; corresponding to Ruskin&#x02BC;s &#x201C;Botany.&#x201D;
                        It is possible that one of the fair&#x2010;copy versions of &#x201C;The Constellations: Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and Some of the Southern&#x201D;&#x2013;that in <title type ="manuscript" corresp="MSIA">MS IA</title>, or <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title>&#x2013;represents a continuation of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s scheme beyond the first volume in <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIV">MS IV</title>, as a volume on the stars would correspond to <persName corresp="#CL">Lofft</persName>&#x02BC;s poem: see <ref type="apparatus" target="eudosia_apparatus.php#DISCUSSION"><title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201C;Eudosia&#x201D;</title>: Discussion</ref>.</p>
