                    <p>What the speaker &#x201C;looks at&#x201D; when looking at the ship constitutes, in part, an observation about the apparent size of objects in relation to their distance. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drew this observation from a lesson in <title type="book" corresp="#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><hi rend="italic">The History of Sandford and Merton</hi></title> by <persName corresp="#TD">Thomas Day</persName>, 
                        in which the tutor, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName>, instructs <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy Merton</persName> to work out the relation of apparent size to distance 
                        by looking at ships at sea from than vantage of the shore. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy</persName> needs the lesson, having revealed the dependency of his thinking on appearances&#x2014;his 
                        assumption that the stars revolve, rather than the earth in relation to them; and that the stars must be smaller than the sun, 
                        given their relative appearance in the sky. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName> takes advantage of a walk by the sea to correct <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy</persName>&#x02BC;s assumptions. 
                        Lexical borrowings from this passage in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem prove that he based his poem on this passage.</p>

                        <p>they continued their excursion over the hills, till at last they came in sight of the sea.—As 
                            they were diverting themselves with the immense prospect of water that was before them, 
                            <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName> perceived something floating at a distance, so small as to be scarcely discernible by the eye. 
                            He pointed it out to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy</persName>, who with some difficulty was able to distinguish it, and asked him what he thought it was?</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy</persName> answered that he imagined it to be some little fishing boat; but could not well tell, on account of the distance.</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD"><hi rend="italic">Mr. Barlow</hi></persName>. If you do not then see a ship, what is it you do see, or what does that object appear to your eyes?</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD"><hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi></persName>. All that I can see is no more than a little dusky speck, which seems to grow bigger and bigger.</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD"><hi rend="italic">Mr. Barlow</hi></persName>. And what is the reason it grows bigger and bigger?</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD"><hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi></persName>. Because it comes nearer and nearer to me.</p> 
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD"><hi rend="italic">Mr. Barlow</hi></persName>. What, then, does the same thing some times appear small, and sometimes great?</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD"><hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi></persName>. Yes, sir, it seems small when it is at a great distance; for I have observed even houses and churches, 
                            when you are at some miles distant, seem to the eye very small indeed: and now I observe that the vessel is sailing towards us, 
                            and it is not, as I imagined, a little fishing boat, but a ship with a mast; for I begin to distinguish the sails.</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName> walked on a little while by the side of the sea; and presently <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy</persName> called out again: 
                            &#x2018;I protest, I was mistaken again; for it is not a vessel with one mast, as I thought a little while ago, 
                            but a fine large ship, with three great masts, and all her sails before the wind. 
                            I believe she must either be a large merchant&#x2010;mari or else a frigate&#x2019;</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD"><hi rend="italic">Mr. Barlow</hi></persName>. Will you then take notice of what you have now been saying? What was first only a little dusky speck 
                            became a vessel with one mast; and now this vessel with one mast plainly appears a ship of a very large size, 
                            with all her masts, and sails, and rigging complete. Yet all these three appearances are only the same object, 
                            at different distances from your eye.</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD"><hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi></persName>. Yes, sir; that is all very true indeed.</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD"><hi rend="italic">Mr. Barlow</hi></persName>. Why, them, if the ship, which is now full in sight, were to tack about again, and sail away from us 
                            as fast as she approached just now; what do you think would happen?</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="TOMMYTD"><hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi></persName>. It would grow less and less every minute till it appeared a speck again.</p>
