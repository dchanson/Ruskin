                    <p>What the speaker &#x201C;looks at&#x201D; when looking at the ship constitutes, in part, an observation about the apparent size of objects in relation to their distance. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drew this observation from a lesson in <title type="book" corresp="#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><hi rend="italic">The History of Sandford and Merton</hi></title> by <persName corresp="#TD">Thomas Day</persName>, 
                        in which the tutor, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName>, instructs <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy Merton</persName> to work out the relation of apparent size to distance 
                        by looking at ships at sea from than vantage of the shore. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy</persName> needs the lesson, having revealed the dependency of his thinking on appearances&#x2014;his 
                        assumption that the stars revolve, rather than the earth in relation to them; and that the stars must be smaller than the sun, 
                        given their relative appearance in the sky. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName> takes advantage of a walk by the sea to correct <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy</persName>&#x02BC;s assumptions. 
                        Lexical borrowings from this passage in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem prove that he based his poem on this passage.</p>

                        <p>they continued their excursion over the hills, till at last they came in sight of the sea.&#x2014;As 
                            they were diverting themselves with the immense prospect of water that was before them, 
                            <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName> perceived something floating at a distance, so small as to be scarcely discernible by the eye. 
                            He pointed it out to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy</persName>, who with some difficulty was able to distinguish it, and asked him what he thought it was?</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy</persName> answered that he imagined it to be some little fishing boat; but could not well tell, on account of the distance.</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD"><hi rend="italic">Mr. Barlow</hi></persName>. If you do not then see a ship, what is it you do see, or what does that object appear to your eyes?</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD"><hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi></persName>. All that I can see is no more than a little dusky speck, which seems to grow bigger and bigger.</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD"><hi rend="italic">Mr. Barlow</hi></persName>. And what is the reason it grows bigger and bigger?</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD"><hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi></persName>. Because it comes nearer and nearer to me.</p> 
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD"><hi rend="italic">Mr. Barlow</hi></persName>. What, then, does the same thing sometimes appear small, and sometimes great?</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD"><hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi></persName>. Yes, sir, it seems small when it is at a great distance; for I have observed even houses and churches, 
                            when you are at some miles distant, seem to the eye very small indeed: and now I observe that the vessel is sailing towards us, 
                            and it is not, as I imagined, a little fishing boat, but a ship with a mast; for I begin to distinguish the sails.</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName> walked on a little while by the side of the sea; and presently <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy</persName> called out again: 
                            &#x2018;I protest, I was mistaken again; for it is not a vessel with one mast, as I thought a little while ago, 
                            but a fine large ship, with three great masts, and all her sails before the wind. 
                            I believe she must either be a large merchant&#x2010;man or else a frigate.&#x2019;</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD"><hi rend="italic">Mr. Barlow</hi></persName>. Will you then take notice of what you have now been saying? What was first only a little dusky speck 
                            became a vessel with one mast; and now this vessel with one mast plainly appears a ship of a very large size, 
                            with all her masts, and sails, and rigging complete. Yet all these three appearances are only the same object, 
                            at different distances from your eye.</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD"><hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi></persName>. Yes, sir; that is all very true indeed.</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD"><hi rend="italic">Mr. Barlow</hi></persName>. Why, then, if the ship, which is now full in sight, were to tack about again, and sail away from us 
                            as fast as she approached just now; what do you think would happen?</p>
                        <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="TOMMYTD"><hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi></persName>. It would grow less and less every minute till it appeared a speck again.</p>
