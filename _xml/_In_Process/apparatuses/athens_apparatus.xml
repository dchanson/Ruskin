                    <p>Above the first line of the first four stanzas of draft in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> (pp. 1&#x2013;2), <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> inserted the title, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> in pencil, 
                        although he composed the draft itself in ink, suggesting that he considered the title to be tentative. 
                        He was apparently having difficulty making up his mind. 
                        On the back endpaper of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, he wrote a note to himself clearly referring to the fifth stanza of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title>, 
                        in which he names the poem <!--Needs tagging?-->&#x201C;Persiad&#x201D;&#x2014;no doubt an invention that refers to the poem&#x02BC;s subject of the <date notBefore="-0499" notAfter="-0449">Persian Wars</date>. 
                        This title, using the classical suffix, complements <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s title for his earlier epic poem, 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="iteriad_apparatus.html"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title></ref>.<!-- DCH to self: create file for this endpaper note as marginalia or work? -->
                    </p> 
                    <p>The title appears to have remained tentative at least until <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> reached the draft of the tenth stanza in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, 
                        where he boldly wrote <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> 
                        above the stanza in ink, with no indication that he inserted this title later than the draft itself 
                        (stanzas 10&#x2013;12 composed <date notBefore="1831-12-01" notAfter="1832-01-31">between December 1831 and January 1832</date>; see <ref type="internal" target="DATE">Date</ref>). 
                        Nonetheless, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> used no title for his fair copy in <ref type="apparatus" target="msv_apparatus.html">MS V</ref>, which he made shortly after completing draft of the first eighteen stanzas, 
                        toward the end of <date when="1832-01">January 1832</date>. The fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, which is probably earlier, made in <date when="1831-12">December 1831</date>, likewise lacks a title contemporary with its production 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>). Both of these fair copies carry the title <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> in pencil, 
                        but the hand is probably <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s from a much later time, when he was preparing his edition, 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.html"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)</title></ref>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Of the fair copies, only <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title> presents a title. Even this manuscript&#x02BC;s elaborate title page (59r) leaves options partly open, however, 
                        by naming the work &#x201C;ATHENS / or the&#x201D;, with the subtitle left incomplete, and with the ornamented lettering for <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;ATHENS&#x201D;</title> 
                        left incompletely traced in ink over top of the penciled design. 
                        (The design matches that for the title page of 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="iteriad_apparatus.html"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title></ref>, also contained in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>.)

                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s progress in composing <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> can be dated reasonably closely since he entered stanzas intermittently in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> relative to other dateable poems 
                        in the <date notBefore="1831" notAfter="1832">1831&#x2013;33</date> section of this notebook. His composition of this mix of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> stanzas along with shorter poems appears sequential, 
                        but caveats are justified in places, which would complicate the chronology  
                        (see <ref type="apparatus" target="msviii_apparatus.html#SECTIONA"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>: Contents, Section <hi rend="italic">a</hi></ref>).
                    </p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> probably started work on <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> in late <date notBefore="1831-08" notAfter="1831">August or September 1831</date>, 
                        given that the first portion of draft in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, stanzas 1&#x2013;4, precedes a section of 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title>, book 4, lines 297&#x2013;320, which he likely composed in <date when="1831-09">September</date>. Previously, he had been drafting <title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title> in another notebook, 
                        <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title>, which is likewise devoted to rough draft, and in which he refers to <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> as the &#x201C;new manuscript&#x201D; 
                        (see <ref type="apparatus" target="iteriad_apparatus.html#DATE"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title>: Date</ref> and

                        In <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, however, the <title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title> draft appears neatly self&#x2010;contained on its page (p. 3), 
                        an appearance suggesting the possibility that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> entered this passage in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> first, 
                        and then wrapped the other poetry (including the opening <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> stanzas) 
                        on pp. 1&#x2013;2 and pp. 4&#x2013;6 around it. Even so, this possibility might affect the chronology only in throwing the <title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title> draft 
                        back in time prior to the Ruskin family&#x02BC;s departure for the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1831_note.html">Tour of 1831</ref>

                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> reflects on that experience in many of the poems of

                    <p>The first poem in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> to be dated explicitly in the manuscript is

                        which <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> glossed as &#x201C;Oct&#x201D;.

                        an October date tends to confirm August or September for the inception of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title>. 
                        <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s gloss, however, may refer to a revision of this poem a year later; see the details about the

                        (p. 14), which he could have composed anytime between <date notBefore="1831-12" notAfter="1832-01">December 1831 and January 1832</date>. 
                        Thus, after beginning <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> in <date notBefore="1831-08" notAfter="1831-09">August or September 1831</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> returned to the poem by the end of the year or start of the next.

                    <p>Having resumed, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> continued to alternate stanzas of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> with shorter poems throughout this period

                    <p>After a brief hiatus from &#x201C;Athens&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> resumed the poem in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> with stanza 19 (pp. 28&#x2013;29). 
                        This single stanza follows <ref type="the_song_of_the_southern_breeze_apparatus.html"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESONGOFTHESOUTHERNBREEZE">&#x201C;The Song of the Southern Breeze&#x201D;</title></ref> (pp. 26&#x2013;28),

                        Stanza 19 is succeeded by drafts of three more poems

                        and then <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> is taken up with draft of a poem that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was preparing in advance of his father&#x02BC;s <date when="1832-05-10">10 May 1832 birthday</date>,

                        How far in advance of that anniversary <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was working cannot be established with certainty, 
                        except that the possible period of composition for all these poems, starting with stanza 19 of &#x201C;Athens&#x201D;, stretches from <date notBefore="1832-02" notAfter="1832-05-10">mid&#x2010;February to May 10</date>.
                    </p> 
                    <p>Finally, there follows a cluster formed by the last known stanzas of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> to be composed (or, at least, the last to have survived) mixed with a few other poems: 
                        stanzas 20&#x2013;21 (pp. 37&#x2013;38), which are followed by three miscellaneous poems 
                        (<ref type="apparatus" target="aspice_pater_invocationem_apparatus.html"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRASPICEPATERINVOCATIONEM">&#x201C;Aspice pater invocationem&#x201D;</title></ref> [p. 38],

                        and then by one final, unnumbered stanza (p. 41). Possible fault lines run before and after this cluster, or even between poems within the cluster, 
                        which would open up differing scenarios for dating. The most likely scenario, however, is that this final cluster belongs to the same period, 
                        <date notBefore="1832-02-15" notAfter="1832-05-15">mid&#x2010;February to mid&#x2010;May</date>, that also comprises the preceding cluster starting with stanza 19 and leading up to draft of the birthday poem for <persName corresp="JJR">John James</persName>.
                    </p> 
                    <p>For the final cluster containing the three final known stanzas of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title>, 
                        two clear benchmarks for dating are formed, on the cluster&#x02BC;s earlier end, by the draft of the birthday poem for <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>, and, 
                        on its other end, by

                        (pp. 41&#x2013;42). In <title type="poem" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> dated the latter as <date when="1832-09">September 1832</date>, for it refers to the death of

                        The intervening gap of time was filled in part by the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1832.html">Tour of 1832</ref>, 
                        a family holiday in <placeName corresp="#DOVER">Dover</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName>, which extended from <date notBefore="1832-05-22" notAfter="1832-07-19">22 May through 19 July</date>. At what point respecting this final <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> cluster did the holiday intervene?
                    </p>
                    <p>The physical evidence is inconclusive. 
                        It is reassuring for the larger picture thus far formed of 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="msviii_apparatus.html#SECTIONA"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>: Contents, Section <hi rend="italic">a</hi></ref> 
                        that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> revised his page numbering system immediately following this final cluster of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> installments. 
                        From the start of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, he had numbered versos with odd numbers, 
                        but he changed to the more conventional numbering of rectos with odd numbers starting with p. 45, by omitting a p. 44 
                        (see <ref type="apparatus" target="msviii_apparatus.html#DESCRIPTION"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>: Description</ref>). 
                        This facing&#x2010;page spread of p. 43 and p. 45 contains 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="song_i_weary_for_the_torrent_leaping_apparatus.html"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRSONGIWEARY">&#x201C;Song&#x201D; (&#x201C;I weary for the torrent leaping&#x201D;</title>)</ref>, 
                        and the previous spread, pp. 41&#x2013;42, contains the final, unnumbered stanza of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> followed by the <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> elegy. 
                        Had <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> changed his numbering on the latter spread, pp. 41&#x2013;42, one would be more confident in asserting that the gap in time fell here, 
                        dividing the <date when="1832-09">September 1832</date> elegy from the final stanza of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title>&#x2014;and indeed, the <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> stanza 
                        appears written using a different pen and/or ink than the poems surrounding it on that spread.
                    </p> 
                    <p>All in all, two possibilities seem most likely. One is to locate the two&#x2010;month gap on pp. 41&#x2013;42, 
                        despite <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s change in numbering coming afterward, on the spread formed by p. 43 and p. 45, 
                        since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did indicate at least an awareness of the numbering anomaly on the preceding spread, pp. 39&#x2013;40, 
                        where he marked the recto page number 40 either by striking through the zero or by overwriting it with a numeral 1 
                        (see <ref type="apparatus" target="msviii_apparatus.html#DESCRIPTION"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>: Description</ref>). 
                        Since the poem on this spread, 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="they_woke_them_from_their_couch_of_rest_apparatus.html"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEYWOKETHEMFROMTHEIRCOUCH">&#x201C;They woke them from their couch of rest&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        spills over onto p. 41 (verso), followed by the unnumbered <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> stanza, 
                        the physical evidence of that flagged numeral 40 lends some credence to interpreting the following spread as the watershed, 
                        dividing the final <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> stanza from the <date when="1832-09">September</date> elegy by the gap representing 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1832.html">Tour of 1832</ref>.
                    </p> 
                    <p>That same evidence of the flagged numeral 40 also supports a second interpretation, 
                        identifying <ref type="apparatus" target="they_woke_them_from_their_couch_of_rest_apparatus.html"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEYWOKETHEMFROMTHEIRCOUCH">&#x201C;They woke them from their couch of rest&#x201D;</title></ref> 
                        (pp. 39&#x2013;41) as the first poem in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> on the far side of the summer journey, 
                        along with the lone, unnumbered <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> stanza (p. 41) and the <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> elegy (pp. 41&#x2013;42). 
                        This interpretation is supported not only by the physical evidence, which situates <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s first flagging of the numbering anomaly at the point of homecoming, 
                        but also by the content of 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="they_woke_them_from_their_couch_of_rest_apparatus.html"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEYWOKETHEMFROMTHEIRCOUCH">&#x201C;They woke them from their couch of rest&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        which is a poem about the Scottish highlands. It is written in a distinctly darker ink and using a blunter pen than 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="llyn_idwal_apparatus.html"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRLLYNIDWAL">&#x201C;Llyn Idwal&#x201D;</title></ref> (pp. 38&#x2013;39), 
                        which is a poem about <placeName corresp="#WALES">Wales</placeName>, and which is written in a lighter and finer pen and ink. 
                        This second interpretation divides the final known <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> stanza, which is titled <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> but unnumbered, 
                        from the previous <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> stanzas 20&#x2013;21, which are both titled and numbered in the manuscript. 
                        These stanzas on pp. 37&#x2013;38 are also composed in the same lighter, finer pen and ink as that used for 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="aspice_pater_invocationem_apparatus.html"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRASPICEPATERINVOCATIONEM">&#x201C;Aspice pater invocationem&#x201D;</title></ref> (p. 38)

                    </p> 
                    <p>The appeal of the second interpretation is that, by placing the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1832.html">Tour of 1832</ref> 
                        on pp. 39&#x2013;40, between <ref type="apparatus" target="llyn_idwal_apparatus.html"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRLLYNIDWAL">&#x201C;Llyn Idwal&#x201D;</title></ref> (pp. 38&#x2013;39) and

                        one perceives a separation between the Welsh scenery that had dominated the poems written between <date notBefore="1831-08" notAfter="1832-05">August&#x2010;September 1831 and May 1832</date>, 
                        hearkening back to the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1831.html">Tour of 1831</ref>,
                        and the Scottish and Lake District scenery that dominated the poems written after <date notBefore="1832-07" notAfter="1832-08">July or August 1832</date>&#x2014;including the poem or poems marking <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s death. 
                        By situating the final known stanza of &#x201C;Athens&#x201D; among the latter, this reading hypothesizes the briefest renewal of the project&#x2014;the unnumbered 
                        stanza possibly signaling a start on a second canto just prior to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s abandoning the poem for good.
                    </p>
                    <p>Tending to confirm this interpretation for dating the final <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> cluster is the presence of other themes in this group of letters, <date notBefore="1832-01" notAfter="1832-02">January&#x2010;March 1832</date>,

                    <p>In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s mind, his composition of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> was closely associated with his immediately preceding work on the epic,

                    <p>The intermittent composition of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athen&#x201D;</title> in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>&#x2014;of which an account is already laid out above, in the argument for

                    <p>The <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> fair copy is a folded sheet containing seven stanzas. The stanzas are unnumbered, 
                        and the copyist&#x02BC;s hand appears to be <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s. The manuscript is undated and cannot be dated by physical evidence; 
                        however, several factors point to <date notBefore="1831-09" notAfter="1831-12">late 1831</date>, making this version the earliest of the fair copies. 
                        On the evidence of dating the draft in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had drafted the first nine stanzas of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> by <date when="1831-12">December 1831</date>. 
                        The <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> version probably belongs to the same period, since it is untitled, 
                        whereas the earliest draft appearing to have been entitled confidently in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> is stanza 10, from <date notBefore="1831-12-15" notAfter="1832-01">late December 1831 or January 1832</date> 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="TITLE">Title</ref>). 
                        (At the top of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> is written in pencil; however, the hand, which does not resemble any of the Ruskins&#x02BC;, appears to be <persName corresp="#WGC">W.

                    </p> 
                    <p>The purpose of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> copy may be indicated by its probable dating of <date when="1831-12">December</date>, suggesting the intention of a 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="new_years_poems_note.html">New Year&#x02BC;s poem</ref>. 
                        The works itself is obviously not an occasional poem of this kind, however, and no other such presentation is known in <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s hand. 
                        Typically, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> produced fair copies to send to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> while he was traveling, 
                        but no family letters survive between <date notBefore="1831-05" notAfter="1832-01-15">May 1831 and mid&#x2010;January 1832</date> to help confirm this possible purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>The fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> was made by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, and it contains seventeen stanzas, numbered by him. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> cannot have started making this copy earlier than 
                        the fair copy of <ref type="apparatus" target="sonnet_to_a_cloud_apparatus.html"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRSONNETTOACLOUD">&#x201C;Sonnet to a Cloud&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        which precedes the fair copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title>. In <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft, this <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSONNETTOACLOUD">&#x201C;Sonnet&#x201D;</title> falls between the draft of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> stanzas 10&#x2013;12 and 
                        the draft of stanzas 13&#x2013;18&#x2014;the whole of this segment of this draft of stanzas 10&#x2013;18 being attributed to between <date notBefore="1831-12" notAfter="1832-01">December 1831 to January 1832</date>. 
                        That <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> made this <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> fair copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> immediately following draft composition through stanza 18 
                        accords well with what follows the fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title>&#x2014;namely, 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="sonnet_to_the_morning_apparatus.html"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRSONNETTOTHEMORNING">&#x201C;Sonnet to the Morning&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> dated <date when="1832-02-05">5 February [1832]</date> in its <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft, and 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="the_song_of_the_southern_breeze_apparatus.html"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESONGOFTHESOUTHERNBREEZE">&#x201C;The Song of the Southern Breeze&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        which he dated <date when="1832-02-12">12 February [1832]</date> in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>. Tending to confirm this reconstruction of the sequence of drafting and fair copying, stanza 19 of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title>, 
                        which is not included in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> version, 
                        appears in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft immediately following 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="the_song_of_the_southern_breeze_apparatus.html"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESONGOFTHESOUTHERNBREEZE">&#x201C;The Song of the Southern Breeze&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                        Thus, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> resumed draft soon after he had completed the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> fair copy of the first 18 stanzas.
                    </p>
                    <p>The discrepancy between the total number of seventeen stanzas in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> and the eighteen available in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> up to the point of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s fair&#x2010;copying 
                        is explained by the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> version having dropped the fifth stanza of the draft in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, 
                        causing the sixth stanza of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> to become the fifth in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title>. 
                        Thereafter, the stanza numbering in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> always lags behind <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> by one. 
                        The final stanza to be fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title>, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRXVII">&#x201C;XVII&#x201D;</title>, is thus the eighteenth stanza of draft in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>. 
                        The missing stanza is present in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> and in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>.
                    </p> 
                    <p>In <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, one stanza, originally the sixth, was completely cancelled. 
                        This, however, is not the stanza dropped from <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title>, and the cancellation has no necessary bearing on the other discrepancies between the two versions. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself may or may not have been responsible for this cancellation. 
                        The stanza is scored in pencil, perhaps by the same hand that had penciled in a word in that same stanza&#x2014;a hand that appears closer to <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s than <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s.
                    </p>
                    <p>If <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> made her <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> copy in <date when="1831-12">December 1831</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> made his soon afterward, in <date when="1832-01">January 1832</date>; 
                        and in both copies the poem remained untitled. 
                        (Again, the title appears in pencil, but in the same hand, probably <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s, that docketed the copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>.) 
                        Each of these versions contains minor variants in wording and punctuation compared to the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft, 
                        and these variants are peculiar to their respective manuscripts, showing no influence of one on the other. 
                        This independence is very clear in the final stanza to be copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, stanza 7, 
                        in which <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> followed the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft much more closely than did <persName corresp="#JJR">John</persName> in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title>. 
                        Nonetheless, it is clear that <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> uses the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft as copytext for the first seven stanzas, not the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> copy 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#TEXTUALNOTE">Textual Note</ref>).
                    </p>
                    <p>The missing fifth stanza in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> appears to have involved some struggle in composition. 
                        In <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> fair copy, the ninth line of the fifth stanza reads: &#x201C;But wake not those below their foam who lie&#x201D; 
                        (<hi rend="italic">their</hi> referring to the ocean &#x201C;billows&#x201D;).
                        Beneath &#x201C;wake&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> penciled in an alternate version of the line, &#x201C;them&#x2014;they sleep eternally&#x201D;. 
                        The alternate revives a version of the line that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had rejected in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft: 
                        &#x201C;But wake not <del rend="strikethrough"> them they sleep eternally</del>&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> replacing the deletion with &#x201C;those below their foam who lie&#x201D; inserted above the line. 
                        On the back endpaper of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> dwelled on the issue with a memorandum: 
                        &#x201C;For line 9th Verse 5th Persiad (But wake not those below <del rend="strikethrough">its breast who</del> their foam that lie&#x201D;&#x2014;with 
                        &#x201C;their foam that&#x201D; added to replace the deletion. No evidence settles the enticing question of whether the difficulty with this line 
                        caused <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to omit the fifth stanza from <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> altogether. 
                        In <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>, he accepted what may have been his mother&#x02BC;s preference: &#x201C;But wake not them: They sleep eternally&#x201D;. 
                        He also carried on with the fair&#x2010;copying for only four more lines into the sixth stanza, before abandoning this version.
                    </p>
                    <p>Beyond the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> version, which is the longest of the fair&#x2010;copy texts, the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft carries on for four more stanzas. 
                        These were never fair&#x2010;copied, so far as we know. The final stanza to be composed in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> stands alone, and it is unnumbered. 
                        Its generalized descriptive content gives no indication about where in the epic it should fit. 
                        Its first line, &#x201C;The sunset shone upon the isles of Greece&#x201D;, reads like a new opening. 
                        Perhaps <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> thought of the stanza as the opening of a projected second canto.
                    </p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> cannot have commenced the fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title> earlier than the preceding fair copy of

                        when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> he put his final orthographical flourish to the &#x201C;Finis&#x201D; 
                        (see <ref type="apparatus" target="iteriad_apparatus.html#DATE"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title>: Date</ref>). 
                        Even then, the task remained of adding the &#x201C;notes&#x201D; to the earlier poem, 
                        as he admitted in a <ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1832-01-14_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="#jr_to_jjr_1832-01-14"><date when="1832-01-14">14 January 1832</date> letter</title></ref>, promising to append them &#x201C;in such a style that the company shall stare&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 259).
                    </p>
                    <p>By the time he finished fair&#x2010;copying <title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title> in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>, therefore, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had probably completed the first eighteen stanzas of draft for <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title>, 
                        which he used as copytext for the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> version. Since he fair&#x2010;copied the latter in <date notBefore="1832-01-15" notAfter="1832-02-14">late January or early February 1832</date>, 
                        shortly following the drafting of the poem through that point, 
                        logic suggests that he started the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title> version no earlier than his resumption of the draft with stanza 19, after <date when="1832-02-12">12 February 1832</date>. 
                        By this time, he was able to head his fair copy with at least a partial title.
                    </p>
                    <p>How long after mid&#x2010;February <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have started this new fair copy cannot be determined with physical or textual evidence. 
                        He fair&#x2010;copied only five stanzas and the first four lines of the sixth, and the punctuation variants bear little relation to the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> and <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> versions. 
                        The most significant variant is the inclusion in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title> of the fifth stanza in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> omitted from the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> fair copy. Again, 
                        logic suggests that <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title> is a later version than <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title>, in that <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title> makes this correction (and extends the text only so far as to confirm this correction). 
                        Admittedly, the window of time available in the <date notBefore="1832-01-15" notAfter="1832-01-31">second half of January</date> might allow a hypothesis of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> version as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s preferred text, 
                        deliberately excluding the fifth stanza that he had already fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>. 
                        This scenario seems unlikely, however, since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was in fact sorely pressed for time to fit in his many activities. 
                        If in his &#x201C;former letters, the great subject is want of time&#x201D;, he wrote to his father on <ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1832-02-20_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="#jr_to_jjr_1832-02-20"><date when="1832-02-20">20 February 1832</date></title></ref>, 
                        he found &#x201C;it now still more scarce than ever for what with [his lessons in] <persName corresp="#LIVY">Livy</persName>, and <persName corresp="#LUCIAN">Lucian</persName>, <persName corresp="#HOMER">Homer</persName>, French, Drawing, Arithmetic, globe work, &#x0026; mineralogical dictionary, 
                        I positively am all flurry, all hurry, never a moment in which there is not something that ought to be done&#x201D;. 
                        As for poetry, he was &#x201C;sorry to inform&#x201D; his father on <ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1832-02-27_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="#jr_to_jjr_1832-02-27"><date when="1832-02-27">27 February</date></title></ref> that, since <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> had been away from home traveling for orders 
                        (since <date when="1832-02-19">19 February</date>, at the latest), <persName type="fictional_person" corresp="#PEGASUS">Pegasus</persName> had &#x201C;flown so high, that I am unable to follow it, &#x0026; the reinless <persName type="fictional_person" corresp="#PEGASUS">Pegaus</persName> has left me hurled from his too lofty back

                        again I shall ride on the Pegasian wing&#x201D;

                    </p>
                    <p>Even when <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> returned home, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poetry composition and appear to have been checked, 
                        with the traditional birthday ode for his father recycling material from the previous year&#x02BC;s birthday poem, 
                        and the version of the poem in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> apparently representing a collaborative composition between father and son 
                        (see <ref type="apparatus" target="twelve_months_all_rolling_round_have_past_apparatus.html"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTWELVEMONTHSALLROLLINGROUND">&#x201C;Twelve months all rolling round have past&#x201D;</title></ref>). 
                        Fair&#x2010;copying, too, evidently became mired. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did not continue any fair&#x2010;copying at all in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title>, beyond <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> and the two following poems, 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="sonnet_to_the_morning_apparatus.html"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRSONNETTOTHEMORNING">&#x201C;Sonnet to the Morning&#x201D;</title></ref> and

                        dated <date notBefore="1832-02-05" notAfter="1832-02-12">5 and 12 February</date>, respectively, in draft.
                    </p>
                    <p>While it is possible, therefore, that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have taken up <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> in its <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title> fair copy well after the period of the poem&#x02BC;s composition, 
                        which appears to have been arrested prior to the family&#x02BC;s departure for <placeName corresp="#DOVER">Dover</placeName> on <date when="1832-05-22">22 May 1832</date>, 
                        the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title> version&#x02BC;s state of incompletion combined with increasing ambition&#x2014;the verso of its incomplete title page 
                        announcing in light pencil the division, &#x201C;Canto First&#x201D; (59v), and the facing page declaring in light pencil &#x201C;THE ARGUMENT&#x201D; (60r), 
                        which was never added&#x2014;suggest that this collapse in plans belongs to the same period as the other fragmented projects in the <date notBefore="1832-01" notAfter="1832-05">first five months of 1832</date>. 
                        This interpretation seems consistent with <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s possible message in 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="aspice_pater_invocationem_apparatus.html"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRASPICEPATERINVOCATIONEM">&#x201C;Aspice pater invocationem&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        composed as part of the final cluster containing <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> draft&#x2014;stanzas 20&#x2013;21 and the final unnumbered stanza. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s meaning in this Latin poem is obscure, but he appears to beg his father for a new &#x201C;quarto&#x201D;&#x2014;that is, possibly, for a new notebook or ledger, 
                        like the one devoted to the fair copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title> (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>). 
                        The Latin poem does not mention <title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title> specifically, but its classical epic style (&#x201C;Aspice, pater, invocationem&#x201D;) 
                        suggests that he wanted a fresh notebook in order to fair&#x2010;copy his new epic. 
                        Apparently, he did not receive this &#x201C;boon&#x201D;, since he used <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title> itself to begin his new fair copy.

                        is not mentioned in the poem, which reflects little knowledge of its Herodotean subject.

                        Even more peculiarly, in the middle stanzas, 12&#x2013;16, 
                        the style veres markedly from the Byronic to the Wordsworthian, showing the influence of <title type="poem" corresp="#WORDSWORTHTHEEXCURSION"><hi rend="italic">The Excursion</hi></title> in general,
