                    <p>It is safe to assign this and three other examples of sermon notes in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title> to the first quarter of the year, 
                        when several references to sermon note&#x2010;taking are made in the family letters. In <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title> itself, moreover, 
                        the sermon notes are mixed in with drafts of poetry (<title type="poem" corresp="#JRMAY">&#x201C;May&#x201D;</title>) for <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1829-05-10">May 10</date> birthday.

                    <p>Quoted Ruskin, Works, 1:xxvi n. 1.</p>
                    
                    <p>It is difficult to pin down precisely which sermon notes--the present one, &#x201C;A Sermon&#x201D;[&#x201C;beautful allegory&#x201D;], &#x201C;A Theme&#x201D;, or 45--correspond to the references in the letters. 
                        After the first reference on January 19, which may or may not correspond to &#x201C;A Sermon,&#x201D; Ruskin next reports on Saturday, 21 February 1829, 
                        that he was &#x201C;only at the 1st head of last Sundays sermon&#x201D;. On the next day, &#x201C;Doctor Andrews preached such a delightful sermon . . . 
                        Mary and I thought that we remembered a great deal but when we came to write it down we found that we did not remember so much as we thought&#x201D;. 
                        On <date when="1829-03-04">4 March 1829</date>, <persName corresp="#MAB">Margaret</persName> refers to Ruskin writing “a novel &#x0026; a Sermon both as far as they have gone very tolerable I assure you” 
                        (RFL, 178, 179, 185; the “novel” refers to &#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;).</p>
                    
                    <p>That John and Mary “did not remember much” is reflected in the brevity and fragmentation of all four sermon pieces.</p>

                    <head type="section">Discussion</head>
                    <p>In apparently the first reference to noting down sermons he heard in chapel, 
                        Ruskin wrote on <date when="1829-01-19">19 January 1829</date> to his father about “a beautiful Sermon” by Dr. Andrews, 
                        which he and his cousin, <persName corresp="MBR">Mary Richardson</persName>, “are putting . . . down as well as we can for you to look at when you come home” (RFL, 173). 
                        That the sermon abstract that they put down refers to one of fragments in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title> is supported by the draft of a letter to Mrs. Monro, 
                        also copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title>, which mentions that “of late I began to attend to [Andrews’s] sermons and write them in a book at home”. 
                        The "book" may refer to this handmade pamphlet.
                        (this letter and the <date when="1829-01-19">January 19</date> letter to his father also correspond in mentioning an identical incident of the children meeting Andrews in the street).
