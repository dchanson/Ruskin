                        This description matches that in the catalogue for the sale from which <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> acquired the manuscript collection, 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1931">Sotheby &#x0026; Co., <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Final Portion of the Manuscripts &#x0026; Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, 
                        which lists the item as no. II, lot 27 (p. 6), consisting of &#x201C;early poetry and prose writings&#x201D;, which were &#x201C;all bound in cloth&#x201D;.</p>
                    
                    <p>The loss of this binding is not significant in itself, since, as <persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName> remarks on his holograph <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="WEDDERBURNMSIATITLE">title page</title> for <title type="manuscropt" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, 
                        the collection had &#x201C;been bound since the publication of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891">Poems</title> in <date when="1891">1891</date>&#x201D; 
                        (i.e., <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [<date when="1891">1891</date>]</title></ref>), 
                        and the compilation appears to have been governed by no rationale other than ordering the contents chronologically according to the editors&#x02BC; dating. 
                        The manuscripts originally collected in the binding are miscellaneous, suggesting that the editors gathered togetehr odds and ends, and numbered and inserted the resulting collection 
                        into <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s bibliography between <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title> and <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS II</title>

                    <p>Perhaps the folio was disassembled from its binding as a consequence of damage from <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s fire, 
                        but in his letter to <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName> (see <ref type="internal" target="#PROVENANCE">Provenance</ref>), 
                        <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> refers to a &#x201C;folder of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts&#x201D; 
                        rather than to a bound item, suggesting that the dealer may have removed the binding prior to the fire. Given his 
                        interest in the very early manuscripts in the collection, two of which he initially held back from <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>, 
                        perhaps <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> considered keeping those manuscripts for himself or dealing with them separately from the other manuscripts in his keeping. 
                        Of course, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> could not have retained two poems, and sent the others separately, unless he had already removed the binding, whether before or after the fire. 
                        Certainly, the items forming <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> were loose when delivered to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale University Library</orgName> as (or among) &#x201C;31 sheets of poems&#x201D;

                            It is unclear what <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s column of numbered  sheets  refers to, or why his enumeration omits 4, 21&#x2013;23, and 27, since the numbers cannot be reconciled with consistent features of the individual manuscripts. Nor can <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s numbers, even subtracting the skipped numbers, be reconciled with <title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby &#x0026; Co.</orgName>, Catalogue of Manuscripts and Library (<date when="1931">1931</date>)</title>, which describes <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> as containing &#x201C;24 pp&#x201D;. One possibility is that <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> was counting sheets on which items were mounted. For example, &#x201C;Come on good horse&#x201D; (part of <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>), mentioned in <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s letter to <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName>, is pasted onto a sheet with a watermark partially visible, &#x201C;[. . .]ETOWGOOD FINE&#x201D;, the same watermark found in the paper on which <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations: Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and Some of the Southern&#x201D;</title> is mounted (see Content, a; and Content, b). These papers cannot be proven to have belonged to <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> as originally bound, since <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s title and contents pages are written on quite different paper, watermarked &#x201C;Judicature Foolscap&#x201D;. However, this style of mounting is common in the older collections of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts, as in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title>, in which the early small poetry pamphlets are mounted onto larger sheets, which are in turn bound together. Further connecting the mounting sheets for <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations: Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and Some of the Southern&#x201D;</title> with the original <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, these papers show evidence of slight charring. It is reasonable to conclude, then, that <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s column of numbers refers to mounting sheets but possibly only for the smaller items; in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title>, for example, larger items were not mounted on sheets but attached directly to binding stubs.
                            Other possible discrepancies arise in comparing <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents with the contents of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> as listed in the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>. <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations: Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and Some of the Southern&#x201D;</title>, listed in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:530, is omitted from <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents, unless this item is comprised among very early MSS.  (see below, Content). <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table also fails to mention  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCRYSTALHUNTER">The Crystal Hunter</title>  (no. 188), mentioned in the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title> list, unless <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> meant to include this ode under the entry  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTOHISFATHER">To his father. Birthday ode</title> <date when="1834">1834</date>.  Otherwise, the two lists of contents match, the one in <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title> being ordered according to what <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> judged (partly erroneously) to be the items&#x02BC; dates.
                            Somewhat better success may attend comparison of the <date when="1943-01">January 1943</date> acquisition notice in YULG of 31 sheets of poems  with the numbers of sheets presently extant&#x2014;but only by stretching the definition of sheet.  Putting aside <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPAPWHATSTIME">Papa whats time</title>  and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRBOSWORTHFIELD">Bosworth Field</title>,  which <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> held back, and  <title type="drama" corresp="#JRASCENTSTBERNARD">Hospice</title>,  which he sent separately, thirty sheets can be counted, plus one sixteen&#x2010;page (or eight&#x2010;sheet) sewn booklet. If it is credible that a cataloger counted the booklet as one  sheet,  we can refer to at least one benchmark, that the present collection corresponds to what <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> originally sent, when considering the possibility of lost or destroyed items.
                            I think it more likely, however, that the YULG count of thirty&#x2010;one refers, not to physical sheets, but titles of poems&#x2014;i.e., the notice ought to have read  sheets of 31 poems.  One can arrive at that number by counting the individual titles in <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, <title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title>, for both <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> and <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSX">X</title>. <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSX">MS X</title> is recognizable in the YULG notice by the listing of one of its items, a <date when="1836-03-31">31 March 1836</date> verse letter to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> (see <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSX">MS X</title>,  Content,  e). If one discounts this item as listed separately, as well as the poems <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> held back from <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, one can imagine a cataloger at <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> using the <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> <title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title> cursorily to check the titles of pieces delivered to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>. This would still tell us that the present collection largely corresponds to what <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> sent, although it provides no certainty that portions of individual titles&#x2014;sheets of  <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>  and  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</title>,  items that can be only partially reconciled with the earlier descriptions&#x2014;may not have been lost or misplaced after, rather than before, the collection arrived at <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>.
                            At some point after acquiring <title type="manuscriipt" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> from <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> enclosed most of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>s original items in a folder labeled  <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">Early Poems IA</title>  but sorted a few other items probably from <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> into other, separate folders labeled  <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>  and  <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName>  (see  Content,  a and g, below; neither of these separate folders is listed in the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke</orgName>&#x02BC;s card catalog, unlike  <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">Early Poems IA</title>  and folders containing other items donated by <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>). All three folders are enclosed in a box labeled  <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin, John</persName>, <date notBefore="1819" notAfter="1900">1819&#x2013;1900</date> / Miscellaneous Manuscripts,  along with folders devoted to other manuscripts, which are unrelated to <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>.
                        Of these manuscripts in the box that are unrelated to <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, some were once included in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSX">MS X</title>, a volume that was split up like <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> and donated by <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> in <date when="1942">1942</date>: nos. 109, 203, 215, 256, and the  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPEACESONG">Peace Song</title>,  and the  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRZODIACSONG">Zodiac Song</title>  (see part 1, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSX">MS X</title>).

                    <p>
                        Possible discrepancies exist between the items as presently disposed in the folder <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> or elsewhere in the box  Miscellaneous Manuscripts  and their description in earlier accounts. The discrepancies, if they represent actual losses and not merely confusions arising from inadequate descriptions, might well be blamed on destruction by <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s fire; however, with the exception of one, rather slender piece of evidence (see [b] below), documentation is too scanty to confirm if, when, or how the losses occurred. If <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> disassembled <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> prior to the fire, it is even possible that he had already misplaced an item or two or sold them separately, their present whereabouts unknown.
                        a) In the folder <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">Early Poems IA</title>, draft for portion of <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>, no. 46, single torn sheet, 12 × 20 cm; 34 lines in ink beginning  come on good horse and let us see, from the third book of the poem, lines 26&#x2013;59, as fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> (with minor variants and deleted lines). On verso, 12 lines in very rough pencil draft of two passages from the third book of the poem as fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>:  martin took his task a[s(?)] guide / [(?)]d all the women did in him confide,  which are interesting variants of lines 86&#x2013;87 of fair copy; and, following a horizontal line, draft of lines 14&#x2013;25 of the fair copy. On the verso, portions of the pencil draft were lost with tears at the edges, which is not the case with the ink script on the other side, <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> writing around the tears. Thus, the ink copy must have been written after the pencil (the lines are sequential, except for lines 86&#x2013;87), and therefore, I believe, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was fair&#x2010;copying in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> as he drafted. This is one of several indications that <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>  draft, far from offering  the earliest example known of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s handwriting, was composed in <date when="1829">1829</date> like its fair copy.
                        This manuscript must have been the first item in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> when bound since <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> heads his table of contents  Very early MSS. &#x201C;Come on, good horse&#x201D; &#x0026;c.  <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title>.  also lists it as the first item (79.A.1) and quotes from the manuscript extensively. <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> describes the manuscript as consisting of  2 pp.,  and, if he means two sides of one sheet, then this item fully matches his description.
                        As already mentioned (Description, above) <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s sheet is mounted onto a slightly larger sheet watermarked [(?)]ETOWGOOD FINE, which I assume to have been cut from the bound <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>. The mounting sheet, but not the manuscript itself, shows slight evidence of charring.
                        The <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> box  Miscellaneous Manuscripts  holds another folder labeled <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>,  containing a 12.5 × 20&#x2013;cm sheet written in pencil, 34 lines in pencil from the second book of the poem as fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, lines 29&#x2013;63, beginning  now must we leave poor martin there  and continuing to bottom of its verso,  you are under my protection then I say goodbye.  These lines together with those on the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> sheet thus add up to the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>&#x02BC;s listing of  <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>  versified, 80 lines  in the original <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> (<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:530).
                        <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">The Library Edition</title> dates these 80 lines as <date when="1827">1827</date>, but the two manuscripts suggest no reason for dating their drafts from books II or III much earlier than their <date when="1829">1829</date> fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, since the manuscripts are similar in paper, size, and pencil handwriting. Moreover, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears not to have used longhand earlier than <date when="1828">1828</date> (see no. 21; see also no. 46 for further remarks on the dating of  <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title> ).
                        The pencil draft in the separate folder must have formed part of the second item in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> when bound, since <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title>. lists in second place (item 79.A.2, following the ink manuscript of  <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title> )  4 pp. in pencil [of] a metrical transcription from <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">Monastery</title>.  But if by  4 pp.  <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> means the rectos and versos of two sheets, and if his item 79.A.2 truly consisted entirely of  <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>,  then one sheet is presently missing.
                        <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> left other evidence that he knew of a another sheet. The pencil draft, like the ink draft in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA folder</title>, is mounted on a slightly larger, charred sheet (watermark showing only a seated <!--Tagged as place rather than the goddess--><placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">Brittania</placeName> in an oval surmounted by a crown). On this sheet, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> wrote below the manuscript,  This (with the previous pp.) is a rhymed version of passages from chapter II of <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title> (first edition), vol. 1, 182[(?)] / CEG 19[(?)]  (my emphasis; part of the note lost with trimmed, burnt edges of the mounting sheet). Since <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> apparently counted  pages  or rectos and versos of sheets, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s  pp.  might have referred only to the ink manuscript (<title type="poem" corresp="#JRGOODHORSE">come on good horse</title> ), which remains extant, and not to that manuscript plus another unknown one; but, if so, he would have erred in identifying both the ink manuscript and the pencil draft as versifying chapter two of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s novel, for the ink manuscript is taken from chapter three.
                        The problem is not clarified by comparing <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s records with <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s. <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents included with <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> lists three  sheets  of  Very early MSS.,  starting with  come on good horse&#x2014;this entry certainly referring to the first, ink manuscript of  <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>  but also to two other unnamed items, whether he means manuscript sheets (recto and verso) or sheets used to mount manuscripts. <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s other two items may have been <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s two sheets ( 4 pp. ) of pencil manuscript of  <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>,  again pointing to a presently missing second sheet. But, again, the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> specifies  80 lines,  which are presently accountable in two manuscripts. (<persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title> fails to mention the total number of lines in either his  2 pp.  or his  4 pp.  manuscripts, just as, annoyingly, the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> fails to mention the number of sheets.)
                        Thus, in summary, inconclusive evidence points to a missing sheet of  <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">Monastery</title>  draft&#x2014;<persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s third  sheet,  or <persName corresp="CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s two more  pages.  To identify that missing sheet, we might look to manuscript, not of  <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>,  but of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</title>, b below. This item, however, raises problems of its own.
                        b) Also in the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> folder labeled  <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>  is a 12.5 × 20&#x2010;cm folded sheet, written on all four sides in pencil, beginning Orpheus and bootes now.  This is partial draft of  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</title>,  no. 21, which survives in other copies. This manuscript is pasted onto a sheet that, like the mounting for the ink  <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">Monastery</title>  manuscript, is watermarked [(?)]ETOWGOOD FINE and is slightly charred.
                        The <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> mentions <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</title>  as having been bound in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> following <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title> (<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:530), and one might suspect that here is the third item in <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents as well as <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s additional  <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">Monastery</title>  manuscript, which he misidentified; and, indeed, this draft of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</title>  does physically resemble the pencil draft of <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>.  But this solution founders, since, first, the folded sheet comprises four  pages,  not <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s two; second, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> does separately itemize <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</title>  as following both the ink and the pencil <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">Monastery</title>  manuscripts (Cat., item 79.A.3). Compounding the mystery, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> describes a  6 pp.  manuscript, not a four&#x2010;page folded sheet, suggesting that a single sheet (i.e.,  2 pp. ) is presently missing from this poem, as well.
                        <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents included with <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> fails to list  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</title>  altogether, unless he included it among the three items of  Very Early MSS. ; that is, <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s  1&#x2013;3  may correspond to <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s item 79.A.1&#x2013;3 if <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> counted the ink manuscript of  <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>  as one item, the pencil manuscript as a second, and  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</title>  as a third. In both <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents and <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title>, these items are followed by <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPAPWHATSTIME">&#x201C;Papa whats time&#x201D;</title>.  But, as already explained, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s page count cannot be reconciled with the extant manuscripts. Moreover, why does <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents list  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPAPAWHATSTIME">Papa whats time</title>  as a fifth item, skipping over a fourth enumeration? Could <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s 1&#x2013;3  have referred only to the individual sheets of  <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>,  including the now missing sheet, while the skipped fourth item in his list was <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</title>? Owing to the sketchiness of <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s manner of describing the contents of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">
                        MS IA</title>, one returns to <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title> as the more accurate description when <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> was still bound, and this description clearly indicates a sheet of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</title>  that, like a sheet of the  <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>, cannot presently be accounted for.
                        In <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName>&#x02BC;s transcription of  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</title>  (from the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version) among her papers at the <orgName corresp="#MORGANLIBRARY">Morgan Library</orgName>, she points to the line  Orpheus and bootes new [sic]  and remarks,  Here begins version in <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> ms. ; that is, the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> version begins at line 27 of the complete poem as fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>&#x2014;and the manuscript does appear fragmentary&#x2014;and carries through to the end. <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName>&#x02BC;s gloss suggests that a sheet (perhaps containing draft of the opening 26 lines) may have been unavailable to her, as well as to us (HGVP, box F.X), which may tend to confirm that nothing has been lost or misplaced at least since <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> arrived at <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> (see  Description  above; <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName>&#x02BC;s transcription is undated, but she had been steadily transcribing <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> material since the late <date notBefore="1920" notAfter="1929">1920s</date> and probably examined the <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> collection not long after it came to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> in <date when="1942">1942</date>).
                        As discussed in the note to no. 21, <orgName corresp="#RUSKINLIBRARYLANCASTER">Lancaster</orgName> holds two photographs (one of the front and one of the back) of another manuscript of  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</title>  different from the extant <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> manuscript, a photograph that was made in the course of compiling the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>. The existence or location of the original of this manuscript is unknown, but it was clearly intermediate between the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> draft and the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair copy: it showed a printed fair copy of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> draft version, with longhand revisions that were carried into the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version. The lost intermediate fair copy tends to support the probable loss of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">Constellations</title>  material from <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, since the photograph shows  orpheus and bootes now  as line 27, proving that draft of the first 26 lines must once have existed.
                        Could the photograph show the lost <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">IA manuscript</title> itself? The photograph reveals what looks like a binding behind the perimeter of the manuscript. If this was the  red&#x2010;cloth, thin folio  of the early descriptions of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, the photograph must significantly have reduced its actual size (as compared, for example, with the paper for <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents, which is larger). Even if the photograph reduced the original, however, it still fails to resolve the mystery. Instead of the presumably missing two pages, or unfolded single sheet, of  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</title>,  the photograph shows a folded sheet (i.e., 4 pages, although the manuscript itself is unnumbered), with the poem fair&#x2010;copied on 1r&#x2010;v and revisions scrawled on 2r&#x2010;v. The sheet appears to have been laid open flat against some sort of backing and photographed, first, from the front (showing pp. 4 and 1) and, second, from the back (showing pp. 2 and 3). Photographed in this manner, front and back, the manuscript cannot have been bound permanently along its fold. If the manuscript had been bound, the photograph would show, first on the left, the back page of an unrelated manuscript, and then on the right, the first page of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</title>, followed by the inside spread of the poem. That this is not the case is proved by a revised line of the poem, which was begun on p. 3, being finished on p. 4, the page to the left of p. 1 in the photograph.
                        Of course, the folded sheet shown in the photograph could have been bound afterward in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>. In that case, in order for <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> to arrive at the six pages mentioned in his <title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title>, he would have to have counted, along with the four&#x2010;page draft extant in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, only the two pages of fair copy on the folded sheet in the photograph, ignoring the revisions on pp. 3&#x2013;4. This seems to me improbable, since, while <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> might have ignored blank pages (see, e.g., c below), he would not have discounted draft revision.
                        c) A copy of  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPAPAWHATSTIME">Papa whats time</title> a figure or a sense  (no. 4, as reprinted and described in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 150&#x2013;51) is a 12.5 × 20&#x2013;cm folded sheet. It is listed as following  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations</title> in <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>,<title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title>, item 79.A.4, and in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:530; and the title occurs following the first entry,  Very Early MSS.,  in <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents. <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> describes  2 pp. in pencil,  rather than the expected four pages, presumably because p. 1v is blank, and 2v holds only the superscription described in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 150 (headnote). The manuscript is undamaged by fire and lies loose in the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> folder  <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">Early Poems IA</title>.  
                        d) All descriptions (<persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, <title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title>, item 79.B; <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:530; <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents for <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>) place  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRBOSWORTHFIELD">Bosworth Field</title>  (no. 69) following c above. The 19 × 11.5&#x2013;cm fair copy is undamaged by fire and lies loose in the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> folder  <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">Early Poems IA</title>.  Like c above, the manuscript is a presentation copy, a folded sheet with ink fair copy on the facing inside spread. Both blank outer pages are used for addresses: on one, &#x201C;For my Papa / from <persName corresp="#JR">J. Ruskin</persName> / <date when="1830-01-01">1 January 1830</date> / Age 10¾ years&#x201D; ; on the other, &#x201C;For my Papa  and, in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hand,  Aged 10¾ years / <date when="1830-01-01">1 Jany 1830</date>&#x201D;. Accordingly, in their dated list for <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> (<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:530), Cook and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> correctly ascribe the poem to late <date when="1829">1829</date>&#x2014;that is, composition in late <date when="1829">1829</date> for <title type="poem" corresp="#JRNEWYEARS1827">New Year&#x02BC;s</title> presentation.
                        e) <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, <title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOG">Catalogue</title>, item 79.C, cites  Poems&#x2014;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRVESUVIUS">Vesuvius</title>, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTRAFALGAR">Trafalgar</title>, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEYEW">The Yew</title> and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRDEATH">Death</title>&#x2014;a similar MS. to the foregoing [i.e., <title type="poem" corresp="#BOSWORTHFIELD">Bosworth Field</title>,&#x02BC; d above]. 8 pp. &#x2018;For [sic] my Papa <date when="1830-02-08">February 8th 1830</date>.&#x2019;—&#x2018;by <persName corresp="#JR">J. Ruskin</persName> aged 11 years this day <date when="1830-02-08">8 Feby 1830</date>.&#x2019;  <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> has associated the four poems (8 pp. total) with a cover sheet for an unnamed presentation poem, inscribed &#x201C;by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>  To my Papa / <date when="1830-02-08">February 8th 1830</date>, and annotated by his father  by <persName corresp="#JR">J. Ruskin</persName> aged 11 years / this day / <date when="1830-02-08">8 Feby 1830</date>&#x201D;.  This cover sheet, like the four sheets (8 pp.) containing the poems, lies loose (and undamaged by fire) in the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> folder  <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">Early Poems IA</title>.  Almost certainly, only  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRVESUVIUS">Vesuvius</title>, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTRAFALGAR">Trafalgar</title>,  and  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEYEW">The Yew</title>  (nos. 70&#x2013;72) belong with the cover sheet, while  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRDEATH">Death</title>  (no. 73) should be separated from the group.
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRVESUVIUS">Vesuvius</title>,   <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTRAFALGAR">Trafalgar</title>,  and  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEYEW">The Yew</title>  are fair&#x2010;copied successively on both sides of three 20.5 × 12.5&#x2013;cm sheets identical to the cover sheet. When the folds and torn edges are matched up, the cover proves to have followed the last poem,  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEYEW">The Yew</title>,  with the address on the outside. This physical evidence is confirmed independently by the <date when="1830-02">February 1830</date> dates ascribed to  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRVESUVIUS">Vesuvius</title>  and  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTRAFALGAR">Trafalgar</title>,  nos. 70&#x2013;71, by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself in their <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> copies.
                        The fourth poem,  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRDEATH">Death</title>  (no. 73) probably does not belong to this group, since it is copied on a separate sheet of a slightly different size (19.75 × 12.5 cm), different watermark ( J WHA[(?)] / TURKE[(?)] / 18[(?)]  as compared to  HOLDSWORTH / &#x0026; / PHILLIPS used for the other three poems), and unmatching horizontal folds. This copy of  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRDEATH">Death</title>  should be dated, rather, by its <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> copy, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> assigned to <date when="1830-03">March 1830</date> It is true, however, that the lettering style for this presentation copy is very similar to that for the other three poems, as well as for  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRBOSWORTHFIELD">Bosworth Field</title>,  d above.
                        The early editors, as so often, contribute only obfuscation. In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:530, the editors group together  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRBOSWORTHFIELD">Bosworth Field</title>,   <title type="poem" corresp="#JRVESUVIUS">Vesuvius</title>,   <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTRAFALGAR">Trafalgar</title>,  and  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEYEW">The Yew</title>  under <date when="1829">1829</date>, and they assign  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRDEATH">Death</title>  alone to <date when="1830">1830</date>, apparently pairing  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRDEATH">Death</title>  with the cover sheet. This would be the least probable grouping. The <date when="1830-01-01">1 January 1830</date> (composed <date when="1829">1829</date>)  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRBOSWORTHFIELD">Bosworth Field</title>  manuscript has nothing to do, physically, with the other manuscripts, and the other poems are independently ascribable to <date when="1830">1830</date>, not <date when="1829">1829</date>.
                        <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents for <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> does properly distinguish between  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRBOSWORTHFIELD">Bosworth Field</title>,   <title type="poem" corresp="#JRDEATH">Death</title>,  and the trio  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRVESUVIUS">Vesuvius</title>,   <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTRAFALGAR">Trafalgar</title>,  and  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEYEW">The Yew</title>  as three separate items. His sketchy description does not mention the <date when="1830-08-02">8 February 1830</date> cover sheet, much less whether it might still have been physically attached to the trio of poems at this time. It is possible, however, that his cryptic  7&#x2013;10  for  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRVESIVIUS">Vesuvius</title>,   <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTRAFALGAR">Trafalgar</title>,  and  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEYEW">The Yew</title>  included the cover sheet to make a total of four  sheets.  
                        f) All descriptions (<persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>,<title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title>, item 79.D; <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:530; <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents for <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>) list  My Father&#x02BC;s Birthday  for <date when="1833">1833</date> ( <date when="1833-05">The month of May</date>, <date when="1833-05">the month of May</date>,  no. 178), which is in the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> folder  <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">Early Poems IA</title>.  <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> describes the manuscript as  1½ pp., 4to &#x2014;i.e., two 20 × 25&#x2010;cm sheets, one of them taken up by the poem on its recto and its verso, and the other devoted only to the address  To my Father / <date when="1833-05-10">10th May 183</date>. The sheets, burned on the left and right edges, are enclosed in plastic.
                        <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> ascribes his printing of the poem (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>,  277&#x2013;78) to RMS I (i.e., <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title>), but I have been unable to locate a copy of the poem either in that volume&#x02BC;s table of contents or in the volume itself. I would assume, therefore, that <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> has confused <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title> with <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, except that his printing shows a few slight variants from the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> copy. These may be errors or carry&#x2010;overs from the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> printing.
                        g) The parts of <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</title>, no. 180, as they were described in earlier accounts of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, all appear to be extant, either in the folder  <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">Early Poems IA</title>  or elsewhere in the box  Miscellaneous Manuscripts.  In the folder  IA  are two sheets (20.2 × 25.2 cm) containing copies (perhaps draft or semifinal copy) of the first five poems (without their prose sections) of no. 180, in the order those poems appear in the fair copy, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> numbered the lines of these poems sequentially&#x2014;that is, without starting his numbering anew with each poem&#x2014;showing that he had established their order for the fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>. The first of these two sheets contains the following:
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">Calais</title>  (poem only, lines numbered by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 1&#x2013;24, complete as fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>; copy in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hand).
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCASSEL">Cassel</title>  (poem only, untitled in manuscript, lines numbered by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 25&#x2013;51, i.e., lines 1&#x2013;27 as fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>; copy in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hand from line 25 to 42, and in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand from line 43 to 51 [i.e., <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand starts with the ecclesiastical procession,  While far beneath in long array,  etc.).
                        A key for a code, nearly every letter of the alphabet represented by a code symbol (not employed in any known manuscript; see no. 99), at bottom of recto and in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand.
                        As noted, this sheet is largely in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hand. It must therefore be <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, <title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title>, item 79.E,  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">Calais</title>. (MS., 2 pp., 4to, in the hand of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s father),  although the dealer is incorrect to ascribe the copy to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> entirely. By  4to,  <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> means the large size of the sheet. Although only slightly darkened by fire on one edge, the sheet is enclosed in plastic.
                        The second sheet of this manuscript resumes  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCASSEL">Cassel</title>  and includes three more poems:
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCASSEL">Cassel</title>  (poem only, lines numbered by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 52&#x2013;62, i.e., lines 28&#x2013;38 as fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>).
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRLILLE">Lille</title>  (poem only, lines numbered by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 63&#x2013;112, i.e., complete as fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>).
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRBRUSSELS">Brussels</title>  (poem only, lines numbered by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 113&#x2013;73, i.e., complete as fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>).
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMEUSE">The Meuse</title>  (poem only, written sideways in the margin, front side of the sheet, i.e., the side with  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCASSEL">Cassel</title>  and part of  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRLILLE">Lille</title> ; complete as fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>).
                        This second sheet is entirely in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand. It must be <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>,<title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title>, item 79.G, from which he quotes eight lines of the poem  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRLILLE">Lille</title>,  and which he describes identically to item 79.E above as  2 pp., 4to.  This sheet is more seriously damaged than its mate and is enclosed in plastic.
                        This second sheet is what <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> lists as <title type="poem" corresp="#JRLILLE">Lille</title>, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMEUSE">The Meuse</title> in his table of contents, while the first sheet must be represented by one of the items in the entry  <title type="composite" corresp="#JRCALAISCOMP">Calais</title> (2 items).  As I remarked above ( Description ), however, the penciled gloss  (2 items)  appears to be <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s.
                        In a separate folder in the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> box and labeled  <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName>,  more material from no. 180 is fair&#x2010;copied on a folded sheet, 12.6 × 20.2 cm. This is <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, <title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title>., item 79.F ( Prose and verse&#x2014;<title type="composite" corresp="#JRCALAISCOMP">Calais</title>, <title type="composite" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSCOMP">Passing the Alps</title>, <title type="composite" corresp="#JRMILANCOMP">Milan Cathedral</title>, <title type="composite" corresp="#JRANDERNACHTCOMP">Andernacht</title> and <title type="composite" corresp="#JRSTGOARCOMP">St. Goar</title>&#x2014;4 pp. ), and presumably the second of the  (2 items),  according to the notation next to <title type="composite" corresp="#JRCALAISCOMP">Calais</title>  in <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents. (<persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s description <title type="composite" corresp="#JRCALAISCOMP">Calais</title> could fit either of the two sheets starting with <title type="composite" corresp="#JRCALAISCOMP">Calais</title>, prose or verse, with the  &#x0026;c.  standing for the other poems on the respective sheets. His ascription of the single digit  13  to the item(s) is as obscure as his other enumerations.) This small folded sheet escaped fire damage, as did other manuscripts of its size in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">IA</title>.
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> numbered lines of poetry on this manuscript, as well. It consists of the following:
                        <title type="essay" corresp="#JRCALAISPROSE">Calais</title>  (prose only, complete as fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>).
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">Passing the Alps</title>  (poem; lines numbered by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 324&#x2013;59; a unique copy of this poem, neither fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> nor drafted in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>).
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRMILANCATHEDRAL">Milan Cathedral</title>  (poem; lines numbered by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 360&#x2013;77; a unique copy, neither fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> nor drafted in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>).
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRANDERNACHT">Andernacht</title>  (poem; lines numbered by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 378&#x2013;403; complete as fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> and printed <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, Works, 2:354 n.—i.e., not the main copytext used for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:353&#x2013;54, which is from a later revision of  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRANDERNACHT">Andernacht</title>).

                        This copy of selected prose and verse&#x2014;like the two sheets containing the poems  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">Calais</title>, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCASSEL">Cassel</title>, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRLILLE">Lille</title>, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRBRUSSELSPOEM">Brussels</title>, and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMEUSE">The Meuse</title> &#x2014;probably dates from relatively early in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s project, no. 180, since  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRANDERNACHT">Andernacht</title>  and  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSTGOAR">St. Goar</title>  were later revised, perhaps sometime in <date when="1835">1835</date>, for publication in <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</title> (see note to no. 180).

Birthday ode</title> <date when="1834">1834</date>  since, in the presentation copy itself,  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCRYSTALHUNTER">The Crystal Hunter</title>  begins on the verso of the prefatory address  My Dearest Father.  (In <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, however, no. 192 is headed differently as  The Address  and drafted separately from no. 188.)
                        <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> cites  3 pp.  for this manuscript, an error that seems unaccountable except as a confusion with j below, which is fair&#x2010;copied on the same size paper. The <date when="1834">1834</date> poem is fair&#x2010;copied on four 25 × 20&#x2010;cm sheets (i.e., 8 pp.), badly charred on the top and bottom edges and sealed in plastic, and contained in the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> folder  <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">Early Poems IA</title>.  The sheets are written on seven sides and numbered 1&#x2013;7 by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, with the final page left blank except for  To my Father.  On p. 7, there is a notation, almost obliterated by the burnt edge,  [Johns(?)] poetry / <date when="1834-05">May 1834</date>. 
                        This birthday poem marks a departure from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s earlier method of fashioning presentation copies, which was to fold a single sheet sideways to form a small (approximately 12 × 20&#x2010;cm) pamphlet. Here, two columns of text are written on a full sheet broadside, and two more on the verso broadside. The text on the verso is written upside&#x2010;down to the text on the front, so that, when the sheet is flipped over, the text still appears right&#x2010;side&#x2010;up. These more spacious presentations become the rule after the mid&#x2010;1830s.
                        i)  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTWELVEMONTHSALLROLLINGROUND">Twelve months all rolling round have past</title>,  no. 164, is listed in all descriptions: <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents for <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>; <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>,<title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title>, item 79.I (as  another birthday poem to his father, 4 pp., undated ); and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:530. The poem is untitled and undated but listed as <date when="1831">1831</date> in the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>. Like other items of its size in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, it was unaffected by fire.
                        When this manuscript is compared against <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s ode for his father&#x02BC;s birthday of <date when="1831">1831</date>, bound in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title> (see  Content,  g), the two manuscripts can be seen to match in every particular: they are both 20 × 12.3&#x2010;cm folded sheets of light blue&#x2010;green paper, display the same  copperplate  hand (<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s fancy scripts can vary, but the capital letters in these two manuscripts are clearly imitated from the same source), and even match up in their horizontal folds.
                        Obviously, when the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title> manuscript declares at the bottom of 1v that  I here do beg to give you an ensample,  the reader is meant to look for the  ensample  at the top of the folded insert&#x2014;i.e., what is now the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> manuscript&#x2014;which begins <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTWELVEMONTHSALLROLLINGROUND">Twelve months all rolling round have past</title>.  In his printing of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title> ode, <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> breaks off with  I here do beg to give you an ensample  but remarks in a note that the draft in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> extends beyond this line, adding  fifty&#x2010;four lines to illustrate both the comic and &#x2018;flowery&#x2019; styles of poetry  and that these additional lines begin  Twelve months all rolling round have past  (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 256). The fair copy of those lines (albeit with revisions from the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VIII</title> version) became separated from the fair copy of the poem&#x02BC;s opening.
                        For the relation between <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s birthday odes to his father for <date when="1831">1831</date> and <date when="1832">1832</date>, and for prior confusion over dating of these odes, see nos. 118a and 164.

The text is written on three sides of two 20 × 25&#x2010;cm sheets, with the fourth given to the address  To my Father / <date when="1836-05-10">May 10th 1836</date>  Like h above and unlike birthday presentation poems of earlier years,  Congratu&#x2014;  is written out using the full sides of sheets, not half&#x2010;pages pamphlet style&#x2014;only here, the text is written top to bottom, not broadside as in h. With their left and right edges charred, the sheets are enclosed in plastic and contained in the folder  <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">Early Poems IA</title>. 
                        k) All descriptions (<persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>,<title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title>, item 79.K; <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:530; <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents for <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>) list  <title type="composite" corresp="#JRMONTBLANCCOMP">Mont Blanc</title>.  This 19.7 × 13.2&#x2010;cm sheet, written on both sides, is correctly noted in all accounts as a transcription in <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand. Although the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> declares this  the only complete copy  (<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:468), the manuscript can only be deemed longer than the <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSVII">MS VII</title> version, not necessarily complete, since the writing extends top to bottom on both sides of this torn half&#x2010;sheet. For speculation about the poem&#x02BC;s dating, see  Undatable Pieces,  B. The manuscript is not damaged by fire and lies in the folder  <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">Early Poems IA</title>.

None of the descriptions mentions the handwriting, however, which appears to be <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s. The title and one correction are in pencil (possibly <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own hand), the stanzas in ink (<persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s hand?). The copy contains only seven unnumbered stanzas of this much longer, although unfinished, poem; but, since the manuscript is written on only three sides, it may represent all that had been composed at the time of its transcription. If so, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> (<title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title>, item 79.L) and <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> (<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:530) are correct to attribute this manuscript to <date when="1831">1831</date>, while the entire poem should be dated <date notBefore="1831" notAfter="1832">1831&#x2013;32</date>, as Cook and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> correctly note (<persName corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:537).

                        m) All descriptions (<persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>,<title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title>, item 79.M; <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:530; <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents for <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>) list  <title type="drama" corresp="#JRASCENTSTBERNARD">A Visit to the Hospice of St. Bernard</title>  (no. 209). The manuscript consists of 12 sheets, 19.5 × 25 cm, watermarked <date when="1834">1834</date>, with the pages numbered 1&#x2013;24 by a hand other than <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s. The text is neatly disposed on hand&#x2010;ruled lines. This fair copy, as the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> remarks,  goes no further than the opening of Scene 5  (<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 1:505 n. 1); specifically, p. 24 ends with the phrase &#x201C;torrent of the Drance, whose dark waters have worn.&#x201D;  Since this phrase extends to the bottom right corner, further fair copy could have existed, although the extant draft in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> continues only through some portion of scene 6. The sheets of the fair copy are charred on the left and right edges, and encased in plastic. The ink is badly faded, especially from p. 8 to the end. The sheets are contained in the folder  <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">Early Poems IA</title>. 
                                n) All descriptions (<persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>,<title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title>, item 79.N; <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:530; <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents for <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>) list <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSCYTHIANBANQUET">A Scythian Banquet Song</title>  (no. 259). <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s description of  4 pp.  must be revised to take account of fire damage. Of the  4 pp. —or two 19.5 × 25&#x2010;cm sheets (one watermarked <date when="1837">1837</date>) written on both sides, now in the folder  <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">Early Poems IA</title> —one sheet has been separated at its fold into two 19.5 × 12.5&#x2010;cm sheets, so that the manuscript is now encased in a total of three plastic sleeves. The manuscript suffered especially intrusive charring, costing some lines at the top and bottom of the sheets, which have been trimmed in places.
                        The manuscript holds only the first 16 stanzas of the 27&#x2010;stanza poem, presented in the manner of h above—the stanzas written in two columns broadside and continued in the same style on the verso. All four sides of the original sheets are filled, suggesting that this fair copy could have once continued onto further sheets, but <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s  4 pp.  indicates that only these two sheets were included in the bound <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>. <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>, in his table of contents, enumerates the manuscript as  24.25.,  as if it consisted of two sheets, but his meaning is obscure, since he does not so designate other manuscripts consisting of multiple sheets. The <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> fails to clarify whether the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> copy, as the editors knew it, was complete (<persName corresp="JRWORKSLE">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:57 n.).
                        The manuscript is early enough to record a change in title, #FN01# <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSCYTHIANBANQUET">A Scythian Banquet</title> #FN02# Song, and the headnote differs from the published version:  The taste of the Scythians #FN03# in household furniture if we may trust to Herodotus was somewhat peculiar: their drinking cups for instance, being generally the skulls of their enemies  (<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:57). A few minor changes in wording #FN04# in the final lines of stanzas 1 and 7, respectively) are accounted for in the published text. Otherwise, the manuscript is neatly written, perhaps too neat to be the original draft that,  as appears from letters to <persName corresp="#WHH">W. H. Harrison</persName>,  was composed  in a single day, before <date when="1838-03">March 1838</date>  (<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:57 n. 1). Note that, in another letter to <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> of <date when="1838-08-01">1 August 1838</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> still entitles the poem a  Drinking Song  (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:69), so the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> copy&#x2014;or at least the revisions on this copy&#x2014;may date from after that time.
                        o) All descriptions (<persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>,<title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title>, item 79.O; <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:530; <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents for <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>) list  <title type="poem" corresp="#JRBROKENCHAIN">The Broken Chain</title>,  no. 245a.

This fair copy, which is in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hand, contains only stanzas 17&#x2013;26 of part V; however, nothing has been lost from <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, since <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents specifies  Stanzas 17.26, and both <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title> (2:530) and <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>,<title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title>, concur. The manuscript is undamaged by fire and lies loose in the folder  <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">Early Poems IA</title>. 
                        p) The <date when="1832">1832</date> prose translation of the <title type="poem" corresp="#JRILIAD">Iliad</title>, misdated as <date when="1842">1842</date> by <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> (<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:530; see no. 160a), is contained in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> folder. This is a fair copy on six 31.5 × 19&#x2010;&#x2013;cm sheets; each sheet was folded once vertically, so the sheets could be assembled as a quire, forming a booklet with 16 × 19&#x2013;cm pages, each page holding two vertical columns of text. The paper is hand&#x2010;ruled and the text obsessively neat, resembling (except in its double&#x2010;column format) the Sermon Books, MSS IIA&#x2010;E.
                        In its present condition, the quire has been separated into individual sheets, each sheet laid flat and enclosed in clear plastic, owing to fire damage. Thus, each sheet consists of four pages. Since neither the pages nor the sheets are numbered, the following list conjecturally orders them. 
                    
                        The pages are identified by their first and last words:
                        Sheet 1 (p. 1,  Now tell  through  Argos far ; p. 2,  from her  through  hecatombs un ; pp. 23&#x2013;24, blank).
                        Sheet 2 (p. 3,  paid  through  dark ; p. 4,  eyed  through  me that ; pp. 21&#x2013;22, blank).
                        Sheet 3 (p. 5,  the value  through  much more ; p. 6,  than thee  through  the dark&#x2013; ; pp. 19&#x2013;20, blank).
                        Sheet 4 (p. 7,  eyed  through  orator of ; p. 8,  whom  through  not me ; p. 17,  ed words  through  of ten  [end of fair copy, column left incomplete, with  127  (i.e., line 129) in pencil and in <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s hand added at end]; p. 18, blank).
                        Sheet 5 (p. 9,  and I will  through  left to me ; p. 10,  to turn  through  Greeks took ; p. 15,  the Greeks  through  and spoke ; p. 16,  Hear me  through  with wing ).
                        Sheet 6 (p. 11,  to <persName type="fictional_person" corresp="#CHRYSES">Chryses</persName>  through  with the ; p. 12,  hecatomb  through  ascen&#x2013; ; p. 13,  ded soon  through  of the Greeks ; p. 14,  Then answered  through  ships of ).
                        None of the manuscript is missing, since <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:50 specify the translation as extending only to book 2, line 127. <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> (<title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCATALOGUE">Catalogue</title>, item 79.P) describes  16 pp., double column,  an odd way of counting since he includes only the full double&#x2010;column pages, omitting p. 17 with its single incomplete column.
                        
                        Footnotes:

                    <head type="section">Date</head>
                    <p>	The dates of the contents of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> range from <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1842">1827 or 1828 to 1842</date>.
                        As a bound collection, the compiling and binding of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> must have been nearly contemporaneous with the preparation of the first two volumes of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>. 
                        <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s remarks about the binding on the title page of the manuscript itself (&#x201C;bound since the publication of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891">Poems</title> in <date when="1891">1891</date> / and may be added to the list of MS. given there, as IA&#x201D;) 
                        is very like the editors&#x02BC; comment in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:530 (&#x201C;this volume has been bound up since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s death, and is thus an addition to the list in the <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891">Poems</title>, <date when="1891">1891</date>&#x201D;), 
                        suggesting that the collection was compiled shortly prior to publication of volume 2 (<date when="1903">1903</date>) of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>. The fact that <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s table of contents for the manuscript is somewhat confused 
                        (see Description) further argues for the manuscript&#x02BC;s compilation during the hectic lead&#x2010;up to initial publication of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> (see ???).</p>
                </div>
                <div type="section" xml:id="DISCUSSION">
                    <head type="section">Discussion</head>
                    <!--The Discussion section may contain all or only some of the following subsections.-->
                    <div type="subsection">
                        <head type="subsection">Hand</head>
                        <p>A common tie linking these individual manuscripts is that the works are all poems, except for a single prose piece, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#JRILIAD">Translation of <persName corresp="#HOMER">Homer</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#ILIAD">Iliad</title></title>, 
                            and even that item could reasonably have been classified as a poem for purposes of inclusion here. 
                            Also, these poetry manuscripts were gathered and bound following publication of <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891">Poems</title> (<date when="1891">1891</date>), 
                            possibly because its editor, <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName>, had overlooked the manuscripts altogether or had consulted without identifying them 
                            in his <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems"</title> (see Title). 
                            Given his thorough care in other respects, it seems likely that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> was unacquainted with these manuscripts, 
                            and that they must have surfaced after <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s death, in the course of the literary executors&#x02BC; search of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s study.
                        </p>
                        <p><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> did contain works published by <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>, but he drew on other manuscript versions of those works, 
                            without acknowledging the versions that came to be bound in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>. For example, in his introduction to <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891">Poems</title> (<date when="1891">1891</date>), 
                            <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> quotes <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTIMEBLANKVERSE">&#x201C;Time: Blank Verse&#x201D;</title> in its entirety without identifying the source, but variants in the title and line 22 
                            definitely point to <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> as his copytext. Nor were the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> manuscripts included among those in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title>, 
                            which <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> describes in <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D;</title> as consisting of 
                            &#x201C;an envelope containing loose papers, including poems; fair&#x2010;copied by the author as presents, chiefly to his father; or copied by others&#x201D; 
                            (<title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS4D1891">Poems</title> [4o, <date when="1891">1891</date>], 1:266; <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS8D1891">Poems</title> (8o, <date when="1891">1891</date>), 1:268). 
                            While some of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> manuscripts are inscribed as fair copies made for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s father, 
                            including <title type="poem" corresp="#JRBOSWORTHFIELD">&#x201C;Bosworth Field&#x201D;</title>; probably the trio <title type="poem" corresp="#JRVESUVIUS">&#x201C;Vesuvius&#x201D;</title>, &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#TRAFALGAR">Trafalgar</title>&#x201D;, and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEYEW">&#x201C;The Yew&#x201D;</title> (see Contents, e); and the birthday odes. 
                            One possibility is that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> had simply overlooked these items among the papers at <placeName corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName> when researching his edition. 
                            Meanwhile, in <date when="1889">1889</date>, even prior to the publication of <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891">Poems</title> (<date when="1891">1891</date>), 
                            <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title> had been bound&#x2014;despite <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</persName> description of it as an &#x201C;envelope&#x201D;&#x2014;and the items accidentally omitted were in due course gathered up to form <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>. 
                            (Years later, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title> was rebound to take account of still other omissions; see <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title>: Date; and <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title>: Description).
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another possibility is that the miscellany in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> is not accidental, but reflects some matter of provenance, now unrecoverable. 
                            The seemingly appropriate gathering for these items, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title>, was a gift by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to <persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName>; 
                            and <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</persName> description of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title> in his <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note&#x201D;,</title> which fails to take account of a binding added since he wrote the note, 
                            may indicate, not a failure to revise, but limited access. Other language might be construed as a euphemism for the fact that he knew only what <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> chose to tell him about <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title>: 
                            its contents, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> added, &#x201C;are useful as fixing dates in some cases; e.g., the <title type="poem" corresp="#JRNEWYEARS1827">New Year&#x02BC;s Address</title>, <date when="1827">1827</date>; and as supplying corrections or additions in other instances&#x201D; 
                            (<title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS4D1891">Poems</title> [4o, <date when="1891">1891</date>], 1:266; <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS8D1891">Poems</title> [8o, <date when="1891">1891</date>], 1:268). (<title type="poem" corresp="#JRNEWYEARS1827">The &#x201D;New Year&#x02BC;s Address</title>, <date when="1827">1827</date>&#x201D;, is <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESUN">&#x201C;The Sun&#x201D;</title> which is dated in its <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title> version, and not in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, which <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> 
                            may have used for copy&#x2010;text.) Similarly, was there some tension concerning ownership and use of the items in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, items that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> appears not to have consulted at all, 
                            and that by their nature belonged in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title>, a collection to which he may have allowed only limited access? The suggestion is entirely speculative. It is noteworthy, however, that in the closing paragraph of the 
                            &#x201C;<title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">Preliminary Note</title>&#x201D;, which immediately follows the discussion of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title>, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> somewhat unnecessarily refers to the &#x201C;excessively rare&#x201D; <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1850">Poems</title> (<date when="1850">1850</date>) along with mention of <persName corresp="#TJW">T. J. Wise</persName>. 
                            It is a reminder that of the atmosphere of the <date notBefore="1890" notAfter="1899">1890s</date>, rife with jealousies and acquisitiveness of book collectors.</p>
