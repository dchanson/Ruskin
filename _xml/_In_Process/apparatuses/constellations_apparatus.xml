                    <p>In the earlier of two surviving fair copies of the poem (see <ref type="internal" target="#MAJORMS">Manuscripts</ref>), 
                        <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> centered

                        Then, in what appears an afterthought, he added &#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">NORTHERN</hi>&#x0201D; to the right in the margin, on the baseline of the main title; 
                        and on a second line below &#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">NORTHERN</hi>&#x0201D;, placed awkwardly in the margin to the right of the opening lines of the poem, 
                        he added &#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">SOME OF THE ZODIAC / AND SOME OF THE SOUTHERN</hi>&#x0201D;. 
                        The added, trailing subtitle suggests that he extended the title as he expanded the poem, perhaps revealing one reason why he gave up 
                        on this fair copy, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title>, revised some of its lines on the same copy (see <ref type="internal" corresp="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>), 
                        and made a new fair copy incorporating these changes.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> incorporated his revisions to the first fair copy, including 
                        allowing space to center the subtitle properly below the main title and above the first line, breaking the three lines as

                        citing <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title></ref> and

                        They do not mention the manuscript that they apparently knew at some point in time from the photograph, 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT70"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title></ref>, which is presently catalogued among transcripts made for the

                        The editors&#x02BC; dating, judging by their only other mention of the poem, was based on an association of its fragment of rough draft 
                        with another fragment rough draft, similar in appearance, of <ref type="apparatus" target="monastery_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title></ref> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 2:260 n. 1). 
                        They bound both fragments in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>.</p>
                    
                    <p>There is no question that the earliest surviving manuscript is the <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title></ref> draft, 
                        which was the basis for the fair copy photographed as <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT70"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title></ref>, which in turn was the basis for the 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref> fair copy 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>). 
                        Internal evidence suggests that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have based the first lines of the poem 
                        on actual observation of the sky. The alignment of planets and constellations described at the beginning of the poem 
                        would have been observable in <date notBefore="1828-04" notAfter="1828-05">April&#x2013;May 1828</date>, 
                        <!--more in keeping with the occasion of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s birthday-->but not at all in <date when="1827">1827</date> 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</ref>). Physical evidence of both fair&#x2010;copy manuscripts, 
                        moreover, strongly suggests a date in <date when="1827">1828</date>. The question is whether composition of the draft could have begun in 
                        <date when="1827">1827</date>.</p>
                        
                    <p>None of the three manuscripts is dated in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand. Of the three, 
                        the fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> can most convincingly be dated <date when="1827">1828</date>. 
                        Its placement in the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK">Red Book</title></ref> 
                        following <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL2">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2&#x201D;</title></ref>

                        indicates some point of time after <date when="1828-01-01">1 January 1828</date> for this copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title>. 
                        By placing the poem first in the <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_poetry_anthology_2_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#MSIIIPOETRYANTHOLOGY2">MS III Second Poetry Anthology</title></ref>, 
                        immediately following <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL2">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears to emphasize a thematic association between the poem and the prose tale, 
                        in which <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> gives <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> 
                        a drawing of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name> &#x201C;as an introduction to astronomy&#x201D;. 
                        It is unknown, however, how much time lapsed between fair&#x2010;copying of <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL2">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title> and compilation of the poetry anthology, 
                        so the the poem's placement in the latter, prior to the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="new_years_poems_note.php">New Year&#x02BC;s poem</ref> <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESUN">&#x201C;The Sun&#x201D;</title>, does not necessarily argue for composition in the preceding year, <date when="1827">1827</date>.<!-- 
                        Thus, <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>, the editors of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title></ref>, 
                        may have been correct in listing the poem under <date when="1827">1827</date>. More precisely, however, 
                        composition would have occurred in late <date when="1827">1827</date>, although probably not as a <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="new_years_poems_note.php">New Year&#x02BC;s poem</ref>.--></p>
                    
                    <p>A factor that would confine a parameter for composition to the <date notBefore="1828-01-01" notAfter="1828-04-30">first quarter of 1828</date> 
                        is the possibility that certain details were dependent on actual observation of the sky 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#REAL-LIFE">Discussion: Observations Actual and Poetic</ref>). 
                        Those details occur in the opening lines of the poem as fair&#x2010;copied; and since those lines are missing from the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> draft, 
                        the possible real&#x2010;life factor cannot be applied. Therefore, an earlier genesis of the poem cannot be ruled out, with initial composition of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> draft commencing sometime in <date notBefore="1827-06" notAfter="1827-12">the second half of 1827</date>, 
                        and the first fair copy, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title>, being produced in winter leading up to <date when="1828-01-01">New Year&#x02BC;s 1828</date>. 
                        In that scenario, the first fair copy succumbed to revision, and the second fair copy was inscribed into <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, 
                        perhaps sometime in <date notBefore="1828-01" notAfter="1828-04">the first quarter of 1828</date>.</p>

                        but the editors&#x02BC; grounds for associating this draft with the draft of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> also contained therein can perhaps 
                        be neither confirmed nor denied, since The evidence in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> does hold open a possibility for an earlier date. 
                        As noted in nos. 1 and 4, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> seems habitually to have included his previous year&#x02BC;s presentation poems

                        Thus, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> could have existed as a New Year&#x02BC;s gift for <date when="1827">1827</date>,

                        It is possible that the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> draft manuscripts only seem to bear witness to a maturing process of revision because they happen to have been preserved, 
                        whereas draft manuscript of earlier works may have been discarded or existed in a more ephemeral form such as slate writing.

                        The <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title> manuscript is even unique in exhibiting a fair copy that was sacrificed to revision on the same document.</p>

                        <p>The item of draft in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> is a fragment, in a penciled cursive hand, 
                            starting at line 27 and extending to line 64 of the poem as completed in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair&#x2014;copy version. 
                            The draft text includes deletions in the form of strikethroughs, and substitutions above or following the deletions, using both pen and pencil for the changes.
                            The manuscript clearly is missing its original opening lines, beginning as it does at the top of 1r in mid&#x2014;career of the poem, lacking title or context. 
                            (It is possible that the missing piece of the draft manuscript of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;Constellations&#x201D;</title> did once exist as originally bound; 
                            see <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php#CONTENTS"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>: Contents, <hi rend="italic">b</hi></ref>).
                            The draft also lacks lines found at the ends of the two fair copies. Unlike the missing opening lines, however, 
                            the final lines, which fall on 2r of the manuscript, evidently served as the original conclusion, 
                            since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> noted (in ink, and using a smaller script) &#x201C;I end end&#x201D; below and to the left of the final line. In <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title>, 
                            the poem continues beyond the final lines as drafted for another nine lines, and in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> for another fourteen lines.</p>

                        <p>The appearance of this manuscript is strikingly similar&#x2014;in its sprawling pencil cursive and its smaller ink cursive hands, as well as in its paper and size of the physical document&#x2014;to 
                            an item of draft of <ref type="apparatus" target="monastery_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title></ref>, which begins

                            as those lines are fair&#x2014;copied and numbered in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>. 
                            This leaf of draft likewise was bound in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>. 
                            As remarked in the compositional history of <ref type="apparatus" target="monastery_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title></ref>, the episode of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s plot narrated in this passage 
                        describes how the Englishman, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#STAWARTHBOLTON">Captain Stawarth Bolton</persName>,<!--&#x02bc;s visit to the <placeName type="fictional" corresp="#TOWEROFGLENDEARG">Tower of Glendearg</placeName>, in which he-->

                        and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HALBERTGLENDINNING">Halbert</persName>, the elder. Because this stage of draft and fair copy are ascribed (based on physical evidence) to <date when="1828">1828</date>, 
                        it can be argued that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s selection of this episode 
                        reflects a preoccupation with the permanent adoption of his cousin,

                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> perhaps cemented composition of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> onto this family drama, which underlay composition of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>.

                            Thus, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> situates the avatar of his cousin in his paper world of text.

                            which he had learned to use recently, in <date when="1827-04">April 1827</date>, whereas he adopted a comparatively miniscule print&#x2014;lettering, more like a serif book type for the <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;Monastery&#x201D;</title>, 1&#x2013;2, and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;Constellations&#x201D;</title>, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title>. 
                            Moreover, in the earlier <date when="1827">1827</date> works, he almost entirely avoided punctuation, whereas punctuation does characterize the fair copies of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;Constellations&#x201D;</title>, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title>, and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;Monastery&#x201D;</title>, 1&#x2013;2;

                            and the marks are used only at the ends of lines. This obsessive observance abruptly ceases at book 2, line 80, at the top of page 79. 
                            Just so, the end of every line of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title> <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;Constellations&#x201D;</title> is notched with a punctuation mark until line 20, 
                            where the practice abruptly stops. Where used, the punctuation marks often seem arbitrary: while the full&#x2014;stop periods usually make grammatical sense, 
                            the commas, colons, and (in <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>) an upside&#x2014;down semicolon seem interchangeable. 
                            It appears, therefore, that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> layered over these texts 
                            with bookish punctuation to give the appearance of print, without entirely understanding the function of various marks&#x2014;until he tired of the process and stopped altogether at an arbitrary place. 
                            A final bookish touch in both manuscripts is to number the lines by fives in the left margin.</p>

                            the punctuation ending each line until it doesn&#x02BC;t, and the line numbering on the left. Thus, these ambitious (and inevitably incomplete) projects&#x2014;a versified novel,

                            This was the year of the Ruskins&#x02BC; aborted spring <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1828_note.php">Tour of <date when="1828">1828</date></ref>, which was cut short by the death of

                            and followed by a period of mourning, and the resettlement of her children, including the adoption

                 here       <p>More speculatively, one might order the three works chronologically according to skill. 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#JREUSODIA">&#x201C;Eudosia&#x201D;</title> is perhaps the earliest, since it frequently exhibits a bizarre mark made of two dots, like a colon on its side or a two&#x2014;point ellipsis. 
                            This mark does not appear in <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>, where all the colons are right&#x2014;side up, although the semicolons are upside&#x2014;down, 
                            with the comma atop the point. <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> exhibits no incorrectly formed marks, though only twenty lines carry any punctuation at all. 
                            Still, this correctness, combined with the prominence
                            
                            
                            
                            of poetry densely at the start of the poem, but abandoned punctuation later. 
                            Since the , suggesting that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> gradually lost interest in that feature of the fair copy; 
                            and in both, the punctuation is eccentric, his use of colons seeming more decorative than functional, although his rhetorical use of commas and periods 
                            seems marginally more coherent in the opening lines of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title> <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;Constellations&#x201D;</title> as compared with the opening lines

Presumably, though not certainly, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> made these revisions shortly before fair&#x2014;copying the revised text in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, 
                            perhaps in <date notBefore="1827-09" notAfter="1828-04">late 1827&#x2014;early 1828</date>.

                            In fact, the original fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title>, and not just its revisions, may have only shortly predated the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version&#x2014;or 
                            at least the second page of the fair copy may have been significantly closer in time to the revisions.

                            at this point, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may already have decided to sacrifice this fair copy to revision (see also textual note for line 54).<!--

                        the original manuscript in the photograph is otherwise unknown, as are the occasion and date of its original purpose. 
                        The most valuable information revealed about the original is that it presented a fair&#x2010;copy text that predated 
                        the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version. The <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title> text runs the full length of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version, 
                        but several lines, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> crossed out and replaced by revisions scrawled in the margins, are incorporated in their revised form into the text of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version.</p>
                    
                    <p>Moreover, the photograph <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title> preserves a rare instance a manuscript that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> evidently intended as a presentation copy 
                        but that he spoiled for that purpose with revisions&#x2014;though whether he made the revisions before the original fair copy served its purpose, 
                        or after he had made some formal use of the manuscript, cannot be determined. The original manuscript consisted of a single folded sheet, 
                        with text fair&#x2014;copied on two sides of a single leaf (i.e., pp. 1&#x2013;2), leaving the other leaf (i.e., pp. 3&#x2013;4) blank originally. 
                        The fair&#x2014;copy text is print&#x2014;lettered in a small hand, using pen and ink, thus dating the manuscript as no earlier than <date when="1827-04">April 1827</date>, when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first adopted that medium
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</ref>). Then, at some point after making this fair copy, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> revised lines of the poem, using a cursive hand that is 
                        larger, sprawling, and freer than the original fair&#x2014;copy lettering. He made his initial revisions in pencil and then in several cases overwrote the penciled cursive revisions 
                        using pen and ink, likewise in a cursive hand.</p>
                    
                    <p>On the recto of the first leaf of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRRFT70">RF T70</title> (p. 1 of the original fair&#x2014;copy text), <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote his revisions in the margin of the fair copy; 
                        and on the verso of that leaf (p. 2), he entered his corrections in the margin of the fair copy but extending across the fold 
                        into the facing page (originally blank). Here, too, he revised using pencil and then in some cases overwrote the revisions in ink. 
                        On the verso of the latter leaf (p. 4), he drafted revised lines in cursive using a pen. Pencil cursive text does appear beneath these pen&#x2014;and&#x2014;ink revised lines, 
                        but this pencil cursive handwriting belongs to a different text, unrelated to the constellations poem.</p>
                    
                    On the last page of the folded sheet (i.e., p. 4) in the photograph, revised lines of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> 
                        appear to be written over top of a lighter script of lines that I am unable to connect definitely with any extant fair&#x2010;copy juvenilia: 
                        &#x201C;[to(?)] heaven but / not [to(?)] hell [for when (?)] / they went to / place [I(?)] say [that then (?)] / they took quite / a different way / and . . .&#x201D; 
                        (the writing continues for four more, illegible lines). The scrawled draft suggests notes for a sermon, although it might represent attempted revision of 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> since some lines were given a more pious cast in the final version 
                        (see, e.g., the textual notes for the lines &#x201C;The scales in which twas vainly said / The crime and virtues of men were weighed,&#x201D; and for the closing meditation on the superiority of virtue to knowledge). 
                        No surviving fair&#x2010;copy lines, however, even remotely match the faint draft.-->

                    earliest, a partial pencil draft, which starts with line 27 of the poem. (For

                        rend="italic">b</hi>.) This draft provided the basis for a fair copy in <ref

                        target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref> closely, but which notably omits, at line 64,
                        <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref>&#x02019;s &#x0201C;I
                    end end.&#x0201D; Since even <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref>
                    continues its draft beyond this declaration, Ruskin clearly changed his mind in
                    mid&#45;draft about concluding the poem, and therefore he omitted this line
                    when fair&#45;copying for <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF
                    T70</ref>.</p>
                <p>The <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> version in turn formed the
                    basis for the <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS III</ref> version. <ref
                        type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> itself is a photograph, taken for
                    the <ref type="note" target="libraryedition.html">Library Edition</ref> but
                    unused, of a manuscript whose whereabouts is now unknown (see also <ref
                        type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA: </ref>Contents, <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi>). There appear to be at least three stages of composition reflected in
                    the manuscript.</p>
                <p>First, the photograph shows a neatly printed, ink fair copy, which runs the full
                    length of the poem, adhering to the text of <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS
                        IA</ref> at least from line 27, the first line currently extant. This fair
                    copy, moreover, improves the draft in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS
                        IA</ref> by capitalizing first letters of each line (and capitalizing the
                    entire first word of line 1); by punctiliously punctuating the end of each line,
                    through line 19 (after which end&#45;line punctuation is dropped); and by
                    inserting marginal line numbering at the left of the text.</p>
                <p>Next, the fair copy was used for revision, which appears to be represented in two
                    stages, first apparently in pencil and second in ink. Because the photograph can
                    show only relative darkness and texture of these insertions, the two stages
                    cannot always be definitively distinguished. It is unquestionable, however, that
                    the photograph shows a palimpsest since, in places, a dark ink hand overwrites a
                    much lighter hand, and under magnification the lighter hand shows the variable
                    texture of pencil stroke, and the darker hand the evenness of ink.</p>
                <p>Apparently in the first stage of this revision, someone using the lighter hand
                    marked the ends of lines with a short diagonal line (/), sometimes with a double
                    diagonal (//), but marked other lines with a cross (X), and the latter show
                    cancellations and insertions&#x02014;in the form of strikethrough and caret,
                    within the line; in the form of longhand insertion, in the margin. (Minor
                    variations occur in this pattern.) Presumably, the lines with Xs were flagged
                    for revision, but by whom, and whether by the same person who simultaneously or
                    subsequently wrote the insertion, one can only guess. On the whole, the marginal
                    insertions appear to be in pencil, the same color and texture as the diagonals
                    and Xs. The second stage of revision, insofar as it can be distinguished from
                    the first, appears to be represented by the ink overwriting. But the two stages
                    may be only apparent, and the actual sequence more complex.</p>
                <p>The longhand in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> is somewhat
                    awkward, in keeping with the fact documented in family letters that Ruskin had
                    only recently started practicing longhand as well as the use of ink (see <ref
                        type="note" target="ruskinshand.html">Ruskin&#x02019;s Hand</ref>). It
                    is possible, however, that more than one hand is represented in the
                    revisions.</p>
                <p>There appear to be several possible reasons why the fair copy shown in <ref
                        type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> was sacrificed to revision. Ruskin
                    may have felt that the fair&#45;copy was spoiled by the error in line 54,
                    which he ended with <hi rend="italic">appear,</hi> thus repeating the rhyme word
                    at the end of the previous line, in place of <hi rend="italic">bear,</hi> which
                    ends line 54 in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref>, and to which he
                    returned in <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS III</ref>. Moreover, about the
                    same place, starting with with line 53 in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF
                        T70</ref>, the printing becomes noticeably larger, as if he was suddenly in
                    a hurry. Perhaps most importantly, two significant confusions arise in the sense
                    of the text at about this point.</p>
                <p>First, the pair of couplets starting at line 57 about the Scales and the Milky
                    Way, which made little sense in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref>,
                    made even less sense in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref>; and
                    hence, lines 57&#x02013;60 of <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref>
                    are heavily scored through (and after line 60, Ruskin also stopped marginally
                    numbering the lines). First, it appears, Ruskin revised the first of these
                    couplets, concerning the scales, to arriving at the <ref type="mss"
                        target="3.html">MS III</ref> version (&#x0201C;The scales in which twas
                    vainly said / The crimes and virtues of men were weighed&#x0201D; [lines
                    57&#x02013;58]). Draft for these lines appear in ink draft at the bottom of
                    this sheet, overwriting an earlier, canceled pencil version (that earlier
                    version apparently still related the Scales to the Milky Way, but the lines are
                    largely illegible in the photograph).</p>
                <p>Then, in place of lines 59&#x02013;60 of <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF
                        T70</ref>, concerning the Milky Way, Ruskin composed five new lines and
                    inserted them as lines 65&#x02013;69 of <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS
                        III</ref>. The draft, which is worked out on both sides of the sheet
                    (including what would have been the blank p. 4 of the <ref type="mss"
                        target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> folded fair copy), exhibits some tension
                    between an Evangelical assessment of pagan myths and the classical lines that
                    won out in <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS III</ref>. On p. 4, the
                    underwriting in pencil reads, &#x0201C;[to(?)] heaven but / not [to(?)] hell
                    [for when (?)] / they went to / place [I(?)] say [that then (?)] / they took
                    quite / a different way / and this is all that Ive to say about the beauty [(?)]
                    milky way.&#x0201D; Overwriting this are lines approximating, but not
                    identical to the <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS III</ref> version:
                    &#x0201C;which all their best and bravest trod / of heroes that their
                    countrys good / espoused and neer in angry mood / unto great jupiters blest
                    abode.&#x02019; The final version, in <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS
                        III</ref>, takes a middle way between the Christian piety of the pencil
                    draft and the classical patriotism of the ink draft: &#x0201C;But oh that
                    wonder of them all / Which milky way europeans call / And which the ancients

                            the poem, along with <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName>&#x02BC;s drawing, effectively forms <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;introduction to astronomy&#x201D;; and in the context of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s reading about astronomy, 
                        the poem&#x02BC;s seemingly mechanical exercise of listing the star clusters carries out the method, recommended by <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName>, of &#x201C;remembering these stars

                        <p>In his poem, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> adopts the tactic of <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s tutors by starting from a prominent point of reference&#x2014;not, in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s case, a constellation, but 
                            a planet, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name>, the so&#x2010;called Morning Star and Evening Star, a wandering rather than a fixed star. In this instance, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> is associated with the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> 
                            as these bodies fall below the horizon in the west, and then the poem re&#x2010;orients to the circumpolar constellations overhead 
                            After this, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> carries on to list the formations supposedly in a sequence, the lines of the poem clicking along by repeating &#x201c;next&#x201D;; 
                            however, the organization, although not without logic, becomes more erratic (see <ref type="internal" target="#REAL-LIFE">Real&#x2010;life Observations</ref>).</p>

                            For most of the constellation names and mythological associations, he used a source that remains to be identified. In the editorial glosses to the poem, 
                            some connections are made with books known to have been owned by the family; for the present, the mythology associated with the constellations is glossed 
                            using an American text of the period, <title type="book" corresp="#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><hi rend="italic">Astronomical Recreations</hi></title>

                        <p>It is possible that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> produced this poem by relying entirely on print sources. Despite the simplicity and even numbingly repetitive structure 
                            of its verse catalogue of names, however, the poem prompts significant questions about the context of scientific education in which it was produced. 
                            Did <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> engage in actual stargazing as preparation for any part of the poem. Does the poem reflect conditions of British astronomoical practice 
                            and education in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>? Evidence is limited, but the introduction to astronomy provided by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s familiar scientific dialogues 
                            by <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>, <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>, and <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName> could have not have sustained this poem beyond its opening dozen or so lines.</p>

                            <p>As indicated by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s sources, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> is a bookish poem. 
                                Even in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s books, however, tutors begin study of astronomy by directing their pupils&#x02BC; attention to the evening sky. 
                                To what extent, if any, might <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s composition of his poem have involved actual observation? 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> opens his poem by hailing <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name>. 
                                Planets are not an obvious starting point for charting the constellations: tutors in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s books 
                                typically begin by asking pupils to find <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name>. Nonetheless, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> as the Morning Star or Evening Star and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name> as the red planet present striking objects to introduce young people to stargazing. 
                                Incidentally, the evidence might lend support to dating of the poem.</p>
                            
                            <p>In the poem. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> positions <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> specifically as the Evening Star near the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>.

                                <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name> would have risen from the east, traveling &#x201C;high . . . [in] the sky&#x201D; 
                                a few hours after <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> had set.</p>

                                Astronomically, then, the introduction aligns with the evidence in <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>

                                This convergence of evidence enables us to imagine also that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> looked up from his books to the sky for a phenomenon with which to open his poem.</p>
                            
                            <p>Even so, that search for <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> was likely inspired by <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy Merton</persName>, who, &#x201C;looking up to the sky . . . observed so remarkable a constellation, that he . . . begged to know the name&#x201D;. 
                                On learning it was called <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>, he &#x201C;was so delighted with the grandeur and beauty of this glorious constellation, 
                                that he could not help observing it, by intervals, all the evening; and he was surprised to see that it seemed to pass on, 
                                in a right line drawn from east to west; and that all the stars he had become acquainted with moved every night in the same direction&#x201D;. 
                                In the opening four lines of the poem, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> echoes the alliterative modifiers with which <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName> describes the experience of gazing at the constellations:

                                to trace the poem&#x02BC;s network of constellations overhead. Locating <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major (the Great Bear)</name> in the center of the sky, 
                                the observer would find the &#x201C;pointer&#x201d; stars embedded in <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name> (which forms part of Ursa Major), using these to trace a path

                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem perhaps works like an ersatz globe, listing constellation names in a sequence that oscillates back and forth from west to east and back again, or that possibly circles counter&#x2014;clockwise&#x2014;a pattern, 
                                if he intended any pattern at all, that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> could have plotted only by referencing a celestial globe or illustrated star charts in a book.</p>
                            
                            <p>At line 12, following the circumpolar constellations, the next listed constellation is <name type="astonomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus (the Swan)</name>. 
                                Assuming, for consistency&#x02BC;s sake, the hour of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>&#x02BC;s setting in the west in <date when="1828-04">April 1828</date>, <name type="astonomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus</name> would have lain on the northeast horizon, beyond <name type="astronomical" corresp="#DRACO">Draco</name>. 
                                Then the following item, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSHEART">Cor Caroli (Charles&#x02BC;s Heart)</name> would have directed the viewer back toward the center of the dome, 
                                within <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CANESVENATICI">Canes Venatici (Hunting Dogs)</name>, between <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#COMABERENICES">Coma Berenices</name>. 
                                For the next, the now obsolete constellation, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#TELESCOPIUM"><persName corresp="#WHERSCHEL">Herschell</persName>&#x02BC;s Telescope</name>, one would have turned back toward the west, 
                                where it would have been rising as <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> was setting, located within <name type="astronomical" corresp="#AURIGA">Auriga (the Charioteer)</name>. 
                                The next, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#EQUULEUS">Equuleus (Little Horse)</name>, is found between <name type="astronomical" corresp="#PEGASUSCONSTELLATION">Pegasus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#DELPHINUS">Delphinus</name>, 
                                which would have lain back toward <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus</name>, rising on the northeast horizon as the evening advanced on April 28. The next named constellation, the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ANSER">Goose (Anser)</name>, does keep within range of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#EQUULEUS">Equuleus</name>; 
                                however, to get from <name type="astronomical" corresp="ANSER">Goose</name> to <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Hare</name>&#x2014;<name type="astronomical" corresp="#ANSER">Anser</name> to <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Lepus (hare)</name>&#x2014;again sends one in the opposite direction, to the feet of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>.</p>

                                Since <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LYRA">Lyra</name> is found in the same quadrant as <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ANSER">Anser</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus</name>, by substituting <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Hare</name>, which lies at <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>&#x02BC;s feet, 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> maintained a pattern of back&#x2014;and&#x2014;forth, west&#x2014;to&#x2014;east and back again (or counter&#x2014;clockwise circling), but in naming <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Hare</name> he also 
                                dropped below the celestial equator to &#x201C;some of the southern&#x201D; constellations, as his title mentions. A few lines later, he will plunge into the corresponding southern constellations 
                                on the opposite side with <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CRUX">Crux (Southern Cross)</name>. It seems to break the pattern that, intervening between these southern constellations, 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> lists <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor (Lesser Bear)</name>,

                                his parents take him and his cousin <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MARYME">Mary</persName> to an astronomy lecture at a theater. The performance 
                                features something like the large&#x2014;scale, illuminated or &#x201C;transparent&#x201D; stage orreries with Greek&#x2014;inspired names like <hi rend="italic">Eidouranion</hi>, 
                                which combined the older mechanical, three&#x2014;dimensional orrery that reproduced the revolutions of the sun and planets 
                                with transparancies projected by a magic lantern (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUANGURANIA"><persName corresp="#H-FHUANG">Huang</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HUANGURANIA">&#x201C;When Urania Meets Terpsichore&#x201D;</title></ref>, 49&#x2013;51, 66 n. 23). 
                                For <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>, criticism of these spectacles pertains not just to quack lecturers and creaky, dysfunctional orreries,

                            <p>The theatrical spectacle is a grand but passive presentation, discouraging learning through experience and self&#x2014;discovery. 
                                Even though <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> had failed to complete his own orrery because he over&#x2014;reached his abilities, the stage orrery is 
                                &#x201C;particularly interesting to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName>&#x201D; thanks only to &#x201C;the pains he had taken, and the various attempts he had made,

                                <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s most severe criticism is aimed at the failure to scale knowledge to the age&#x2014;appropriate accessibility of young listeners. 
                                The lecturer overwhelms the audience &#x201C;with a vast number of words, which&#x201D; <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> &#x201C;strained his attention&#x201D; to understand,

                                            and refresh themselves while this lasted. They went into a cool room, where they eat oranges and biscuits,

                                    but embedded in a peroration on the infinitude of the universe: &#x201C;. . . how in adequate must the utmost stretch of finite faculties be to represent infinity! 
                                    The stars, disposed in constellations, and surrounded by concentric circles, may perhaps assist the imagination a little: 
                                    The attempt in the <title type="lesson" corresp="#WALKERLASTSCENE">LAST SCENE</title>, if not admired, we hope will be forgiven. But was it possible we could actually take our flight 
                                    into infinite space, or be borne on the wings of lightning, to the most distant fixed Star we can now see, even there, 
                                    perhaps we should find ourselves on the confines of creation, and see as many stars before us as we left behind! 
                                    For space has neither top nor bottom in it; it is a circle whose centre is every where, but whose circumference is no where!&#x201D; (pp. 36&#x2013;37).</item>

                            <p>According to this description, the <title type="lesson" corresp="#WALKERLASTSCENE">&#x201C;Last Scene&#x201D;</title>, at least as delivered by the Walker family, 
                                which by <date when="1828">1828</date> had passed into the management of <persName corresp="#DFW">Deane Franklin Walker</persName> (<date notBefore="1778" notAfter="1865">1778&#x2013;1865</date> [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUANGURANIA"><persName corresp="#H-FHUANG">Huang</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HUANGURANIA">&#x201C;When Urania Meets Terpsichore&#x201D;</title></ref>, 50]), 
                                the most comprehensive view of the constellations was presented as the finale. Could <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> have conceived of his poem 
                                as an ekphrastic version of this final, totalizing scene? Apparently, in this show, a transparency 
                                exhibited a circle of the starry night, surrounded by concentric rings to suggest infinitude. 
                                In an engraving by <persName corresp="#ISTOW">I.

                                    appeared on the Evening of the <date when="1817-03-21">21st March 1817</date>, with Walker&#x02BC;s Exhibition of the Eidouranion</hi></title>, published by <persName corresp="#RW">Robert Wilkinson</persName>, 
                                Scene 1 represented the earth and sun by turning the orbit vertically to the audience, enclosing this revolution of the Eidouranion within a projection of an outer ring, which showed the Zodiac constellations. 
                                The Zodiac constellations were represented by their respective mythological figures. 
                                Perhaps the transparency for the Last Scene exhibited a similar ring of constellations in their mythological guise,
                                which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in his way has reproduced.</p>
                            
                            <p>The beginning of the poem, however, starts with a version of Scene 1 in the Walkers&#x02BC; exhibition&#x2014;or more precisely, a portion of their Scene 4&#x2014;with 
                                the rising and setting of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name>. As noted earlier, the poem is atypical of <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                                introductions to the constellations, which begin with finding the circumpolar constellations in the sky. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                                incorporates that observation as the second stage of his poem. The Zodiac constellations form a distinct piece within the poem. 
                                The most significant point to draw from the context of the Lenten astronomy lectures is that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s catalogue 
                                may have attempted a sublime totality, an expression of religious awe.</p>
