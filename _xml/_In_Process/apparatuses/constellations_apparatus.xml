                    <head type="section">Title</head>
                    <p>In the earlier of two surviving fair copies of the poem (see <ref type="internal" target="#MAJORMS">Manuscripts</ref>), 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="rft70_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title></ref>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> centered 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">THE CONSTELLATIONS</hi>&#x0201D;</title> above the column of lines. 
                        Then, in what appears an afterthought, he added &#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">NORTHERN</hi>&#x0201D; to the right in the margin, on the baseline of the main title; 
                        and on a second line below &#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">NORTHERN</hi>&#x0201D;, he placed awkwardly in the margin, to the right of the opening lines of the poem, 
                        &#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">SOME OF THE ZODIAC / AND SOME OF THE SOUTHERN</hi>&#x0201D;. 
                        The added, trailing subtitle suggests that he extended the title as he expanded the poem, perhaps revealing one reason why he gave up 
                        on this fair&#x2010;copy manuscript, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>, revised some of its lines on the same copy (see <ref type="internal" corresp="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>), 
                        and made a new fair copy incorporating these changes.</p>
                    <p>In the second surviving fair copy, in <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> incorporated his revisions to the first fair copy, including 
                        allowing space to center the subtitle properly below the main title and above the first line, breaking the three lines as 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">THE CONSTELLATIONS / NORTHERN, SOME OF THE ZODIAC AND / SOME OF THE SOUTHERN</hi>&#x0201D;</title>.</p>
                    <p>The fragment of draft of the poem, which is bound in <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title></ref>, 
                        is untitled. The surviving pages begin with lines from the middle of the poem.</p>

                    <p>A facsimile in the form of two photographs, <ref type="apparatus" target="rft70_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title></ref>, 
                        is held by <orgName corresp="#RUSKINLIBRARYLANCASTER">The Ruskin</orgName>. The photographs apparently were taken during preparation of the 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title></ref>, but they were not used. 
                        The original manuscript shown in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title> consisted of a single folded sheet, with text fair&#x2014;copied on two sides of a single leaf (i.e., pp. 1&#x2013;2), 
                        leaving the other leaf (i.e., pp. 3&#x2013;4) originally blank. In the photographs, the folded sheet is spread open and laid flat, 
                        one photograph showing pages 4 and 1 (from left to right), and the other photograph showing the reverse side, pages 2 and 3 (from left to right).</p>
                        
                        <p>These facsimiles preserve perhaps the only known instance of a manuscript containing a fair copy of any early work by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> that he subsequently revised using the same sheet. 
                            The original fair&#x2014;copy text of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> shown in the photographs is print&#x2010;lettered in a small hand, using pen and ink, thus dating the manuscript as no earlier than <date notBefore="1827-04" notAfter="1827-05">April&#x2013;May 1827</date>, 
                            when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first adopted that medium, and probably later in that year, when he had gained more facility
                            (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</ref>). Then, at some point after making this fair copy, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> revised various lines of the poem, using a cursive hand that is 
                            larger, sprawling, and freer than the original fair&#x2014;copy lettering. He made his initial revisions in pencil and then in some cases overwrote the penciled cursive revisions 
                            using pen and ink, likewise in a cursive hand. Whether <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> made the revisions before the original fair copy served its purpose, 
                            or revised it after he had made some formal use of the manuscript, cannot be determined.</p>
                        
                    <p>On the recto of the first leaf shown in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title> (p. 1 of the original fair&#x2014;copy text), <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote his revisions in the margin of the fair copy; 
                        and on the verso of that leaf (p. 2), he entered his corrections in the margin of the fair copy but extending across the fold 
                        into the facing page (originally blank). Here, too, he revised using pencil and then in some cases overwrote the revisions in ink. 
                        On the verso of the latter leaf (p. 4), he drafted revised lines in cursive using a pen.</p>
                        
                        <p>On the last page of the folded sheet (i.e., p. 4), the revised lines of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> 
                            are written over top of a lighter script of lines that I am unable to connect definitively with any extant fair&#x2010;copy juvenilia: 
                            &#x201C;[to(?)] heaven but / not [to(?)] hell [for when (?)] / they went to / place [I(?)] say [that then (?)] / they took quite / a different way / and . . .&#x201D; 
                            (the writing continues for four more, illegible lines). The scrawled draft suggests notes for a sermon, although it might represent attempted revision of 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> since some lines were given a more pious cast in the final version 
                            (see, e.g., the textual notes for the lines &#x201C;The scales in which twas vainly said / The crime and virtues of men were weighed,&#x201D; and for the closing meditation on the superiority of virtue to knowledge). 
                            No surviving fair&#x2010;copy lines, however, even remotely match the faint draft.</p>

                        They do not mention the manuscript that they apparently knew at some point in time from the photograph,

                        The editors&#x02BC; dating, judging by their only other mention of the poem, was based on an association of its fragment of rough draft 
                        with another fragmentary rough draft, similar in appearance, of <ref type="apparatus" target="monastery_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title></ref>

                        The editors bound both fragments in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>.</p>
                    
                    <p>There is no question that the earliest surviving manuscript is the <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title></ref> draft, 
                        <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIACONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;cepheus and bootes now&#x201d;</title>. 
                        Its text was the basis for the fair&#x2010;copy photographed as <ref type="apparatus" target="rft70_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title></ref> (or the basis, at least, of the portion of text it represents). 
                        In turn, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title> became copytext for the 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref> fair copy, 
                        which incorporates <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s revisions in the margins of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>

                    <p>Internal evidence suggests that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have based the first lines of the poem 
                        on actual observation of the sky. The alignment of planets and constellations described at the beginning of the poem 
                        would have been observable in <date notBefore="1828-04" notAfter="1828-05">April&#x2013;May 1828</date>,

                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</ref>). Physical evidence of both fair&#x2010;copy manuscripts, 
                        moreover, strongly suggests a date in <date when="1827">1828</date> for those stages of the poem. Open to question is whether composition of the draft could have begun in

                        is the possibility that certain details were dependent on actual observation of the sky

                        Those details occur in the opening lines of the poem as fair&#x2010;copied; and since those lines are missing from the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> draft, 
                        this possible real&#x2010;life factor cannot be confirmed as an influence on composition. Thus, a genesis of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> draft commencing perhaps in <date notBefore="1827-10" notAfter="1827-12">the fourth quarter of 1827</date> cannot be ruled out 
                        (and if the draft&#x02BC;s opening lines were found to be identical with those in the fair copies, the lines&#x02BC; origin in real&#x2010;life observation would probably have to rejected).

                        In a scenario of initial composition in <date notBefore="1827-10" notAfter="1827-12">late 1827</date>, the first fair copy would have succumbed to revision, and the second fair copy inscribed into <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>,

                    <p>From surviving documents, a clear chronology is established based on revisions of one document being incorporated in the next. 
                        Strikethroughs and substitutions in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> pencil draft 
                        contribute to the base text of the fair copy shown in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>; 
                        and strikethroughs and substitutions in the latter are incorporated into copytext used for the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair copy. 
                        This genetic history tracks a similar and roughly contemporaneous record of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s development of the poem, <ref type="apparatus" target="monastery_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title></ref>,

                    <p>As a stage of development in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s compositional methods, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> along with 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> represent a significant advance, which started with learning to use pen and ink in <date when="1827-04">April 1827</date> 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</ref>). For the first time, we see preserved draft containing deletions, substitutions, and insertions, both in pencil and in ink. 
                        Perhaps the preservation was accidental, and the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> draft manuscripts only seem to bear witness to a maturing process of revision because earlier forms of draft were more ephemeral, such as slate writing. 
                        It is equally possible, however, that the rough draft manuscripts in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> draft were preserved <hi rend="italic">because</hi> they bear witness to a new, more deliberate revision process. 
                        The <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title> manuscript is especially noteworthy, and perhaps unique, as a fair copy that was sacrificed to revision on the same document.</p>

                        <p>The item of draft contained in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>,

                            Written in pencil in a cursive hand, the fragment starts at line 27 of the poem as fair&#x02010;copied, picking up with what reads as the midst of a catalogue of stars already underway. 
                            This draft extends for forty lines to the last&#x0201;mentioned of the constellations in all three versions, the goat or <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CAPRICORN">Capricorn</name>, 
                                which is line 64 of the final version of the poem in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>. 
                            This final line of the draft in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> (2r) includes or is adjacent to the phrase &#x201C;I end end&#x201D; (written in part with ink), apparently identifying this line as the original ending of the poem, 
                            as conceived at this stage of development. The phrase is omitted from this line, however, as fair&#x2014;copied 
                            in both <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title> and <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>&#x2014;the latter two versions 
                            carrying on with perorarations of nine lines and fourteen lines respectively (the concluding passage in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title> being subjected to considerable revision, 
                            which is reflected in the text as fair&#x2014;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>).</p>
                        
                        <p>As originally concluded, therefore, the version of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> 
                            represented by <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> was less pretentious poetically, aiming solely at a catalogue of stars. 
                            In this respect, the first version of the poem resembles lists of constellations that could be found in various sources 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#DISCUSSION">Discussion: Print Sources</ref>). <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s chief original contribution to such lists appears to be the epithets describing each constellation, 
                            though it must be cautioned that his source remains to be identified, which may have originated or suggested his adjectives.</p>
                        
                        <p>If some inferences can be drawn from the ending of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> text, 
                            nothing can be hazarded about the original beginning. The text starts at the top of 1r of the manuscript, 
                            lacking title or context, evidently in mid&#x2014;career of the poem. (It is possible that the missing, opening piece of the manuscript 
                            did once exist as originally bound in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, which in its current state has been damaged and unbound, with possible losses of contents;

                            The ink cursive hand, especially in style of punctuation and revision using strikethrough, resembles

                            and the marks are used exclusively at the ends of lines. This obsessive but uninformed observance abruptly ceases at book 2, line 80, at the top of page 79 of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>. 
                            Just so, the end of every line of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title> <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;Constellations&#x201D;</title> fair copy is notched with a punctuation mark until line 20, 
                            where the practice abruptly stops. Where used, the punctuation marks often seem arbitrary. While the full&#x2014;stop periods usually make grammatical sense, 
                            the commas, colons, and (especially in <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>) an upside&#x2014;down semicolon seem interchangeable. 
                            It appears that, in both these fair copies, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> layered over the texts 
                            with bookish punctuation to give the appearance of print, without understanding the grammatical and rhetorical function of the marks&#x2014;until, that is, he tired of the process and stopped altogether at an arbitrary place. 
                            A final bookish touch in both manuscripts is to number the lines by fives in the left margin.</p>

                            can be triangulated with a third fair copy, that of <ref type="apparatus" target="eudosia_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201c;Eudosia&#x201d;</title></ref>,

                            the punctuation ending each line until it doesn&#x02BC;t, and the line numbering on the left. <title type="poem" corresp="#JREUSODIA">&#x201C;Eudosia&#x201D;</title> displays a bizarre punctuation mark formed from two horizontal dots, like a colon on its side or a two&#x2014;point ellipsis. 
                            This mark does not appear in <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>, where all the colons are right&#x2014;side up, but the semicolons are upside&#x2014;down,

                        but several lines, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> crossed out and replaced by revisions scrawled in the margins, are incorporated in their revised form into the text of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version.</p>
                    
                    
                <p>The <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref> version appears to be the
                    earliest, a partial pencil draft, which starts with line 27 of the poem. (For
                    possible records of a now missing sheet of this draft, containing the opening 26
                    lines, see <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA: </ref>Contents, <hi
                        rend="italic">b</hi>.) This draft provided the basis for a fair copy in <ref
                        type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref>, which follows <ref type="mss"
                        target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref> closely, but which notably omits, at line 64,
                        <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref>&#x02019;s &#x0201C;I
                    end end.&#x0201D; Since even <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref>
                    continues its draft beyond this declaration, Ruskin clearly changed his mind in
                    mid&#45;draft about concluding the poem, and therefore he omitted this line
                    when fair&#45;copying for <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF
                    T70</ref>.</p>
                <p>The <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> version in turn formed the
                    basis for the <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS III</ref> version. <ref
                        type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> itself is a photograph, taken for
                    the <ref type="note" target="libraryedition.html">Library Edition</ref> but
                    unused, of a manuscript whose whereabouts is now unknown (see also <ref
                        type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA: </ref>Contents, <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi>). There appear to be at least three stages of composition reflected in
                    the manuscript.</p>
                <p>First, the photograph shows a neatly printed, ink fair copy, which runs the full
                    length of the poem, adhering to the text of <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS
                        IA</ref> at least from line 27, the first line currently extant. This fair
                    copy, moreover, improves the draft in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS
                        IA</ref> by capitalizing first letters of each line (and capitalizing the
                    entire first word of line 1); by punctiliously punctuating the end of each line,
                    through line 19 (after which end&#45;line punctuation is dropped); and by
                    inserting marginal line numbering at the left of the text.</p>
                <p>Next, the fair copy was used for revision, which appears to be represented in two
                    stages, first apparently in pencil and second in ink. Because the photograph can
                    show only relative darkness and texture of these insertions, the two stages
                    cannot always be definitively distinguished. It is unquestionable, however, that
                    the photograph shows a palimpsest since, in places, a dark ink hand overwrites a
                    much lighter hand, and under magnification the lighter hand shows the variable
                    texture of pencil stroke, and the darker hand the evenness of ink.</p>
                <p>Apparently in the first stage of this revision, someone using the lighter hand
                    marked the ends of lines with a short diagonal line (/), sometimes with a double
                    diagonal (//), but marked other lines with a cross (X), and the latter show
                    cancellations and insertions&#x02014;in the form of strikethrough and caret,
                    within the line; in the form of longhand insertion, in the margin. (Minor
                    variations occur in this pattern.) Presumably, the lines with Xs were flagged
                    for revision, but by whom, and whether by the same person who simultaneously or
                    subsequently wrote the insertion, one can only guess. On the whole, the marginal
                    insertions appear to be in pencil, the same color and texture as the diagonals
                    and Xs. The second stage of revision, insofar as it can be distinguished from
                    the first, appears to be represented by the ink overwriting. But the two stages
                    may be only apparent, and the actual sequence more complex.</p>
                <p>The longhand in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> is somewhat
                    awkward, in keeping with the fact documented in family letters that Ruskin had
                    only recently started practicing longhand as well as the use of ink (see <ref
                        type="note" target="ruskinshand.html">Ruskin&#x02019;s Hand</ref>). It
                    is possible, however, that more than one hand is represented in the
                    revisions.</p>
                <p>There appear to be several possible reasons why the fair copy shown in <ref
                        type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> was sacrificed to revision. Ruskin
                    may have felt that the fair&#45;copy was spoiled by the error in line 54,
                    which he ended with <hi rend="italic">appear,</hi> thus repeating the rhyme word
                    at the end of the previous line, in place of <hi rend="italic">bear,</hi> which
                    ends line 54 in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref>, and to which he
                    returned in <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS III</ref>. Moreover, about the
                    same place, starting with with line 53 in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF
                        T70</ref>, the printing becomes noticeably larger, as if he was suddenly in
                    a hurry. Perhaps most importantly, two significant confusions arise in the sense
                    of the text at about this point.</p>
                <p>First, the pair of couplets starting at line 57 about the Scales and the Milky
                    Way, which made little sense in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">MS IA</ref>,
                    made even less sense in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref>; and
                    hence, lines 57&#x02013;60 of <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref>
                    are heavily scored through (and after line 60, Ruskin also stopped marginally
                    numbering the lines). First, it appears, Ruskin revised the first of these
                    couplets, concerning the scales, to arriving at the <ref type="mss"
                        target="3.html">MS III</ref> version (&#x0201C;The scales in which twas
                    vainly said / The crimes and virtues of men were weighed&#x0201D; [lines
                    57&#x02013;58]). Draft for these lines appear in ink draft at the bottom of
                    this sheet, overwriting an earlier, canceled pencil version (that earlier
                    version apparently still related the Scales to the Milky Way, but the lines are
                    largely illegible in the photograph).</p>
                <p>Then, in place of lines 59&#x02013;60 of <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF
                        T70</ref>, concerning the Milky Way, Ruskin composed five new lines and
                    inserted them as lines 65&#x02013;69 of <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS
                        III</ref>. The draft, which is worked out on both sides of the sheet
                    (including what would have been the blank p. 4 of the <ref type="mss"
                        target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref> folded fair copy), exhibits some tension
                    between an Evangelical assessment of pagan myths and the classical lines that
                    won out in <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS III</ref>. On p. 4, the
                    underwriting in pencil reads, &#x0201C;[to(?)] heaven but / not [to(?)] hell
                    [for when (?)] / they went to / place [I(?)] say [that then (?)] / they took
                    quite / a different way / and this is all that Ive to say about the beauty [(?)]
                    milky way.&#x0201D; Overwriting this are lines approximating, but not
                    identical to the <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS III</ref> version:
                    &#x0201C;which all their best and bravest trod / of heroes that their
                    countrys good / espoused and neer in angry mood / unto great jupiters blest
                    abode.&#x02019; The final version, in <ref type="mss" target="3.html">MS
                        III</ref>, takes a middle way between the Christian piety of the pencil
                    draft and the classical patriotism of the ink draft: &#x0201C;But oh that
                    wonder of them all / Which milky way europeans call / And which the ancients
                    thought the road / Which all their best and bravest trod / Unto great Jupiters
                    blest abode.&#x0201D; (The first three lines of this version are worked out
                    in ink draft on p. 3 [inside spread, recto] of <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html"
                        >RF T70</ref>, &#x0201C;but oh that wonder of them all / which milky way
                    europeans call / and which the ancients thought the road.&#x0201D;)</p>
                <p>Another confusion toward the end of the <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF
                        T70</ref> fair copy (line 64, or line 62 in <ref type="mss" target="3.html"
                        >MS III</ref>), which may have contributed to Ruskin&#x02019;s giving up
                    this fair copy to revision, arose evidently from a muddle over the order of the
                    constellations, which failed to conform with the linear order of his <ref
                        type="note" target="catalog.html">catalog poem</ref>. Line 64 in the earlier
                    version, &#x0201C;I wish I had not observed the lyre,&#x0201D; harkened
                    back to line 17, &#x0201C;After that doth come the lyre.&#x0201D; At
                    both these points in <ref type="mss" target="xxx.html">RF T70</ref>, a revision
                    about the &#x0201C;frightened hare&#x0201D; is entered in the margin,
                    which ultimately replaced line 17.</p>
                <p>The hand for these changes indicate a growing hurry and restlessness. As
                    suggested in Date, the evidence may point to hurried preparations for New

                                fixing on the familiar circumpolar group, but then darts around the celestial globe, naming &#x201C;some&#x201D; in the north, &#x201C;some&#x201D; in the south, and &#x201C;some&#x201D; in the Zodiac, seemingly at random.</p>

                                where he adapts <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s tactic of starting from a prominent point of reference in the sky&#x2014;not,

                                a wandering rather than a fixed star. In this instance, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> is associated with the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> 
                                as these bodies fall below the horizon in the west, and then the poem re&#x2010;orients to the circumpolar constellations overhead. Following this practical introduction, 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> carries on to list the formations supposedly in a sequence, the lines of the poem clicking along by repeating &#x201c;next&#x201D;, 
                                but the organization becomes erratic, albeit with some elements of logic (see <ref type="internal" target="#REAL-LIFE">Real&#x2010;life Observations</ref>).</p>

                            Did <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> engage in actual stargazing as preparation for any part of the poem? Does the poem reflect conditions of British astronomoical practice

                                Even in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s books, however, tutors begin study of astronomy by directing their pupils&#x02BC; attention to the evening sky. 
                                To what extent, if any, might <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s composition of his poem have involved actual observation? 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> opens his poem by hailing <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name>. 
                                Planets are not an obvious starting point for charting the constellations: tutors in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s books 
                                typically begin by asking pupils to find <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name>. As suggested by an earlier poem, 
                                <ref type="apparatus" target="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#GLENOFGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;)</title></ref>, 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had long been able to orient himself that far to the night sky. 
                                Equally striking objects for young stargazers are <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name>, the Morning Star or Evening Star, and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name>, the red planet. 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s observation of the alignment of those planets could also lend support to dating of the poem.</p>
                           
                            <p>In the poem, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> positions <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> specifically as the Evening Star near the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>.
                                According to a digital&#x2010;age star chart, the <title type="website" corresp="#SKYANDTELESCOPE">Sky &#x0026; Telescope Interactive Sky Chart</title>, 
                                <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> would have been visible from <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> as the Evening Star, 
                                setting in the west along with <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>m 
                                during <date notBefore="1828-04" notAfter="1828-06">April&#x2013;June 1828</date>. During those same months, 
                                <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name> would have risen from the east, traveling &#x201C;high . . . [in] the sky&#x201D; 
                                a few hours after <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> had set.</p>
                                <!--(Another bright object at that time, appearing low in the evening sky, which an observer might have confused with a planet, was <name type="astronomical" corresp="#SIRIUS">Sirius or &#x201C;Dog Star&#x201d;</name>, 
                        in the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CANISMAJOR">Canis Major</name> directly below <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>.)-->
                            
                            <p>This particular configuration of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name>, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name>, and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> did not appear at any other time in <date when="1828">1828</date>, and did not occur at all in <date when="1827">1827</date>. 
                                Astronomically, then, the poem&#x02BC;s introduction aligns with the evidence in <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref> 
                                supporting the year <date when="1828">1828</date> as a probable period of composition or at least revision. April&#x2013;May was the period when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> tyically prepared poems for his father&#x02BC;s birthday in May, 
                                thus suggesting an occasion as well as a terminus a quo for the start of either composition or revision of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title>

                                This convergence of evidence enables us to imagine also that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> looked up from his books to the sky for a phenomenon with which to open his poem.</p>
                            
                            <p>Even so, that search for <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> was likely inspired by <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy Merton</persName>, who, &#x201C;looking up to the sky . . . observed so remarkable a constellation, that he . . . begged to know the name&#x201D;. 
                                On learning it was called <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>, he &#x201C;was so delighted with the grandeur and beauty of this glorious constellation, 
                                that he could not help observing it, by intervals, all the evening; and he was surprised to see that it seemed to pass on, 
                                in a right line drawn from east to west; and that all the stars he had become acquainted with moved every night in the same direction&#x201D;. 
                                In the opening four lines of the poem, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> echoes the alliterative modifiers with which <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName> describes the experience of gazing at the constellations:

                                constellations, as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> specified among the classifications tagged onto his main title. Of the constellations named in lines 7&#x2013;11 of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, 
                                only <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name> is mentioned by the tutors in <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s dialogues. 
                                An observer in <date when="1828-04">April 1828</date> could, however, easily have followed <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cues by 
                                looking up from <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> setting in the west 
                                to trace the poem&#x02BC;s network of constellations overhead. Locating <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major (the Great Bear)</name> in the center of the sky, 
                                the observer would find the &#x201C;pointer&#x201d; stars embedded in <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name> (which forms part of Ursa Major), using these to trace a path 
                                to the tip of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#DRACO">Draco (the Dragon)</name>&#x02BC;s tail. Following the wind of the tail toward the northeast, the observer would turn to the east to encounter 
                                <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CORONABOREALIS">Corona Borealis (the Northern Crown)</name>. Continuing to circle counter&#x2014;clockwise back toward <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major</name>, 
                                the observer would have found the next named constellation in the poem, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#COMABERENICES">Coma Berenices (Berenice&#x02BC;s Hair)</name>.</p>
                            
                            <p>Hereafter in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, following the mapping of the circumpolar constellations, 
                                the sequence of constellations becomes more erratic, with <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s repeated &#x201C;next comes&#x201D; 
                                ceasing necessarily to refer to formations that are adjacent in the dome of the sky. 
                                In the second fair copy, in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                                forestalled objections by adding the a note with the caveat: &#x201C;These constellations though they are next in this poetry are not next in the sky&#x201d;. 
                                It is impossible to know whether he added the note because he only then discovered the confusion or because he was prodded to justify 
                                a more poetic than naturalistic procedure that he had adopted from the start.</p>

                            <p>Certainly the poem is interested more in naming than in mapping; the poem is a catalogue, not a star chart. 
                                At the same time, neither is it a narrative&#x2014;despite mythic storytelling being the expected alternative to a scientific or practical approach. 
                                If <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poetic naming suggests a distant and, in some cases, contradictory relation to the myths commonly associated

                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem can perhaps be viewed as an ersatz globe, listing constellation names in a sequence that oscillates back and forth from west to east and back again, or that possibly (in places) circles counter&#x2014;clockwise&#x2014;a pattern, 
                                if he intended any pattern at all, that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> could have plotted only by referencing a celestial globe or illustrated star charts in a book.</p>
                            
                            <p>One can test this theory by searching for a pattern in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s sequence of constellations. 
                                At line 12, following the circumpolar constellations, the next listed constellation is <name type="astonomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus (the Swan)</name>. 
                                Assuming, for consistency&#x02BC;s sake, the hour of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>&#x02BC;s setting in the west in <date when="1828-04">April 1828</date>, <name type="astonomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus</name> would have lain on the northeast horizon, beyond <name type="astronomical" corresp="#DRACO">Draco</name>. 
                                Then the following item, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSHEART">Cor Caroli (Charles&#x02BC;s Heart)</name> would have directed the viewer back toward the center of the dome, 
                                within <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CANESVENATICI">Canes Venatici (Hunting Dogs)</name>, between <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#COMABERENICES">Coma Berenices</name>. 
                                For the next, the now obsolete constellation, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#TELESCOPIUM"><persName corresp="#WHERSCHEL">Herschell</persName>&#x02BC;s Telescope</name>, one would have turned back toward the west, 
                                where it would have been rising as <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> was setting, located within <name type="astronomical" corresp="#AURIGA">Auriga (the Charioteer)</name>. 
                                The next, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#EQUULEUS">Equuleus (Little Horse)</name>, is found between <name type="astronomical" corresp="#PEGASUSCONSTELLATION">Pegasus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#DELPHINUS">Delphinus</name>, 
                                which would have lain back toward <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus</name>, rising on the northeast horizon as the evening advanced on April 28. The next named constellation, the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ANSER">Goose (Anser)</name>, does keep within range of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#EQUULEUS">Equuleus</name>; 
                                however, to get from <name type="astronomical" corresp="ANSER">Goose</name> to <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Hare</name>&#x2014;<name type="astronomical" corresp="#ANSER">Anser</name> to <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Lepus (hare)</name>&#x2014;again sends one in the opposite direction, to the feet of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>.</p>
                            
                            <p>At this point in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title> draft, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> originally cited <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LYRA">Lyra (the Lyre)</name>, which he replaced with <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Lepus (Hare)</name>. 
                                Since <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LYRA">Lyra</name> is found in the same quadrant as <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ANSER">Anser</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus</name>, by substituting <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Hare</name>, which lies at <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>&#x02BC;s feet, 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> maintained a pattern of back&#x2010;and&#x2010;forth, west&#x2010;to&#x2010;east and back again (or counter&#x2010;clockwise circling), but in naming <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Hare</name> he also 
                                dropped below the celestial equator to &#x201C;some of the southern&#x201D; constellations, as his title mentions. A few lines later, he will plunge into the corresponding southern constellations 
                                on the opposite side with <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CRUX">Crux (Southern Cross)</name>. It seems to break the pattern that, intervening between these southern constellations, 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> lists <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor (Lesser Bear)</name>, 
                                which contains the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#POLARIS">Pole Star</name>, but perhaps he paused midway across the sky only to rhyme <hi rend="italic">hare</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bear</hi>. 
                                He may also have wanted <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor</name>. to stand as a barrier between <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ANSER">Anser</name>, &#x201C;stupid goose&#x201D;, and &#x201C;cunning fox&#x201D; (<name type="astronomical" corresp="#VULPECULAETANSER">Vulpecula</name>), 
                                which follows <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor</name> in the list. Traditionally, Fox and Goose were treated as a single constellation, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VULPECULAETANSER">Vulpecula et Anser</name>, 
                                with the Goose caught in the Fox&#x02BC;s mouth (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><persName corresp="#IRIDPATH">Ridpath</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><hi rend="italic">Star Tales</hi></title></ref>, 182&#x2013;83). 
                                By separating them, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> characteristically avoided violence.</p>
                            
                            <p>It seems a fool&#x02BC;s errand to look for an equivalent of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName>&#x02BC;s paper globe 
                                in what <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself characterized as a poetic order&#x2014;&#x201C;constellations . . . next in this poetry . . . not next in the sky&#x201d;. 
                                Whatever poetic idea directed his eye (and intriguingly, governed his choices for revision) in moving from constellation to constellation, 
                                the most dramatic poetic evolution of the poem lay in the addition and revision of the poem&#x02BC;s conclusion in the two fair copies. 
                                For this development, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have looked neither to a real nor a paper sky, 
                                but to a theatrical projection.</p>

                                which combined technology with art, modern science with traditional elements such as the Zodiac. The popular astronomy lecture was a theatrical entertainment,

                                After <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> has attempted and failed on his own to construct an <hi rend="italic">orrery</hi>, a model of the solar system, 
                                his parents take him and his cousin <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MARYME">Mary</persName> to an astronomy lecture at a theater. The performance 
                                features something like the large&#x2014;scale, illuminated or &#x201C;transparent&#x201D; stage orreries with Greek&#x2014;inspired names like <hi rend="italic">Eidouranion</hi>, 
                                which combined the older mechanical, three&#x2014;dimensional orrery that reproduced the revolutions of the sun and planets 
                                with transparancies projected by a magic lantern (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUANGURANIA"><persName corresp="#H-FHUANG">Huang</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HUANGURANIA">&#x201C;When Urania Meets Terpsichore&#x201D;</title></ref>, 49&#x2013;51, 66 n. 23). 
                                For <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>, criticism of these spectacles pertains not just to quack lecturers and creaky, dysfunctional orreries, 
                                which <persName corresp="#H-FHUANG">Huang</persName> finds in satires of the day (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUANGURANIA"><title type="essay" corresp="#HUANGURANIA">&#x201C;When Urania Meets Terpsichore&#x201D;</title></ref>, 62&#x2013;63); more fundamentally, 
                                <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName> points to conflicts with reformers&#x02BC; principles of effective pedagogy.</p>
                            
                            <p>The theatrical spectacle is a grand but passive presentation, discouraging learning through experience and self&#x2014;discovery. 
                                Even though <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> had failed to complete his own orrery because he over&#x2014;reached his abilities, the stage orrery is 
                                &#x201C;particularly interesting to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName>&#x201D; thanks only to &#x201C;the pains he had taken, and the various attempts he had made,

                                and &#x201C;even he&#x201D;, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName>, &#x201C;after all his reading in <title type="book" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></title>, had much difficulty sometimes in understanding both the machine and the lecturer&#x201D;. 
                                <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s most severe criticism is aimed at the failure to scale knowledge to the age&#x2014;appropriate accessibility of young listeners. 
                                The lecturer overwhelms the audience &#x201C;with a vast number of words, which&#x201D; <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> &#x201C;strained his attention&#x201D; to understand, 
                                trusting that the lengthy explanations &#x201C;were all necessary&#x201D;, yet &#x201C;of which nearly half were nothing to the purpose&#x201D; and put <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MARYME">Mary</persName> to sleep altogether.

                                    The stars, disposed in constellations, and surrounded by concentric circles, may perhaps assist the imagination a little: 
                                    The attempt in the <title type="lesson" corresp="#WALKERLASTSCENE">LAST SCENE</title>, if not admired, we hope will be forgiven. But was it possible we could actually take our flight 
                                    into infinite space, or be borne on the wings of lightning, to the most distant fixed Star we can now see, even there, 
                                    perhaps we should find ourselves on the confines of creation, and see as many stars before us as we left behind! 
                                    For space has neither top nor bottom in it; it is a circle whose centre is every where, but whose circumference is no where!&#x201D; (pp. 36&#x2013;37).</item>

                                which by <date when="1828">1828</date> had passed into the management of <persName corresp="#DFW">Deane Franklin Walker</persName> (<date notBefore="1778" notAfter="1865">1778&#x2013;1865</date> [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUANGURANIA"><persName corresp="#H-FHUANG">Huang</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HUANGURANIA">&#x201C;When Urania Meets Terpsichore&#x201D;</title></ref>, 50]), 
                                the most comprehensive view of the constellations was presented as the finale. Could <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> have conceived of his poem 
                                as an ekphrastic version of this final, totalizing scene? Apparently, in this show, a transparency 
                                exhibited a circle of the starry night, surrounded by concentric rings to suggest infinitude. 
                                In an engraving by <persName corresp="#ISTOW">I. Stow</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1770" notAfter="1823">1770&#x2013;1823</date>), after <persName corresp="#EBURNEY">E. F.

                                Scene 1 represented the earth and sun by turning the orbit vertically to the audience, enclosing this revolution of the Eidouranion within a projection of an outer ring, which showed the Zodiac constellations. 
                                The Zodiac constellations were represented by their respective mythological figures. 
                                Perhaps the transparency for the Last Scene exhibited a similar ring of constellations in their mythological guise,
                                which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in his way has reproduced.</p>
                            
                            <p>The beginning of the poem, however, starts with a version of Scene 1 in the Walkers&#x02BC; exhibition&#x2014;or more precisely, a portion of their Scene 4&#x2014;with 
                                the rising and setting of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name>. As noted earlier, the poem is atypical of <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                                introductions to the constellations, which begin with finding the circumpolar constellations in the sky. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                                incorporates that observation as the second stage of his poem. The Zodiac constellations form a distinct piece within the poem. 
                                The most significant point to draw from the context of the Lenten astronomy lectures is that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s catalogue 
                                may have attempted a sublime totality, an expression of religious awe.</p>
