                        While he does summon some epic conventions, in genre the work is topographical travel poem.</p>

Dearden</persName> from a transcript of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> and <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title> versions of the poem, which had been prepared at the behest of the editors of the 
                        <note type="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title></note>.</p>
                    
                    <p>The surviving physical evidence accords with <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x2019;s inscription in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSCVII">MS VII</title> that he started composition on <date when="1830-11-28">28 November 1830</date>. As <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName> remarks in his edition of the poem 
                        (<!-- DCH: bibliography ref -->, 23), <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> began composition with what became book 3, 
                        the 410&#x2010;line &#x201C;Ascent of <geogName corresp="#SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</geogName>,&#x201D; which he fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> and there dated <date when="1830-12-26">26 December 1830</date>. 
                        Another early dateable reference to &#x201C;The Ascent of <geogName corresp="#SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</geogName>&#x201D; occurs in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title> about late <date when="1830-12">December 1830</date>. 
                        The mention is found in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x2019;s handmade index to <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title> and presumably refers to the poem&#x02BC;s draft in that notebook, 
                        but the draft text is lost since the first half of the notebook was torn away (see <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title>: Description; and for dating of index entries, Contents and Discusssion).</p>
                    
                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drafted most of the poem in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title>, a notebook devoted exclusively to rough draft and no fair copy, 
                        with a small part of book 4 composed in the other major rough&#x2010;draft notebook, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x2019;s index to <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title> gives the identical page number for both the entry &#x201C;<geogName corresp="#SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</geogName>&#x201D; and the entry &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">Iteriad</title>,&#x201D; 
                        suggesting that he may have conceived of &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">Iteriad</title>&#x201D; only after completing &#x201C;<geogName corresp="#SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</geogName>&#x201D; and as an expansion of the shorter poem. 
                        His index also reveals that this draft followed a piece called &#x201C;Revolution,&#x201D; <!-- old no. 95 -->now lost.</p>
                    
                    <p>The composition can be traced with precision as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> gleefully reports to his father on the number of lines he has composed, 
                        toting up the farthings he will earn as payment, as <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> had agreed: 
                        &#x201C;as fast as I load you with mountain after mountain heaped gigantic I shall lighten you of your money  Hurra  Forty lines per day regularly as the sun goes down&#x201D;

Since the draft of book 1 in <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSVI">MS VI</title> contains 518 lines, the same as the fair copy, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x2019;s count indicates that, by <date when="1831-02-28">28 February</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> must have reached 
                        line 114 of book 2. (<persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> remarks a discrepancy between <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x2019;s count of the &#x201C;Ascent&#x201D; and book 3 of &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">Iteriad</title>,&#x201D; 
                        which he says contains 410 lines in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title> [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 226 n. 5].

                    <p>By <date when="1831-03-06">6 March</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> says he is &#x201C;in the fourth hundred of the second book cantering away to <placeName corresp="#BARROWDALE">Barrowdale</placeName> [i.e., <placeName corresp="#BORROWDALE">Borrowdale</placeName>] and <geogName corresp="#BOWDERSTONE">Bowder stone</geogName> and <geogName corresp="#BUTTERMERE">Buttermere</geogName>&#x201D; (<ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1831-03-06_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_jjr_1831-03-06">letter of <date when="1831-03-06"> 6 March 1831</date></title></ref> [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 233]). 
                        If he had in fact reached line 114 by the end of <date when="1831-02-28">28 February</date>, 400 lines of book 2 by <date when="1831-03-06">6 March</date> would put him about 40&#x2013;50 lines ahead of his scheduled 40 lines per day 
                        (or, if when writing on <date when="1831-02-28">28 February</date>, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> had not counted that day&#x2019;s production, he is precisely on schedule). 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x2019;s line&#x2010;count of <date when="1831-03-06">6 March</date> corresponds to draft that starts the extant portion of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title>&#x2014;namely, pp. 58&#x2013;74, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title>, which begins with line 176, book 1, 
                        and carries straight through to precisely line 400 of book 2 (see also no. 109<!--DCH: added ref tag for no. 109 - "to poesie"--> <ref type="apparatus" target="poesie_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRPOESIE">&#x201c;To Poesie&#x201d;</title></ref>, and part 1, <ref type="apparatus" target="msvi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title></ref>). In this draft, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> supplied marginal line numbers 
                        with every fifth line, and these lines correspond exactly to the numbered lines in <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName>&#x2019;s edition 
                        (based on <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x2019;s transcript of the fair copies <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MSS V</title>, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">VII</title>). 
                        Thus, with effortless facility, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drafted his couplets in the form and order they would appear in fair copy, 
                        with little appreciable revision, except for occasional changes in wording.</p>
                    
                    <p>After <date when="1831-03-06">6 March</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x2019;s &#x201C;cantering&#x201D; through draft is slowed to a halting walk. The draft in <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSVI">MS VI</title> (pp. 58&#x2013;74) carried through line 400, book 2, 
                        by about <date when="1831-03-06">6 March</date>, is followed immediately (pp. 75&#x2013;76) by <ref type="apparatus" target="poesie_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRPOESIE">&#x201c;To Poesie&#x201d;</title></ref> and <ref type="apparatus" target="to_the_wind_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTOTHEWIND">&#x201c;To the Wind&#x201d;</title></ref><!-- DCH: added witness titles -->, known to have been composed <date notBefore="1831-03-11" notAfter="1831-03-12">11&#x2013;12 March 1831</date>. 
                        These poems are succeeded (p. 76) by lines 401&#x2013;26, book 2, entitled by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> &#x201C;Continuation of second book of the <title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">Iteriad</title>.&#x201D; 
                        This passage, therefore, was composed after <date when="1831-03-12">12 March</date>. The upper limiting date of the passage is <date when="1831-03-21">21 March</date>, since it is followed (pp. 77&#x2013;78) by <ref type="apparatus" target="want_of_a_subject_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRWANTOFASUBJECT">&#x201c;On the Want of a Subject&#x201d;</title></ref>,

                    <p>Book 2 is resumed (and headed <title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title>) with lines 427&#x2013;538 on pp. 82&#x2013;84 of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title>; three&#x2010;quarters of the way through this passage, following line 504 (p. 83), 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> squeezed a date into the inner margin, &#x201C;(<date when="1831-04-22">22nd April 1831</date>),&#x201D; and lines 505ff. resume with a different pen. 
                        Thus, the month since the previous installment (lines 401&#x2013;26, composed between <date notBefore="1831-03-12" notAfter="1831-03-21">12 and 21 March</date>) had been devoted only to lines 427&#x2013;504,

                        (although the dating of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEDOCTORS">&#x201c;The Doctors&#x201d;</title> and 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSHAKESPEARESGRAVE">&#x201c;Shakespeare&#x02bc;s Grave&#x201d;</title> is somewhat doubtful). Lines 505&#x2013;38, which continue immediately after <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x2019;s <date when="1831-04-22">April 22</date> notation, 
                        were probably finished before the end of the month, since these lines precede draft (pp. 84&#x2013;85) of <ref type="apparatus" target="day_of_joy_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRDAYOFJOY">&#x201c;Day of Joy&#x201d;</title></ref>, a birthday ode for <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>, 
                        which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would have been preparing for <date when="1831-05-10">10 May 1831</date> presentation.</p>
                    
                    <p>Following the birthday ode, <ref type="apparatus" target="day_of_joy_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRDAYOFJOY">&#x201c;Day of Joy&#x201d;</title></ref> that ends on on p. 85, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> tore away two folios (pp. 86&#x2013;89). 
                        Since at least one of these missing folios, as can be inferred from the index to <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title>, probably contained draft of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title> 
                        (see <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title>, &#x201C;Description&#x201D;), at least some of those lines may have belonged to the subsequent portion of book 2 as fair&#x2010;copied&#x2014;lines 539&#x2013;658, 
                        which are nowhere else extant in draft. (Not all of this passage is likely to have fit on one missing folio, however, 
                        since only about 45 lines per page is typical for &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">Iteriad</title>&#x201D; in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title>. Of course, this draft passage could have been expanded in some other draft manuscript, now lost, 
                        prior to fair&#x2010;copying.) These missing draft lines would have been composed, therefore, either just before <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1831-05-10">10 May</date> birthday 
                        or sometime after that celebration. If composed after <date when="1831-05-10">May 10</date>, the family may by that time have been embarked on their <date notBefore="1831-05-01" notAfter="1831-06-30">May&#x2013;June journey of 1831</date> 
                        to the south and west of <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#WALES">Wales</placeName>. The lines could even have been delayed until the Ruskins returned from the holiday.</p>
                    
                    <p>The concluding lines of book 2, 659&#x2013;94 occur earlier in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title>, raising the possibility that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote them out of sequence; 
                        they are not numbered by <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName>, possibly because he had not yet composed the lines leading up to them. 
                        However, judging by their appearance in draft, I suspect the concluding lines were in fact composed in sequence 
                        but squeezed into available blank spaces remaining in the earlier section of the manuscript. The first such group of concluding lines (lines 659&#x2013;67) 
                        is entitled by <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> &#x201C;Conclusion of Book 2 <title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">Iteriad</title>&#x201D; and fills a brief space between <ref type="apparatus" target="the_doctors_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEDOCTORS">&#x201c;The Doctors&#x201d;</title></ref> and <ref type="apparatus" target="shakespeares_grave_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRSHAKESPEARESGRAVE">&#x201c;Shakespeare&#x02bc;s Grave&#x201d;</title></ref> on p. 79; 
                        it is written in an ink darker than the surrounding poems. The next passage, lines 668&#x2013;83, falls at the end of p. 80, following the first five&#x2010;line fragment of <ref type="apparatus" target="life_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRLIFE">&#x201c;Life&#x201d;</title></ref>. 
                        The final lines, 684&#x2013;94, are written (again in the darker ink) along the very bottoms of pp. 81, 82, and 83, 
                        beneath a heavy rule drawn across the lower margins of those pages. Were these concluding passages to be dated strictly by their sequential position, 
                        they would have been composed about <date notBefore="1831-03-21" notAfter="1831-04-30">21 March into April</date>; more likely, they were composed after <date when="1831-05">mid&#x2010;May</date>, at the earliest.</p>
                    
                    <p>Book 3 having already been composed, <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> moved from book 2 to book 4. The two missing folios (pp. 86&#x2013;89), which probably held draft of 2:539&#x2013;658 
                        or a portion of those lines, may also have held 4:1&#x2013;26, or some portion of that opening. It is just as likely, however, that book 4 was begun on some other manuscript, 
                        now lost. The first extant draft of book 4, labeled by <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">Iteriad</title> Book 4th,&#x201D; begins in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title> with line 27 and goes through 68, 
                        according to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x2019;s own line numbering. This passage begins on p. 88 (according to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x2019;s revised numbering system for <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title>; see <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title>, &#x201C;Description&#x201D;). 
                        Interrupted by the revision of <ref type="apparatus" target="death_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRDEATH">&#x201c;Death&#x201d;</title></ref>, another segment (labeled &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">Iteriad</title> Book 4th&#x201D;) takes up lines 69&#x2013;94 (p. 89). According to <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName> (ed., <title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">Iteriad</title>, p. 23), 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would have started on book 4 in <date when="1831-07">July</date>, following the <date notBefore="1831-05-01" notAfter="1831-06-30">May&#x2013;June</date> Welsh tour. It cannot be ascertained definitely whether this draft was begun during or following the tour; 
                        however, <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName> is probably correct, since the first extant lines of book 4 (lines 27&#x2013;68) follow <ref type="apparatus" target="melancholy_wont_away_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRMELANCHOLYWONTAWAY">&#x201c;Melancholy wont away&#x201d;</title></ref> and <ref type="apparatus" target="creation_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRCREATION">&#x201c;Creation&#x201d;</title></ref>, 
                        which can be assigned tentatively to <date notBefore="1831-08-01" notAfter="1831-08-14">early August</date>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Following 4:94 at the bottom of p. 89, another folio has been removed; but a remaining torn stub shows <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x2019;s marginal line number 95, 
                        revealing that the draft continued onto that missing page (which also held the lost <title type="poem" corresp="#JRDEARTEPOETICA">&#x201c;De Arte Poetica&#x201d;</title>). Hereafter, the composition of book 4 
                        in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title> becomes complex. Having torn away the folio with line 95, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> numbered the next extant folio in proper sequence, i.e., p. 90. 
                        The missing folio may have contained only five lines of book 4, lines 95&#x2013;100, since lines 101&#x2013;261 appear continuously on pp. 92&#x2013;96 
                        (or the missing folio may have contained the five lines plus some discarded version of lines 101ff.). The segment 101&#x2013;261 is interrupted on p. 96 by <ref type="apparatus" target="bed_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRBED">&#x201c;Bed&#x201d;</title></ref>, 
                        and followed by the single line 262 at the top of the next page (p. 97). After another interruption by <ref type="apparatus" target="eternal_hills_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRETERNALHILLS">&#x201c;The Eternal Hills&#x201d;</title></ref> and <ref type="apparatus" target="fun_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRFUN">&#x201c;Fun&#x201d;</title></ref> (p. 97), lines 263ff. start at the top of p. 98 
                        (headed &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">Iteriad</title>&#x201D;). For the first time, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x2019;s line numbering becomes faulty, since what should be (and eventually did become) line 263 is called in draft line 248; 
                        and this continues until what would become line 296 (here, 281). A simple explanation to this discrepancy can be found by looking back two pages to the bottom of p. 95, 
                        which ends with line 246&#x2014;lines 247&#x2013;61 being continued at the top of the next page, p. 96, before the draft of <ref type="apparatus" target="bed_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRBED">&#x201c;Bed&#x201d;</title></ref> (no. 133). 
                        When numbering the lines, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> must have overlooked the lines 247&#x2013;61 at the top of p. 96, and counted from line 246 at the bottom of p. 95, to the single line at the top of p. 97, 
                        and thus to the miscounted line &#x201c;248&#x201D; at the top of p. 98. (Another possibility is that lines 247&#x2013;61 were inserted later, but the single line at the top of p. 97 could not have been composed 
                        without those lines first being in existence, since it rhymes with line 261.) Later, when he reaches line 585 of the book 4 draft (p. 103, line 592 as presently numbered), 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> abruptly corrects this number to 600, very likely accounting for the dropped fifteen lines 247&#x2013;61. He may have discovered the error while fair&#x2010;copying; 
                        if so, the correction tells us that fair&#x2010;copying had begun, and was keeping good pace with the composition&#x2014;lagging only about 300 lines behind.</p>
                    
                    <p>Note that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x2019;s corrected numbering still does not correspond with the present, fair&#x2010;copy numbering; 
                        the difference is probably to be accounted for by an extra eight lines in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title>&#x2014;falling at points roughly between lines 320 and 350 of book 4 in the fair&#x2010;copy numbering&#x2014;that 
                        are deleted in pencil. When these lines were omitted in fair&#x2010;copying, the draft numbering would have come back into sync with the fair copy numbering. 
                        Since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x2019;s numbering in draft was not further corrected by the end of the poem&#x2014;which ends at line 704, instead of 696 as presently numbered&#x2014;his fair&#x2010;copying, 
                        if indeed started by now, must have lapsed during the composition of the second half of book 4.)</p>
                    
                    <p>In the misnumbered passage on p. 98, several lines (i.e., those called here 262&#x2013;69 and 272&#x2013;81; and, in fair copy, 277&#x2013;84 and 287&#x2013;96) are cited only by their first words, 
                        no doubt a shorthand for the for the full lines, elsewhere. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> must now be drafting &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">Iteriad</title>&#x201D; in another manuscript, as well as in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title>. 
                        Indeed, after line 281 (i.e., line 296 in fair copy), <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> directs himself to pick up &#x201C;From line 281 to line 305 in new Manuscript.&#x201D; 
                        These lines in the &#x201C;new Manuscript&#x201D; would have been 4:297&#x2013;320, according to fair&#x2010;copy numbering, and these lines are in fact to be found early in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, p. 3. 
                        <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, then, according to the approximate pace of &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">Iteriad</title>,&#x201D; was first put to use in about <date when="1831-09">September</date>, and this estimate accords with other evidence dating that manuscript 
                        (see <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>). Finally, rounding out p. 98 in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title>, what would become 4:321&#x2013;26 in fair copy (called lines 306&#x2013;13 here) is drafted at the bottom of the page, 
                        following the directive to the &#x201C;new Manuscript.&#x201D;</p>
                    
                    <p>The next two pages in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title> (99&#x2013;100r) continue the draft of 4:327&#x2013;82 (here called 314&#x2013;75) up to a note in the middle of 100r, &#x201C;FROM LINE 375 TO LINE 401 AT PAGE NINETY SIX&#x201D;; 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> is referring to a passage entitled &#x201C;Coming down upon Ambleside,&#x201D; which would become 4:383&#x2013;408 in fair copy, and which is drafted earlier in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title>, 
                        following <ref type="apparatus" target="with_those_it_does_not_signify_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRWITHTHOSEITDOESNOTSIGNIFY">&#x201c;With those it does not signify&#x201d;</title></ref> (pp. 90&#x2013;91). &#x201C;Coming down upon Ambleside&#x201D; may in fact have been drafted earlier, out of sequence: 
                        the passage has no marginal line numbers; and there appears no reason why, otherwise, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would have stopped midway on a page (100r), drafted a piece on pp. 90&#x2013;91, and then returned to p. 100r. 
                        As an earlier fragment, &#x201C;Coming down upon Ambleside&#x201D; might have been composed soon after 4:95&#x2013;100 and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRDEARTEPOETICA">&#x201c;De Arte Poetica&#x201d;</title>, which once appeared on a preceding folio, now missing. 
                        Note also that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> is still using his page numbering prior to the mutilation of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title> (i.e., &#x201C;PAGE NINETY SIX&#x201D; is now his p. 90).</p>
                    
                    <p>Returning to 100r, what we now know as 4:409ff. (402ff. here) resumes, and book 4 is composed to the end (lines 409&#x2013;696; here numbered as lines 402&#x2013;704; pp. 100r&#x2013;105). 
                        But <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote an additional passage entitled &#x201C;Conclusion of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">Iteriad</title>,&#x201D; which he did not fair&#x2010;copy. This is on p. 90, between <ref type="apparatus" target="with_those_it_does_not_signify_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRWITHTHOSEITDOESNOTSIGNIFY">&#x201c;With those it does not signify&#x201d;</title></ref> and &#x201C;Coming down upon Ambleside.&#x201D; 
                        It cannot be ascertained whether this &#x201C;Conclusion&#x201D; was penned earlier, at the same time as the &#x201C;Ambleside&#x201D; passage, or whether it was squeezed into this space after book 4 was completed. 
                        This conclusion reads as follows (edited version first published in <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 2:315 n. 3):
                        Farewell to each mountain and torrent and river
                        Farewell but it is not a farewell for ever

                        Though now I may bid thee a mournful farewell

                        From thy bosom thy beautiful bosom I flee
                        But yet thou hast graven thyself on my mind
                        And hast left the impression so deeply behind
                        That time has no power to destroy or erase
                        Nor one line of that picture atall [sic] to efface</p>
                    
                    <p>The author&#x02BC;s &#x201C;Notes&#x201D; are drafted on pp. 107&#x2013;8 of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title>. They must have been started after the poem was finished, 
                        since they commence on the first recto to follow the end of book 4, and it seems unlikely that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> could have predicted that his draft would end just here. 
                        The notes refer only to book 1, and they are scored through. Since no notes at all are fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSVII">MS VII</title>, 
                        this embellishment of the project was obviously abandoned. Indeed, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x2019;s <title type="letter" corresp="#jr_to_jjr_1832_01-14"><date when="1832-01-14">14 January 1832</date> letter</title>, 
                        in which he is &#x201C;cutting capers&#x201D; for having finished fair&#x2010;copying the poem, 
                        mentions that &#x201C;I have yet the notes to write&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 259). This identifies the notes as having been composed sometime after <date when="1832-01-14">January 14, 1832</date>, 
                        but a considerable time must have elapsed between the drafting of the poem&#x2019;s final lines and the composition of the notes. 
                        If <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was at about line 320 in <date when="1831-09">September 1831</date> (i.e., the passage in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>), surely he did not spend nearly four months composing the remaining 370 lines of book 4. 
                        The intervening time would have been devoted to fair&#x2010;copying, although, as suggested earlier, fair&#x2010;copying may have been keeping fair pace with composition, 
                        lagging only three or four hundred lines behind.</p>
