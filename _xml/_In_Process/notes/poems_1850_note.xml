                    <p>In <date when="1847-03">March 1847</date>, when <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> wrote to his friend, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="harrison_w_h_note.php"><persName corresp="#WHH">W. H. Harrison</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1792" notAfter="1878">1792&#x2013;1878</date>)</ref>, 
                        to affirm his intention to have a collection of his son&#x02BC;s poems printed, he referred to having &#x201C;had for a very long time a Volume of yours containing some light pieces of my son&#x201D;. 
                        In other words, before the <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1850"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (<date when="1850">1850</date>)</title> was realized, the family and friends 
                        produced and made use of compilations of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poems (<title type="letter" corresp="#jjr_to_whh_1847-03-08"><placeName corresp="#LEEDS">Leeds</placeName>, <date when="1847-03-08">8 March 1847</date></title>, in

H. Harrison</persName></title>, <date notBefore="1838" notAfter="1853">1838&#x2013;1853</date></ref>). 
                        The &#x201C;volume&#x201D; mentioned in this letter probably refers to a present from <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> for the holiday season of <date when="1844-12-25">Christmas 1844</date> and <date when="1845-01-01">New Year&#x02BC;s 1845</date>.</p>
                    
                    <p>On <date when="1845-01-04">4 January 1845</date>, while spending a disagreeably unseasonal holiday at the seaside with his family in <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> thanked <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> for the &#x201C;trouble you have taken to get me a Set of 
                        <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">JR</persName>. <title ref="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING">F.O</title> contributions&#x201D;, 
                        referring to <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> by the pen name he used for most of his contributions to annuals 
                        (<title type="letter" corresp="#jjr_to_whh_1845-01-04">letter</title>, in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMSL5"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMSL5"><persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> to <persName corresp="#WHH">W. H. Harrison</persName></title>, <date notBefore="1838" notAfter="1853">1838&#x2013;1853</date></ref>). 
                        The current location of this volume, if extant, is unknown, so its contents cannot now be determined. If limited, as <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> indicates, to contributions to 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php"><title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title></ref>, 
                        the choice was logical as a gift from the former editor (<date notBefore="1836" notAfter="1841">1836&#x2013;41</date>) of that annual&#x2014;and an editor 
                        who had grown particularly close to the Ruskin family during that tenure. Given the history of his relationship with the Ruskins, it seems no coincidence that the holiday season 
                        of <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>&#x02BC;s gift also marked the end of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s regular appearances in the holiday gift annual that had brought them together, 
                        <title ref="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>. After having contributed annually to the volumes for <date notBefore="1835" notAfter="1844">1835 through 1844</date>, 
                        in <date when="1845-01-01">New Year&#x02BC;s 1845</date> <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">J.R.</persName> apppeared instead in two annuals edited by <persName corresp="#MGBLESSINGTON">Lady Blessington</persName> for <orgName corresp="#LONGMAN">Longmans</orgName> 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#JJR1845REACTION"><persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s Reaction to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s Abandonment of a Poet&#x02BC;s Vocation</ref>.</p>
                    
      <p>Possibly the &#x201C;set&#x201D; of poems described by <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> in this letter was the same item as the collection of &#x201C;proofs of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s contributions 
          to <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>&#x201D; that, according to the editors of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>, 
          <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>&#x201C;bound up&#x201D; for <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> to carry &#x201C;on his tours&#x201C; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 2:xxxiv). So far, no provenance, description, or extant object can be connected 
                        with this statement, any more than with the &#x201C;volume&#x201D; in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s letter. If the same object, one can speculate that the volume would have been bound in a size convenient for transport, 
                        and it was also intended for ease of reference. As <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> commented later in the year to <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>, 
                        he was often frustrated by &#x201C;the Scatterment&#x201D; of his son&#x02BC;s poems published in annuals over several years; it was &#x201C;the Looking for the needle in the Bundle of Hay 
                        I dislike&#x2014;I know not how to have him or where to find him&#x201D;

      <p>Another compilation that may have anticipated <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s project of printing <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poems for private circulation in <date when="1850">1850</date> 
          was the bound holograph manuscript, <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="edmond_ms_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#EDMONDMS">&#x201C;<persName corresp="#JR">J. Ruskin </persName>&#x007C; Poems&#x201D; (n.d.), or &#x201C;Edmond manuscript&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                        This consists of transcriptions, in an unidentified hand, of poems by <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">J.R.</persName> published in <title ref="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>. 
                        As a holograph manuscript, it does not answer to the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>&#x02BC;s description of <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>&#x02BC;s 
          bound proofs. Another possible indication of a provenance disconnected from <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> is the omission of certain transcriptions&#x2014;for example, the poem 
          <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="remembrance_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRREMEMBRANCE">&#x201C;Remembrance&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
          which is not signed &#x201C;<persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">J.R.</persName>&#x201D; in <title ref="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</title>, but which <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> would have known to be <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s; and of poems that were published in another publication edited by <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> 
                        in <date when="1839">1839</date>, the <title type="periodical" corresp="#LONDONMONTHLYMISC"><hi rend="italic">London Monthly Miscellany</hi></title> 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 38:5).</p>
                    
                    <p>While the hand responsible for the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#EDMONDMS">&#x201C;Edmond manuscript&#x201D;</title> has not been identified, the physical item does make a good fit 
                        with circumstances mentioned by <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> in his <title type="letter" corresp="#jjr_to_whh_1847-03-08"><date when="1847-03-08">8 March 1847</date> letter</title> quoted above, in which 
                        <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> declares his intention to have <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poems printed. After thanking <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> for his &#x201C;volume&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> goes on: &#x201C;I have delayed having them [<persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;verses&#x201D;] penned because I want to get the best 
                        of all he has ever penned selected &#x0026; printed in good Type&#x201D;. The <hi rend="italic">penning</hi> clearly refers to a copyist&#x02BC;s work at the behest of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>, preliminary to publication. 
                        In <date when="1845">1845</date>, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> followed a similar procedure in having <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s letters from <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> copied, preparatory to publishing them as an epistolary travel narrative. As <persName corresp="#HIS">Harold Shapiro</persName> 
                        explains in his edition of the letters, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> &#x201C;carefully preserved them, of course, and put them in order. More than that, the originals are full of his markings. He numbered them, 
                        supplied missing dates and places in the headings, made notations on them for a copyist, underlined the passages to be copied, cancelled details to be omitted, and even inserted a word 
                        here and there&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RUSKININITALY"><persName corresp="#HIS">Shapiro</persName>, introduction to <title type="book" corresp="RUSKININITALY"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin in Italy</hi></title></ref>, xx). 
                        While no such editorial markings by <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> are evident in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#EDMONDMS">&#x201C;Edmond manuscript&#x201D;</title>, its very exacting transcriptions 
                        might represent a stage in the evolving plans toward a printed volume; and while the existence of this manuscript seems to conflict with <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s statement that he had &#x201C;delayed&#x201D; 
                        transcription of <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s poems, the manuscript may have been rejected as a false start, given <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s requirements in <date when="1847">1847</date>. As explained in the 
                        <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="edmond_ms_apparatus.php#DESCRIPTION">description</ref> of the manuscript, the transcriptions are not &#x201C;selected&#x201D;, 
                        as <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> now wanted&#x2014;starting, as they do, with <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="#SALTZBURG_apparatus.php">
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title></ref>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s first poem published in 
                        <title ref="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>, 
                        which was not ultimately chosen for inclusion in the <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1850">Poems (<date when="1850">1850</date>)</title>&#x2014;and the sequence of transcriptions is faulty, foundering on a mistake in transcription of the poems for 
                        <date when="1842">1842</date>. Nonetheless, regardless of whether this manuscript is related directly to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s project of printing the <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1850">Poems</title> in <date when="1850">1850</date>, 
                        the manuscript attests at the very least to the interest <date notAfter="1850">before 1850</date> in collecting <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poems scattered throughout published annuals.</p>

                    <p>A more worrying prospect to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> than the expense of holiday gifts, however, and a more emotional cause for collecting the poems for publication 
                        in <date when="1850">1850</date>, was the wrenching fact that the poems were becoming less important to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself. Already, <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        gift of the <date when="1845">1845</date> collection had apparently prompted some affectation of indifference by <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>, his father reporting that &#x201C;some in this House had no recollection 
                        of having before seen&#x201D; certain poems, although considerably connected with the Author&#x201D;

                        his first Continental tour without his parents&#x02BC; direct supervision, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> grew more outspoken about losing interest in verse composition. 
                        Although continuing to oblige his father by sending home new poems for publication, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> paraded his indifference and even contempt:

                        On his father&#x02BC;s birthday, he wrote less flippantly, but more decisively, explaining that his poetical impulse was dulled by a critical temper, which he regarded as superior: 
                    &#x201C;I almost always see two sides of a thing at once, now&#x2014;in matters poetical&#x2014;&#x0026; I never get strongly excited without perceiving drawbacks &#x0026; imperfections
