                <p>The aim of this note is not to attempt an exhaustive listing of books that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> read or consulted in his youth. 
                    Information about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s reading and its influences is available throughout <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, 
                    in the apparatuses and glosses of works that contain specific allusions to and borrowings from publications to which he was exposed. 
                    Especially influential authors and published sources, moreover, are discussed in notes of their own. 
                    This information can be accessed using the site&#x02bc;s search engine.</p>
                
                <p>The purpose of the present note is, rather, to centralize <ref type="internal" target="#RESOURCES">Resources</ref> for researching the Ruskin family reading, 
                    by extending and enhancing existing research sources. Included are <ref type="internal" target="#ANNUALLISTS">Lists of Annual Book Purchases by the Ruskin Family</ref>, 
                    and <ref type="internal" target="#DESCRIPTIONS">Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Youth</ref>. 
                    These resources build on the enumerative bibliographies compiled by <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName> in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">The Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref> 
                    (i.e., lists of annual book purchases drawn from <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book, RF MS 28, <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1845">1827&#x2013;45</date></title></ref>); 
                    and by <persName corresp="#JSD">James S. Dearden</persName> in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">The Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>. Those sources remain a starting point for all investigations of the Ruskin family reading. 
                    The resources are prefaced by some remarks, <ref type="internal" target="#RESEARCHING">On Researching <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s Reading in His Youth</ref>.</p>
                
                <div type="section" xml:id="RESEARCHING">
                    <head type="section">On Researching Ruskin&#x02bc;s Reading in His Youth</head>
                    
                    <p>Regarding the Ruskin family&#x02bc;s ownership or consultation of a given title at a given time, a measure of uncertainty will always be attached to 
                        documentable evidence of its presence in the family library&#x2014;or for that matter, to the absence of such evidence. 
                        For example, the fact that <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> purchased a book designed for youth does not necessarily mean it was intended for <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>; 
                        some purchases may have been intended as gifts for <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02bc;s cousin, especially for 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_mary_note.php"><persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName> (<date notBefore="1815" notAfter="1849">1815&#x2013;49</date>)</ref>, 
                        who lived with the Ruskin family from <date when="1828">1828</date> to her marriage in <date when="1848">1848</date>. While <persName corresp="#JSD">James S. Dearden</persName> comments about the family library that 
                        &#x201c;the books owned by all three Ruskins must be considered to be part of &#x2018;Ruskin&#x02bc;s Library&#x2019; because he ultimately inherited his parents&#x02bc; possessions, 
                        as well as having the use of them during their lifetimes&#x201d;, one wonders how far the availability, much less the inheritance, 
                        extended in the case of <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName>&#x02bc;s books. <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName> is right to conclude with the caveat that, 
                        &#x201c;although <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s lifetime&#x02bc;s library was much greater than it was at any <hi rend="italic">one</hi> time, 
                        we do not know its total extent&#x201d; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, xv, xxiv). The most valuable evidence that <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> can contribute to the question of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s reading lies 
                        in the edited texts, which can reveal lexical traces of readings that may have left no material trace in the family record.</p>
                    
                    <p>As <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName> remarks, in adulthood <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> &#x201c;was essentially . . . a book&#x2010;buyer rather than a book borrower or library user&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, xix), a habit that appears to have been inherited from his father, 
                        who was generous with books for his family&#x02bc;s education and entertainment. Still, there is no way of knowing 
                        whether publications that left their influence in the early manuscripts were borrowed or owned, 
                        if otherwise unrecorded as part of the family library in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</date>. For example, 
                        <persName corresp="#FDH">Felicia Hemans</persName> was sufficiently admired for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to have transcribed her poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#HEMANSSOUNDOFTHESEA">&#x201c;The Sound of the Sea&#x201d;</title> (<date when="1826">1826</date>) in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIVB">MS IVB</title>, 
                        probably based on the text as published in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#NEWMONTHLYMAGAZINE"><hi rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine</hi></title>. He also adapted passages from <persName corresp="#FDH">Hemans</persName>&#x02bc;s poem, 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#HEMANSRESTORATIONWORKSOFART">&#x201c;The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy&#x201d;</title>, published by <orgName corresp="#MURRAY">Murray</orgName> in <date when="1816">1816</date>, for use in his own poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201c;Saltzburg&#x201d;</title>. 
                        Yet <persName corresp="#FDH">Mrs. Hemans</persName> is curiously absent from records of the Ruskins&#x02bc; book ownership, 
                        apart from poems included in literary annuals that the Ruskins are known to have owned. 
                        How other publications by <persName corresp="#FDH">Hemans</persName> passed through their hands will probably remain a mystery.</p>
                    
                    <p>Borrowing could have provided the means for <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> to control what books entered the house. 
                        She appears to refer to borrowing, for example, when she writes to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> about the novel, 
                        <title type="book" corresp="#BROOKEFOOLOFQUALITY"><hi rend="italic">The Fool of Quality</hi></title> (<date notBefore="1766" notAfter="1772">1766&#x2013;72</date>) by <persName corresp="#HBROOKE">Henry Brooke</persName> (<date notBefore="1703" notAfter="1783">1703&#x2013;83</date>). Since she &#x201c;did not like&#x201d; the novel, 
                        she &#x201c;got the first volume merely to read the History of the three little fishes to <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x201d;. 
                        In this instance, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02bc;s renewed encounter with the novel led to &#x201c;the Almighty open[ing] the understanding&#x201d;, 
                        and she decided to &#x201c;read it together&#x201d; with <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>. Perhaps only then was the full work acquired for the household, 
                        perhaps in the abridgement of the novel by <persName corresp="#JWESLEY">John Wesley</persName> 
                        (<ref type="apparatus" target="mr_to_jjr_1826-05-15_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="#mr_to_jjr_1826-05-15">Margaret to John James Ruskin, 15 May 1826</title></ref>, <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref> 145; <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">The Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, 51 [no. 336];

                    <p>On travels, the Ruskins supplemented books they brought with them by tapping resources along the way; for example, 
                        during the tour of <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName> in <date when="1833">1833</date>, when <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> fell ill, his father and cousin <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> cheered him up by finding 
                        &#x201c;some English books from a library&#x201d; along with &#x201c;2 or 3 volumes of <title type="periodical" corresp="#GALIGNANISMAGAZINE">Gagliani&#x02bc;s Magazine</title><!--Galignani misspelled - typo or written this way in Mary's diary?-->&#x201d;&#x2014;that is, 
                        one of the periodicals issued by <orgName corresp="#GALIGNANI">Librairie Galignani</orgName>, the Paris&#x2010;based English&#x2010;language publisher, bookseller, and circulating library, 
                        which published two monthly journals, the <title type="periodical" corresp="#REPERTORY"><hi rend="italic">Repertory</hi></title> (ca. <date notBefore="1807" notAfter="1825">1807&#x2013;25</date>), and 
                        <title type="periodical" corresp="#GALIGNANISMAGAZINE"><hi rend="italic">Galignani&#x02bc;s Monthly Review and Magazine</hi></title> (ca. <date notBefore="1822" notAfter="1825">1822&#x2013;25</date>), 
                        as well as a daily, the <title type="periodical" corresp="#MESSENGER"><hi rend="italic">Messenger</hi></title> (ca. <date notBefore="1814" notAfter="1904">1814&#x2013;1904</date>). 
                        <orgName corresp="#GALIGNANI">Galignani</orgName> also published a series, <title type="series" corresp="#STANDARDMODERNNOVELS"><hi rend="italic">Standard Modern Novels and Romances</hi></title>, 
                        which supplied English travelers and expatriates with contemporary British poetry and prose. 
                        The editions were issued in duodecimo, a size convenient for travel, but printed using excellent type and engravings, 
                        and edited for correct and complete text&#x2014;in some cases, text more complete and reliable than what could be found in London editions<!--particular publishing company or placename?-->. 
                        As piracies, the volumes were priced significantly cheaper than corresponding London editions, 
                        and sold in paper&#x2010;covered boards&#x2014;volumes that could be shared among travelers at a hotel and left behind for others&#x02bc; enjoyment. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did retain from boyhood one of <orgName corresp="#GALIGNANI">Galignani</orgName>&#x02bc;s outstanding volumes in the series 
                        (possibly obtained from a <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> seller rather than from abroad)&#x2014;<title type="book" corresp="#POETICALWORKSETAL"><hi rend="italic">The Complete Poetical Works of Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats</hi></title> (<date when="1829">1829</date>), 
                        an edition that, at the time of publication, was superior to any British edition of <persName corresp="#PBS">Percy Shelley</persName>, 
                        and the only edition of <persName corresp="#JKEATS">Keats</persName> available in collected form 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48"><title type="transcript" corresp="#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</title></ref>, 106; 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BARBERGALIGNANI"><persName corresp="#GBARBER">Barber</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#BARBERGALIGNANI">&#x201c;Galignani&#x02bc;s and the Publication of English Books in France&#x201d;</title></ref>, 269, 284, 272&#x2013;74;
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">The Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, 76 [no. 556]).</p>
                    
                    <p>Besides the possibility that books were borrowed, another kind of caveat should be applied to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s retrospective accounts of his boyhood reading. 
                        The authors and titles he mentions in the opening chapters of <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> are not untrue to his early reading, 
                        but his account of how both loving and resisting certain books has charmed readers 
                        into fixating on a short list of titles that is potentially misleading. First, the list is highly selective&#x2014;contrasting, 
                        for dramatic effect, the enforced Sunday reading of <persName corresp="#JBUNYAN">John Bunyan</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="book" corresp="#BUNYANPILGRIMSPROGRESS"><hi rend="italic">Pilgrim&#x02bc;s Progress</hi></title> and <persName corresp="#DDEFOE">Daniel Defoe</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="book" corresp="#DEFOEROBINSONCRUSOE"><hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe</hi></title> 
                        with weekday &#x201c;reading of my own election&#x201d; of <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s novels and <persName corresp="#HOMER">Homer</persName> (<persName corresp="#APOPE">Alexander Pope</persName>&#x02bc;s translation of the <title type="poem" corresp="#ILIAD">&#x201c;Iliad&#x201d;</title>)&#x2014;but 
                        the <ref type="internal" target="#DESCRIPTIONS">Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Youth</ref> shows how these 
                        classics were mixed with works, both secular and Sabbatarian, that now seem much more ephemeral. Second, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s retrospection 
                        flattens these readings in time, suggesting that his study even of favored works was both simultaneous and compartmentalized. 
                        <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> along with the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref> shows that the Ruskins, no less than other middle&#x2010;class families, attempted to follow 
                        the program of graduated, age&#x2010;appropriate reading for children as recommended by educationists like the Barbaulds and Edgeworths. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s writings in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> also reflect his tendency, however, to buck the program, by reading texts above his years 
                        (e.g., <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="book" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></title>, which he copied verbatim in <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201c;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I&#x201d;</title>, but which are too advanced for that context).

                        (e.g., the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WHITELADY">White Lady</persName> as a protector of <orgName corresp="#PROTESTANTISM">Protestanism</orgName> in <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY"><hi rend="italic">The Monastery</hi></title>) than the Sunday sermons he attempted to copy.</p>

                    <p>In <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">The Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName> transcribes <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s brief notations of authors and/or titles that he 
                        purchased each month of every year, from <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1845">1827 through 1845</date>, in his <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref>. In the ledger, 
                        book purchases are included among many other miscellaneous items on the pages devoted to &#x201c;Sundries&#x201d; for each year. 
                        Because <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> notes the amounts spent, <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> is able in many cases to identify the authors/titles 
                        with specific editions available at the time from publishers at those prices. <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>&#x02bc;s transcriptions and annotations are very reliable, 
                        but should nonetheless be revisited and compared against the manuscript of the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref>, 
                        since <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s entries are sometimes ambiguous. Where appropriate, original entries in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref> are referenced throughout <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>. 
                        Here, for convenience of reference, are listed the page numbers in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref> of <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>&#x02bc;s transcribed lists, 
                        along with the corresponding pages of &#x201c;Sundries&#x201d; in the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref>. Here also are expansions and suggested corrections of <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>&#x02bc;s lists.</p>
                        
                    <p><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> omitted one year of sundry book purchases, those for <date when="1830">1830</date>, from <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 
                        presumably because no letters are extant from that year, thus giving no occasion for annotation. 
                        <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName> has incorporated the <date when="1830">1830</date> purchases into the alphabetized entries in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">The Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>; however, 
                        since <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s book lists organized chronologically by year form a helpful comparison 
                        with the discussions of dating works and manuscripts in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, the <date when="1830">1830</date> book list is compiled in its entirety, 
                        cross&#x2010;referenced with entries in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">The Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>. This list and others from <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1845">1827&#x2013;45</date> will be updated 
                        as new information comes to light. More speculatively, annual lists are also compiled 
                        for years prior to the start of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref> in <date when="1827">1827</date>. These identifications are ongoing.</p>
                    
                    <p>Some names are transcribed from <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s &#x201c;Sundries&#x201d; that may or may not refer to books or authors. 
                        <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> often listed names of vendors as shorthand for the wares they supplied, 
                        as well as naming recipients of gifts or purchases. In many cases, it is mere speculation whether a proper name 
                        refers to purchase of a book or of some other kind of item, and these names are flagged as &#x201c;unidentified&#x201d;. 
                        Yet the occurence of some names can sometimes be aligned with other information to identify book titles and authors 
                        at least tentatively. Again, these identifications are ongoing.</p>

                                    The responsibility for and circumstances of binding these three items as &#x201c;Fairy Tales&#x201d; are unknown. 
                                    This title on the spine applies most legitimately to the first of the items, <title type="anthology" corresp="#MOTHERBUNCHSFAIRYTALES"><hi rend="italic">Mother Bunch&#x02bc;s Fairy Tales</hi></title>, 
                                    whereas the other two items belong only marginally, each containing just one or two stories that feature a fairy or fantastical events. 
                                    Regardless of the consistency of the collection, however, an implicit rationale becomes apparent by comparing the contents of another bound collection,

                                    &#x201c;a certain trimness (primness one might almost call it) in the covers, the quality of the paper used, 
                                    the excellent type&#x2010;face, the occasional use of coloured inks for text and illustrations, 
                                    usually bistre or sanguine, occasionally green, and a few hand&#x2010;coloured illustrations&#x201d;. 
                                    In their own time, however, the books were apparently little known outside of <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>; 
                                    and even in their own country, they were not widely popular, because their prices were considered 
                                    rather dear, even at two pence or six pence per copy&#x2014;cheaper and less elegant chapbooks by this publisher

                                            As pointed out in the &#x201c;Introductory Essay&#x201d; on the copy in the <title type="archive" corresp="#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALESHOCKLIFFE">Hockliffe Archive</title>, 
                                            the tales have no connection with Christmas, despite the anthology&#x02bc;s title, which presumably was a marketing ploy. 
                                            The text, which in some copies includes a description of the Seven Wonders of the World, 
                                            was apparently based on a collection first published in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, ca. <date when="1780">1780</date>

                                            The first story in the collection opens with commentary on the neglect of religion and morality in childhood education, 
                                            but the stories in themselves do little to redress this supposed failing. The collection is miscellaneous, 
                                            some tales teaching prudent and moral conduct, some adopting an oriental flavor, and only a few entailing magic or fairies. 
                                            Two of the latter sort feature dervises (i.e., dervishes), who reward hospitality with magical riches, but retract the reward and punish 
                                            characters who overstep boundaries owing to greed or excess curiosity.<lb/><lb/>

                                    respectively 14 [no. 77], 12 [no. 67], 13 [no, 70], 13 [no. 69], 227 [no. 1775], 345 [no. 2736], 315 [no 2475], 23 [no. 151]. 
                                    The responsibility for binding these items together is unknown. A rationale, if not the specific occasion for the collection 
                                    can be inferred, however, if the binding of these eight items was made in concert with the binding of <ref type="internal" target="#FAIRYTALESDISCUSSION">Fairy Tales</ref>. 
                                    As compared with the latter, the items collected here share an emphasis on "cautionary" tales (to draw on the subtitle of The Cowslip). 
                                    Since the early nineteenth century, such Romantic writers as Charles Lamb, S. T. Coleridge, and William Wordsworth 
                                    had polemically argued in favor of appealing to children's imagination with fairy tales as opposed to training their reason and morals 
                                    with "instructive" and "cautionary" tales and dialogues by the "cursed Barbauld Crew", as Lamb anathematized this group largely of women writers. 
                                    In our time, critics have exposed the politics underpinning these divisions, but in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, 
                                    which was probably when a number of Ruskin's childhood books were divided between these two collections, the reputation of 
                                    Anna Laetitia Barbauld had been disassociated from her politics and reduced to bland high-mindedness--a "valuation" 
                                    of this writing that suggests, as William McCarthy complains, "that it entirely lacked humor, irony, or wit" 
                                    (McCarthy, &#x201C;&#x2018;A High&#x2010;Minded Christian Lady&#x2019;&#x201D;, 179; and see 
                                    Clarke, &#x201C;&#x2018;The Cursed Barbauld Crew&#x2019;&#x201D;, 91-93). 
                                    Such a valuation was perhaps implicitly placed on these eight items by binding them together.<lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    The reductive valuation would not have been Ruskin's, but it seems unlikely that he could have been responsible for binding this collection 
                                    since, as noted in the following descritions, he annotated some of the items separately, 
                                    bequeathing them to Joan Severn and her children. One of the annotations is dated "1889", and another "1889-1890", 
                                    clues that the binding was ordered after 1890 by someone other than Ruskin--perhaps by Joan Severn--since by that time, 
                                    Ruskin himself would not have been in a mental state to take such an initiative.

                                            The Ruskins regularly traveled to Perth, until John's Aunt Jessie died in 1828.
                                            By the time of her death, Jessie had lost six of her ten children, two of whom were especially dear as companions 
                                            to Ruskin in his childhood--James, who lived with the Ruskins at Herne Hill after his father's death, 
                                            and who himself died in 1826; and Jessie, who died in 1827. The four surviving children--three sons 
                                            and the daughter, Mary, who lived with the Ruskins until her marriage--were 
                                            generously supported by John James. Just so, in The Widow of Roseneath, the successful son is supported 
                                            in America by his uncle, a kindly and prudent merchant. The book might even have been shared between 
                                            John and his cousins living at Herne Hill who depended on John James's charity.

                                            Moon, John Harris's Books for Youth, 129 (no. 932 [7]). 
                                            The "more cautionary stories" constituting The Cowslip were first published by Harris in 1811, following the 
                                            "cautionary stories in verse adapted to the ideas of children from four to eight years old" constituting 
                                            The Daisy, first published in 1807. The Daisy was originally "illustrated with thirty engravings on copper-plate", 
                                            but The Cowslip was illustrated with thirty woodcuts, which formed headpieces to the poems 
                                            (Moon, John Harris's Books for Youth, 129 [nos. 933 (1), 932 (1)]).<lb/><lb/>
                                            
                                            In Ruskin's copy, the signature was written by his father, as Ruskin notes in a later hand, perhaps because he was too young to have 
                                            signed the copy for himself when first presented with the book. The primitiveness of drawings scattered throughout the book 
                                            suggest a very early age. In a later hand, it appears that Ruskin re-dedicated the book to "My Joanna, and her children" on "New Years Day. 1889". 
                                            Later, he wrote "Deeper and deeper still. / 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> April 1889-1890"; also a date, "<hi rend="underline">1822</hi>" underlined,
