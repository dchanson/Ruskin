                <head type="title">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth</head>
                <p>The aim of this note is not to attempt an exhaustive listing of books that Ruskin read or consulted in his youth. 
                    Throughout ERM, information about the influences of Ruskin's reading is available 
                    in the apparatuses and glosses of works that contain specific allusions to and borrowings from publications to which he was exposed. 
                    Moreover, especially influential authors and published sources are discussed in notes of their own. 
                    This information may be searched by keyword, and relevant biographical and contextual notes are also linked below. 
                    The purpose of the present note, rather, is to centralize various information nowhere else referenced in the archive, 
                    particularly information about material features and marginalia of books that survive 
                    allegedly from the Ruskin family library. (Provenance is not certain in all cases.) Such features are too detailed to have been included 
                    in the enumerative bibliographies compiled by Van Akin Burd (i.e., his transcriptions in Ruskin Family Letters of annual book purchases noted in 
                    John James Ruskin's Account Book, RF MS 28, 1827&#x2013;45); 
                    and by James S. Dearden (The Library of John Ruskin). Those sources remain a starting point for all investigations of the Ruskin family reading.</p>
                
                <div type="section">
                    <head type="section">Researching Ruskin's Reading</head>
                    
                    <p>Regarding the Ruskin family's ownership or consultation of a given title at a given time, of course only so much can be inferred from 
                        documentable evidence of its presence in the family library--or for that matter, from the absence of such evidence. 
                        For example, some of John James's purchases of books designed for youths may have been meant less for John than for his cousin, 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_mary_note.php"><persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName> (1815&#x2013;49)</ref>, 
                        who lived with the Ruskin family from 1828 to her marriage in 1848. While Dearden comments about the family library, 
                        "the books owned by all three Ruskins must be considered to be part of 'Ruskin's Library' because he ultimately inherited his parents' possessions, 
                        as well as having the use of them during their lifetimes", that availability for use, much less the inheritance, 
                        may or may not have included Mary Richardson's books. Dearden is right to conclude with a caveat that, 
                        "although Ruskin's lifetime's library was much greater than it was at any <hi rend="italic">one</hi> time, 
                        we do not know its total extent" (Library of John Ruskin, xv, xxiv). ERM is occasionally able to extend the known scope of the Ruskin library, or at least the Ruskins' known acquaintance with certain books, 
                        by pointing to the probable influence of publications that may otherwise have left no material trace in the family record.</p>
                    
                    <p>Dearden's view is well taken, too, that in adulthood Ruskin "was essentially . . . a book-buyer rather than a book borrower or library user" 
                        (Library of John Ruskin, xix). Ruskin seems to have inherited this habit from his father, 
                        who was generous with books for his family's education and entertainment. The possibility of borrowing cannot be dismissed, however. 
                        On travels, the Ruskins supplemented books they brought with them by tapping resources along the way, 
                        such as the tour of Switzerland in 1833, when John James and Mary Richardson cheered up John, who had taken ill, 
                        by finding him "some English books from a library" along with "2 or 3 volumes of Gagliani's Magazine" 
                        (i.e., probably one of the periodicals issued by Librairie Galignani, 
                        the Paris-based English-language publisher, bookseller, and circulating library, which published a monthly, 
                        the Repertory of English Literature [begun 1808], and a daily, Gaglinani's Messenger [begun 1814])
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48"><title type="transcript" corresp="#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</title></ref>, 106). 
                        At home, Margaret Ruskin was watchful over what books entered the house, particularly during John's youth, 
                        and it is possible that borrowing formed part of her scheme for surveillance. For example, she appears to refer to borrowing 
                        when she writes to Jahn James about the novel, The Fool of Quality (1766-72) by Henry Brooke (1703-83): 
                        she "got the first volume merely to read the History of the three little fishes to John", since she otherwise "did not like" the book 
                        (Margaret to John James Ruskin, 15 May 1826, RFL 145). (In this case, "the Almighty open[ed] the understanding" in her renewed encounter with the novel, 
                        committing her to "read it together" with John James, perhaps in John Wesley's abridgement of the novel.)</p>
                    <p>For books that can be detected through lexical traces in the early manuscripts, but that are otherwise unrecorded as part of the physical Ruskin family library, 
                        it is of course impossible to know whether such a volume was owned or borrowed. An example is Felicia Hemans's 
                        ...., which, because of the portion of the text incorporated into Ruskin's poem, Saltzburg, 
                        must have originated in the revised edition of Hemans's poem published by .... 
                        (see "Saltzburg").
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>A caveat should also be applied to Ruskin's own account of his boyhood reading in Praeterita. 
                        While the authors and titles he identifies are not untrue to his early reading, his account of reading that was both beloved and resisted has charmed readers 
                        into fixating on a short list of titles that is potentially misleading. The selectiveness 
                        of the list--for example, the specific contrast of enforced Sunday reading of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress and Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe 
                        with weekday "reading of my own election" of Walter Scott's novels and Homer (Alexander Pope's translation of the Iliad)--is 
                        well calculated to establish the autobiography's gently comic, ironic tone, but also lends a retrospective aura to these books. 
                        The problem is not just that, for the sake of irony, Ruskin is highly selective in the books he treats as influential; 
                        the foreshortening of the narrative also gives the impression that Ruskin's study of these books was both simultaneous and compartmentalized. 
                        While it is true that Sabbatarianism had the effect of compartmentalizing family reading, an effect of random simultaneity 
                        in the consumption of books was controlled to an extent by educationists like the Barbaulds and Edgeworths, 
                        who persuaded countless early Victorian parents to follow a graduated program of age-appropriate reading for their children. 
                        But even given these broad cultural influences over programs of childhood reading, one must still take account of Ruskin's 
                        sometimes eccentric and resistant response to the program. The early manuscripts and the family letters reveal that he did not always restrict himself 
                        to age-appropriate reading (Joyce's Scientific Dialogues, which he copied verbatim in Harry and Lucy, Vol. 1, 
                        was far beyond his seven years); and religious influence was as powerful in some weekday reading 
                        (Walter Scott's The Monastery), while Sunday services led by Ruskin's tutor, the Reverend Edward Andrews, 
                        were far from devoid of sophisticated secular culture.</p>

                    <p>In Library of John Ruskin, Dearden helpfully annotates his entries with provenance and other information; 
                        and in Ruskin Family Letters, Burd connects John James's brief notations of authors/titles and amounts spent 
                        with editions that were available at the time from publishers at those prices. Burd's transcriptions should nonetheless 
                        be compared against the manuscript of the Account Book, since John James's entries are sometimes ambiguous, 
                        warranting additional scrutiny. Where appropriate, the Account Book is referenced throughout ERM. 
                        Here below, for convenience of reference, are listed the page numbers of Burd's transcriptions of book lists, 
                        along with the corresponding pages of John James's lists of "Sundries" in the Account Book, 
                        which is how he caregorized books along with other non-perishable household items, subdivided by month (and often even days) of purchase.</p>
                    
                    <p>In addition to page numbers, this list also gathers information that has escaped attention elsewhere. 
                        One year of sundry book purchases, those for 1830, was omitted by Burd in Ruskin Family Letters, 
                        presumably because no letters are extant from that year, thus giving no occasion for annotation. 
                        Dearden has incorporated the 1830 purchases into the alphabetized entries in The Library of John Ruskin, 
                        but since book lists organized chronologically by year, as in Ruskin Family Letters, can form a helpful comparison 
                        with the discussions of dating works and manuscripts in ERM, John James's 1830 book list is compiled in its entirety, 
                        cross-referenced with entries in Dearden. For this and other years, if new information comes to light about John James's 
                        book listings in "Sundries", it is folded into the list. These identifications are ongoing.</p>
                        
                        <p>Some names are transcribed below from John James's "Sundries" that may or may not refer to books or authors. 
                            John James often listed names of vendors as shorthand for the wares they supplied, 
                            as well as naming recipients of gifts or purchases; in many of these cases, it is mere speculation whether a name 
                            refers to purchase of a book or of some other kind of item. Yet the occurence of some names can sometimes be aligned with other information 
                            to identify at least tentatively book titles and authors otherwise associated with the early Ruskin family library. 
                            These names are noted as "unidentified" along with salient information. Again, these identifications are ongoing.</p>

                                    The responsibility for and circumstances of binding the three items together as "Fairy Tales" are unknown. 
                                    Two of three anthologies can be considered fairy-tale collections only marginally, containing just one or two such stories.<lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    What the three items most notably have in common is their publication by J. Lumsden and Son of Glasgow. 
                                    Now highly regarded among collectors, Lumsden's children's books are distinguished by 
                                    "a certain trimness (primness one might almost call it) in the covers, the quality of the paper used, 
                                    the excellent type-face, the occasional use of coloured inks for text and illustrations, 
                                    usually bistre or sanguine, occasionally green, and a few hand-coloured illustrations". 
                                    In their own time, however, the books were apparently little known outside of Scotland; 
                                    and even in their own country, they were not widely popular, because their prices were considered 
                                    rather dear, even at two pence and six pence (Roscoe and Brimmell, James Lumsden and Son of Glasgow, xi, xiii)
                                    <lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    The firm produced children's books ca. 1790-1850, but seldom printed dates on title pages 
                                    (Roscoe and Brimmell, James Lumsden and Son of Glasgow, xv). The copies bound here are all undated. 
                                    Dearden, without explanation, dates them tentatively as 1814, which is the lower limit suggested by Roscoe and Brimmell's descriptions below.

                                            As pointed out in the "Introductory Essay" on the copy in the Hockliffe Archive, 
                                            the tales have no connection with Christmas, despite the anthology's title, which presumably was a marketing ploy 
                                            The text, which in some copies includes a description of the Seven Wonders of the World, 
                                            was apparently based on a collection first published in London, ca. 1780 
                                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALESHOCKLIFFE"><title type="archive" corresp="#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALESHOCKLIFFE">&#x201C;Stories before 1850. 0220: Anon.

                                            The first story in the collection opens with commentary on the neglect of religion and morality in childhood education, 
                                            but the stories in themselves do little to redress this supposed failing. The collection is miscellaneous, 
                                            some tales teaching prudent and moral conduct, some adopting an oriental flavor, and only a few entailing magic or fairies. 
                                            Two of the latter sort feature dervises (i.e., dervishes), who reward hospitality with magical riches, but retract the reward and punish 
                                            characters who overstep boundaries owing to greed or excess curiosity.<lb/><lb/>
                                            
                                            The frontispiece contains an emblem of a child choosing between folly and wisdom, 
                                            which may have contributed to Ruskin's own use of visual emblems, such as

                                            The collection consists of moral tales enjoining contentment with one's lot, prudence, and trust in God's providence. 
                                            (Roscoe and Brimmell remark that "The Two Sisters" is not the story of that title by Mrs. Sherwood.)
                                            Only "The King and Fairy Ring" qualifies as a fairy story.</item>

                                        <item><hi rend="italic">Discussion:</hi> The tale relates the fate of a Scottish widow who, reduced in circumstances by the death of her husband, 
                                            must part with her two sons. One son emigrates to America and prospers, and the other son resorts to crime. 
                                            As "A Lesson of Piety Affectionately Dedicated to the Young", the tale may well have been acquired at some point 
                                            for John to contemplate the consequences of the death of his <!-- LINK NOTES THROUGHOUT-->Uncle Patrick in Perth, Scotland, in 1824, 
                                            and its effect on his wife and cousins. The Ruskins regularly traveled to Perth, until John's Aunt Jessie died in 1828.
                                            By the time of her death, Jessie had lost six of her ten children, two of whom were especially dear as companion cousins 
                                            to Ruskin in his childhood--James, who lived with the Ruskins at Herne Hill after his father's death, 
                                            and who himself died in 1826; and Jessie, who died in 1827. The four surviving children--three sons 
                                            and the daughter, Mary, who lived with the Ruskins from her mother's death until her marriage--were 
                                            generously supported by John James. Just so, in The Widow of Roseneath, the successful son is supported 
                                            in America by his uncle, a kindly and prudent merchant. The book might even have been shared between 
                                            John and his cousins living at Herne Hill who depended on John James's charity. 
                                            For a plot summary of the tale and brief commentary from an 1823 review, see

                <p>A copy with a Brantwood bookplate now at the Beinecke Library, Yale University,
                    New Haven, Conn., may survive from Ruskin boyhood: <hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home; / or the /
                        Juvenile Budget Opened. / consisting of / a Variety of Miscellaneous Pieces /
                        for the / Instruction and Amusement / of / Young Persons / by Dr. Aiken and Mrs.
                        Barbauld / London / Printed and Published by J. F. Dove, / St. John Square.</hi></p>
                <p>The copy contains marginalia in Ruskin&#x02BC;s mature hand, especially the
                    pages containing the twenty&#x2010;first evening, which is connected with mineralogy
                    (Viljoen, Ruskin&#x02BC;s Backgrounds 8). Scrawls on the front endpaper may
                    be Ruskin&#x02BC;s from childhood: one of these scrawls Helen Gill Viljoen
                    read as a &#x201C;J&#x201D;, and she declared this to be Ruskin&#x02BC;s earliest extant
                    signature (where does she say so? not in Backgrounds where she assigns earliest
                    signature to Frank&#x2014;maybe she thought better of it Correction needed here?).</p>

                <p> A copy owned by Ruskin with a Brantwood bookplate was acquired by Sharp
                    (Viljoen, Ruskin&#x02BC; Backgrounds, 7). Sharp gave his collection to Helen Gill
                    Viljoen, who in turn, in dividing her collection between libraries, gave the
                    Ruskin books in her possession to the Beinecke Library, Yale
                    University, New Haven, Conn., where this copy of &#x201C;Harry and Lucy Concluded&#x201D;
                    remains.</p>
                <p>The copy is a first (1825) edition Entry needed here.</p>
                <p>It is unclear whether this copy is the one that Ruskin used in childhood. The
                    binding is tight and the pages clean, as compared with Ruskin&#x02BC;s
                    boyhood copy of Edgeworth, Frank, which Entry needed here and which contains marginalia in
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s boyhood as well as mature hands. All Correction needed here? the marginalia in
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s &#x201C;Harry and Lucy Concluded&#x201D; is in Ruskin&#x02BC;s mature
                    hand; however, a crude geometrical drawing on the back endpaper of volume 4 may
                    date from boyhood Correction needed here?.</p>

                <p>A copy owned by Ruskin with a Brantwood bookplate was acquired by Sharp (Viljoen,
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s Backgrounds, 6). Sharp gave his collection to Helen Gill Viljoen, who in
                    turn, in dividing her collection between libraries, gave the Ruskin
                    books in her possession to the Beinecke Library, Yale University, New Haven,
                    Conn., where this copy of <hi rend="italic">Frank</hi> remains.</p>
                <p>The copy is a first (1822) edition in three volumes Entry needed here.</p>
                <p>The volumes, which have had heavy use Entry needed here, contain marginalia in the hand
                    of one of his parents and in Ruskin&#x02BC;s&#x2014;both his boyhood
                    and mature hands. The first volume has an inscription, &#x201C;John
                    Ruskin,&#x201D; on the first flyleaf (recto), which Viljoen identifies as
                    the hand of John James Ruskin; then, on a blank page which follows [i.e., the
                    second flyleaf, recto], [is] Ruskin&#x02BC;s earliest known signature Correction needed here?, a
                    pencilled one Ruskin apparently copied, in a most childish scrawl, from the name
                    as written in ink by his Father (ibid.). Entry needed here
                    Whether this is indeed Ruskin earliest extant signature cannot be determined,
                    but the cursive script, which Ruskin did not generally adopt before Entry needed here, is
                    indeed very labored.</p>
                <p>The endpapers (Entry needed here) of volume 1 also contain Frank drawing, untitled no. 1,
                    and Frank drawing, untitled no. 2.</p>
