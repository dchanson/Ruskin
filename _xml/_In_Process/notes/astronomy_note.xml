                <p>Between <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1828">1826 and 1828</date>, astronomy featured prominently in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poetry and prose, 
                    from his first mention of the typical beginner&#x02BC;s constellation for British children, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name>, 
                    in the <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1827">1826/27</date> poem,

                    to his cataloguing of constellation names from all around the celestial globe in the <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1828">1827/28</date> poem,

                    to the task of memorizing constellation names and their respective numbers of stars, which is assigned to his character <persName corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> in the <date notBefore="1828" notAfter="1829">1828/29</date> dialogue,

                    to his Miltonic hymn of praise to the sun in the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="new_years_poems_note.php">New Year&#x02BC;s poem</ref> for <date when="1828-01-01">January 1828</date>,

                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> composed these works in context of rising popular education in astronomy for adults and children 
                    in the <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1839">first three decades of the nineteenth century</date> in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>. 
                    On the evidence of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s writing about astronomy, he was engaged more by the poetic sublimity of the subject than by the science, 
                    although the works contain hints that he gained at least a basic conceptual understanding of the apparent rotations of the solar system and the fixed stars.</p>

                            and there follow lists of constellation names paired with their respective numbers of stars. The identity of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;lesson book&#x201D; has so far eluded detection 
                            since <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName>&#x02BC;s totals of stars fail to match the numbers given in British astronomy texts commonly available in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>. 
                            The counts of observable stars within the constellation boundaries changed over time, and the constellations themselves 
                            changed as new ones were added and others consigned to obsolescence, so it is not necessarily surprising that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s source remains unidentified. 
                            It is also possible that he devised his own method of counting stars, such as numbering only stars of a certain magnitude that he found on a celestial globe or star chart. 
                            Whatever the case, the kind of text normally associated with this exacting information was a <hi rend="italic">star atlas</hi>.</p>

                        <p>Notwithstanding <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s target audience of &#x201C;beginners, rather than . . . adepts&#x201D;, 
                            any star atlas would have posed a daunting text for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> at ages seven to nine. In <date when="1835">1835</date>, 
                            when he was sixteen, the Ruskins may have acquired a different textbook by <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>,

                            This text is identified in the family library by <persName corresp="JSD">Dearden</persName>, predicated on an entry, &#x201C;<persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName> 6/6&#x201D;, dated <date when="1835-05-14">14 May 1835</date> 
                            in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref> (39v), an entry that, 
                            as <persName corresp="VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName> admits, could apply, not just to various works by <persName corresp="#AJ">Alexander Jamieson</persName> 
                            but also to works by the geologist <persName corresp="RJAMIESON">Robert Jamieson</persName> (<date notBefore="1774" notAfter="1854">1774&#x2013;1854</date>)

                            Identification of this item recorded in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s accounts as a textbook by <persName corresp="#AJ">Alexander Jamieson</persName> is therefore problematic, 
                            although <persName corresp="JSD">Dearden</persName> correlates this item with a gift to the <orgName corresp="WORKINGMENSCOLLEGE">Working Men&#x02BC;s College</orgName> in <date when="1858">1858</date>.</p>
                        
                        <p>While it is not impossible that the Ruskin family would have acquired <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s star atlas&#x2014;priced at 1&#x00A3; 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi> for plain, 
                            and 1&#x00A3; 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi> for hand&#x2010;colored, the <title type="book" corresp="#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Celestial Atlas</hi></title> was intended as a popular alternative 
                            to the grand atlases produced for specialists and collectors (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RIDPATHALEXANDERJAMIESON"><persName corresp="#IRIDPATH">Ridpath</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#RIDPATHALEXANDERJAMIESON">&#x201C;Alexander Jamieson&#x201D;</title></ref>)&#x2014;it is questionable, 
                            albeit not impossible, that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was equal to employing such a text to compile his lists of constellations with star numberings 
                            in <date notBefore="1828" notAfter="1829">1828/29</date>. Whether or not he might have consulted the <title type="book" corresp="#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Celestial Atlas</hi></title> or another star atlas directly, however, 
                            <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s textbook informed other, introductory&#x2010;level texts of the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, and its plates and text were readily plagiarized 
                            by creators of British astronomy primers and instructional devices of the period. As advised by an author of astronomy primer for children, 
                            <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName>: &#x201C;A teacher, when hearing the class, should use globes, or plates, 
                            such as may be found in most elementary books of astronomy, to assist the children in understanding what they learn&#x201D;

                            By whatever means <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collected his astronomical informtion, his identification of certain modern constellations suggest 
                            that his source was informed by no earlier star atlas than <title type="book" corresp="#BODEURANOGRAPHIA"><hi rend="italic">Uranographia</hi></title> (<date when="1801">1801</date>) by the German astronomer,

                            explaining how <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s names for these constellations are consistent with <persName corresp="#JBODE">Bode</persName>&#x02BC;s influence.

                            which became established as constellations only with the help of <persName corresp="#JBODE">Bode</persName>&#x02BC;s influence. See also the contextual gloss for

                            a French Enlightenment&#x2010;era constellation which, only in <persName corresp="#JBODE">Bode</persName>&#x02BC;s atlas and its descendants, 
                            stood alongside of (rather than displacing) <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSOAK">Robur Carolinum</name>, a seventeenth&#x2010;century tribute to <persName corresp="#KC2">King Charles II of England</persName>, 
                            which the French inventor was determined to eradicate from the southern sky.
                            Slight evidence pointing away from <persName corresp="#JBODE">Bode</persName>&#x02BC;s influence is found in the contextual gloss for the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CERBERUSCONSTELLATION">Cerberus</name>,

                                            and ornamented, and gilded: but what is there in all these things to be compared with the sight of these luminous bodies that adorn every part of the sky?<lb/><lb/>

                                While often emphasizing the aesthetic side of astronomy, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> does not often rise to a rhapsodic mode. 
                                When he approaches that strain, as in <ref type="apparatus" target="the_sun_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESUN">&#x201C;The Sun&#x201D;</title></ref>,

                                    a late addition (1822) to <persName corresp="#ME">Maria Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="series" corresp="#EDGEWORTHEARLYLESSONS"><hi rend="italic">Early Lessons</hi></title> series,

                                    the dialogues that compose the tale are aimed less at information about astronomy per se than at an ethical framework for learning.

                                    &#x201C;habit of self&#x2010;control . . . by inspiring [a boy] in his own mind the wish to control himself&#x201D;. 
                                    By this means, when a youth leaves home for school, parents can rely on their son&#x02BC;s self&#x2010;discipline to guard against temptations to dissipation

                                    (perhaps the inspiration of the exercise devised by <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TUTORTD">Tutor</persName>) and invented and constructed astronomical and other instruments, although some of his inventions already existed. 
                                    Admiration of this biography deranges <persName corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName>&#x02BC;s more modest and systematic lessons with his mother, who warns him that

                                    Nonetheless, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> is ambitious to imitate <persName corresp="#JFERGUSON">Ferguson</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;projects&#x201D;, first attempting and failing with <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MARYME">Mary</persName> to make their own paper&#x2010;covered globe. 
                                    &#x201C;But still as one scheme failed, another rose in <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName>&#x02BC;s imagination; and he went on from one to another, 
                                    pleased always with the last new idea, yet finishing few; for some he found impossible, some not sufficiently surprising, 
                                    and almost all were too tiresome, he said, to be worth completing&#x201D;. Finally, enchanted by an engraving of an orrery in <persName corresp="#JFERGUSON">Ferguson</persName>&#x02BC;s book&#x2014;a 
                                    mechanical model of the solar system, which <persName corresp="#JFERGUSON">Ferguson</persName> had also devised on his own system, without investigating the mechanisms of existing orreries&#x2014;<persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> 
                                    himself ventures on this &#x201C;&#x2018;very ingenious thing, exceedingly ingenious&#x2019;&#x201D;. Although he sets forth without learning even &#x201C;half . . . [of the planets&#x02BC;] motions&#x201D;, 
                                    having neglected the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#ENGINEERME">Engineer</persName>&#x02BC;s assignment of readings in <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES">Scientific Dialogues</title><!--italic?-->, he believes he could teach himself, like <persName corresp="#JFERGUSON">Ferguson</persName>, &#x201C;as he went on with his work&#x201D;; 
                                    and his mother, unaware of the extent of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName>&#x02BC;s ambitions, allows him to proceed, so that he &#x201C;will soon find out, by your own experience, what you can, and what you cannot do&#x201D;. 
                                    While he at least sticks to a single project, the complexity of the orrery soon exceeds <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName>&#x02BC;s abilities, and he nearly disgraces himself in reciting his appointed studies. 
                                    His father counsels him: &#x201C;&#x2018;I would rather, . . . as your father and friend, . . that you had the power of keeping to your resolutions, 
                                    than that you made the most ingenious thing that ever was thought of by a boy of your age&#x2019;&#x201D;

                                <p>The dialogue recognizes that learning complex sciences calls on abilites and virtues that can conflict with one another&#x2014;ingenuity and resolution, enthusiasm and steadiness. 
                                    As <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MAMMAME">Mamma</persName> admits to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MARYME">Mary</persName>: &#x201C;&#x2018;It is rather hard, I allow, . . . to reproach poor <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> at the same moment with two seemingly opposite faults, 
                                    with his not finishing any thing, and with his being too eager to finish one thing&#x2019;&#x201D;. In the tale&#x02BC;s primary mission to instruct a child&#x02BC;s self&#x2010;command, however, 
                                    the point of an episode of conflict is less to resolve competing virtues philosophically than for the child to internalize regulation of feeling. 
                                    As <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> promises in future to portion his time judiciously between fundamental lessons and ingenious projects, 
                                    his stirred &#x201C;feelings of this moment would have inclined him to do too much, and to fix upon too many hours for <hi rend="italic">useful</hi> studies; 
                                    but his mother advised him to attempt little, and engage but for few, that he might be more likely to keep to his intentions&#x201D;. 
                                    Because the aim is self&#x2010;regulation of feeling, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName>&#x02BC;s mother considers but one virtue to be paramount in the jostling of abilities: 
                                    candour, the want of which she expects &#x201C;&#x2018;never [to] reproach him&#x2019;&#x201D;, since a misleading expression of feeling deranges the aim. 
                                    The contrary example of frank expresion in the tale is the dishonest boy, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMME">Tom</persName>, whose lying vies with his spontaneous emotion, 
                                    and his silly mother, whose vanity and flightiness prevents her reading her child&#x02BC;s expression insightfully

                            <p><persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s lists of constellation names omit any information that is classified under each constellation name in a star atlas,

                                As exercises in memorization, the scripture quotations that annotate the lists are at least as important as the constellation names. 
                                Following the lists, <persName corresp="#MMS">Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s text does explain rudimentary concepts, such as the <hi rend="italic">ecliptic</hi> and celestial <hi rend="italic">equator</hi>,

                                each card depicting the mythological representation of one or more constellations. The cards were perforated at the positions of the stars 
                                forming the constellation so that, when held up to a light, the cards mimicked a &#x201C;view&#x201D; of the respective constellations in the &#x201C;heavens&#x201D; with the colorful mythical figures superimposed. 
                                The cards were engraved by <persName corresp="#SHALL">Sidney Hall</persName> (<date notBefore="1788" notAfter="1831">1788/89[?]&#x2013;1831</date>), the first map maker to engrave on steel,

                                The identity of <persName corresp="#JASPIN">Jehoshaphat Aspin</persName> is also obscure, an author of a number of works for young readers, which were published in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> by the firm of <orgName corresp="#JOHNHARRISPUB">John Harris</orgName>, such as

                            <p>While the purpose of <title type="book" corresp="#ASPINASTRONOMY"><hi rend="italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</hi></title> does not, like <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s book, subordinate the science of astronomy to religious admiration, 
                                the introduction gestures at the &#x201C;sublime idea&#x201D; of &#x201C;worlds . . . peopled with myriads of intelligent beings, 
                                formed for endless progression towards perfection and felicity&#x201D; as governed by the &#x201C;<hi rend="smallcaps">INFINITE MIND</hi>&#x201D;; 
                                the chapter &#x201C;History of Astronomy&#x201D; begins with star&#x2010;gazing as recorded in the <title type="scripture" corresp="#GENESIS">Genesis</title> narrative; 
                                and the chapter &#x201C;Fixed Stars&#x201D; impresses on the reader that &#x201C;[t]he immense distance of the fixed stars from our earth, 
                                and from each other, is of all considerations the most proper for raising our ideas of the wonderful works of God&#x201D;

                                Otherwise, the approach of the <title type="book" corresp="#ASPINASTRONOMY"><hi rend="italic">Familiar Treatise</hi></title> is nearer to the conceptual understanding sought by the instructional dialogues than to memorization exercises.</p>
                            
                            <p>To create the constellation cards for <title type="toy" corresp="#URANIASMIRROR"><hi rend="italic">Urania&#x02BC;s Mirror</hi></title>, the engraver or the artist plagiarized the representations 
                                of the mythical figures drawn for <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Celestial Atlas</hi></title>, 
                                as <persName corresp="#IRIDPATH">Ridpath</persName> has remarked (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RIDPATHURANIASMIRROR">&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Urania&#x02BC;s Mirror</hi>&#x201D;</ref>). 
                                Likewise, to compile the accompanying primer, <persName corresp="#JASPIN">Aspin</persName> and the publisher appear to have drawn heavily on <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s atlas, while also moderating its forbiddingly technical demands 
                                for the common reader, including (it claims) younger readers. Just as the <title type="book" corresp="#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Celestial Atlas</hi></title> begins with &#x201C;Definitions&#x201D;, the <title type="book" corresp="#ASPINASTRONOMY"><hi rend="italic">Familiar Treatise</hi></title> presents &#x201C;Terms Used in Astronomy&#x201D;; however, 
                                whereas <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName> follows with &#x201C;Of the Manner of Using the Maps&#x201D;, presented as a series of technical &#x201C;problems&#x201D; requiring mathematical skills, 
                                the <title type="book" corresp="#ASPINASTRONOMY"><hi rend="italic">Familiar Treatise</hi></title> eases the reader into a series of brief essays beginning broadly with &#x201C;Of the Celestial Bodies Generally&#x201D;. 
                                From there, the <title type="book" corresp="#ASPINASTRONOMY"><hi rend="italic">Familiar Treatise</hi></title> surveys topics familiar to young readers of the dialogues&#x2014;gravitation, the structure and movements of the solar system, the bodies forming the solar system&#x2014;but 
                                explained in greater detail and illustrated with diagrams. Only after this extensive preparation is the reader introduced to the constellations&#x2014;the topic used by the astronomical dialogues 
                                and even by <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s primer to snare the young reader&#x02BC;s initial interest in astronomy. The best is saved for last, however, 
                                as this section is keyed to the kit&#x02BC;s accompanying constellation cards. Following an introductory chapter on the fixed stars, the constellations are described in the order and in the groups 
                                depicted on the cards, again borrowing from <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s text (in reduced form), by first summarizing each contellation&#x02BC;s boundaries, chief stars and their magnitudes, and other identifying features; 
                                and then by relating, in short form, its legendary &#x201C;fable&#x201D;. This plan was in turn copied

                            <p><!-- 01-26-24 -->As a primer for study specifically of the constellations, <persName corresp="#JASPIN">Aspin</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#ASPINASTRONOMY"><hi rend="italic">A Familiar Treatise</hi></title> 
                                differs from star atlases and even from other primers by limiting its scope to constellations viewable from <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>&#x2014;a feature 
                                rendering the book less likely to have served as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s source for <!-- apparatus and title --><ref type="apparatus" target="constellations_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                                albeit opening a window onto the uniquely British amateur astronomer in the <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1899">nineteenth century</date>. For example, the section on the constellations supplies two fold&#x2010;out maps, 
                                one a planar representation of the &#x201C;Northern Hemisphere&#x201D; (cribbed from <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s chart in the <title type="book" corresp="#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Celestial Atlas</hi></title>), 
                                piecing together all the sectional views with outlines of the mythical figures, as rendered on the cards making up <name type="toy" corresp="#URANIASMIRROR">&#x201C;Urania&#x02BC;s Mirror&#x201D;</name>; 
                                and the second a &#x201C;Chart of the Heavens from the Latitude of <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>&#x201D;, divided into the boundaries of the visible constellations, 
                                each of which is tinted with a distinct color for clarity and mapped with the constellation&#x02BC;s chief stars. 
                                The book presents no fold&#x2010;out chart of the southern hemisphere, however; and while providing a list of the southern constellations, 
                                the detailed descriptions of each constellation, like the cards constituting <name type="toy" corresp="#URANIASMIRROR">Urania&#x02BC;s Mirror</name>, 
                                include only those southern constellations that are partially visible at the latitude of <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>. 
                                In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title>, the first two southern constellations that are listed in the poem (in its original version), 
                                the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CRUX">Southern Cross</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSOAK">Charles&#x02BC;s Oak</name>, are never visible from <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> and therefore omitted from representation or discussion 
                                in <title type="book" corresp="#ASPINASTRONOMY"><hi rend="italic">A Familiar Treatise</hi></title> and <name type="toy" corresp="#URANIASMIRROR">Urania&#x02BC;s Mirror</name> except for their names in the plenary list of southern constellations.

                            <p>In his poetic representations of celestial bodies and in his imitations of astronomy lessons in his <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title> narratives, 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> seems to waver between memorization tasks in the style of <persName corresp="#MMS">Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s primer and the wonder and discovery encouraged by <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s, <persName corresp="#ALB">Barbauld</persName>&#x02BC;s, and <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s dialogues, 
                                and between the religious emphasis in <persName corresp="#MMS">Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#JASPIN">Aspin</persName>&#x02BC;s references to Scripture and the resolutely secular and scientific program of observation in <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s tutelage. 
                           here     In <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                                <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> takes &#x201C;one of his lesson books&#x201D; and assigns <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> 
                                a memorization drill, which lists constellation names like <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s exercise, but which is thoroughly secular, with no <title type="scripture" corresp="#KJV">Bible</title> verses attached. 
                                The drill also suggests, however, that he consulted either a star atlas or a primer like <persName corresp="#JASPIN">Aspin</persName>&#x02BC;s derived from an atlas, since <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> is ordered 
                                to &#x201C;learn the following constellations with the number of stars&#x201D; belonging to each formation. 
                                There follow at intervals in the narrative columns of ten to twelve constellation names in English with their respective total number of stars, 
                                which <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> memorizes each morning 
                                <!--might have played such an instructional game with his cousin, <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName>, who now lived with the Ruskins, and who may have originated the role of astronomy student as depicted in  -->

                                The numbers of stars do not correspond to those given in any astronomy &#x201C;lesson book&#x201D; discovered so far, but Ruskin clearly was aware that 
                                tables with that information feature in atlases and advanced primers.</p>

                            In <date when="1828">1828</date>, if they had acquired <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="lesson" corresp="#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Celestial Atlas</hi></title>, its exercises would surely have demanded too much of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s abilities. As 
                            remarked previously, the random order in which he names constellations in his poem suggests that he failed to master even the most basic astronomical concepts,  
                            as presented in <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s elementary primer. Nonetheless, the atlas would have appealed not only in its visual depictions and prose summaries of myths; 
                            it would also have bolstered <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s pride in British achievements in astronomical discovery and science. A consistent theme in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem is his observance of constellations with British associations, such as 
                            <name type="astronomical" corresp="CORCAROLISTAR">Cor Caroli (Charles&#x02BC;s Heart)</name>, <name type="astronomical" corresp="ROBURCAROLINUM">Robur Caroli (Charles&#x02BC;s Oak)</name>, and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#TELESCOPIUM">Telescopium Herschelii (Herschell&#x02BC;s Telescope)</name>.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p><persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName> advises: &#x201C;A teacher, when hearing the class, should use globes, or plates, 
                            such as may be found in most elementary books of astronomy, to assist the children in understanding what they learn&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><title type="book" corresp="#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><hi rend="italic">Introduction to Astronomy</hi></title></ref>, vii). 
                            Plates and globes depicted the mythical figures for which the constellations were named; and plates were found in star atlases, 
                            which among other information related the stories associated with the stars and constellations, 
                            such as the myth of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MILKYWAY">Milky Way (Via Lactea)</name> that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> uses to frame his conclusion to the second fair copy (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>): 
                            &#x201C;the ancients thought&#x201D; it &#x201C;the road / Which all their best and bravest trod / Unto great <persName type="fictional" corresp="#JUPITERGOD">Jupiters</persName> blest abode&#x201D;.</p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>Still, a confirmed source of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s exposure to the mythology of the constellations remains elusive, as does a measure of his knowledge of those stories. 
                            The contextual glosses identify the constellations named in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem and summarize their stories, 
                            drawing on two sources published in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>: <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="lesson" corresp="#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Celestial Atlas</hi></title> and an American work (partly dependent on <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s), 
                            <title type="book" corresp="GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS">Astronomical Recreations</title> (<date when="1824">1824</date>) by <persName corresp="JGREEN">Jacob Green</persName> (<date notBefore="1790" notAfter="1841">1790&#x2010;1841</date>). 
                            How familiar this information would have been to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself in this period is unknown.</p>
