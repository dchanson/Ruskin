                <p>Between <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1828">1826 and 1828</date>, astronomy featured persistently in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poetry and prose, 
                    from his first mention of the typical beginner&#x02BC;s constellation for British children, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name>, 
                    in the <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1827">1826/27</date> poem, 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#GLENOFGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; [&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;]</title></ref>; 
                    to his cataloguing of constellation names from all around the celestial globe in the <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1828">1827/28</date> poem, 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="constellations_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title></ref>; 
                    to his assigning the task of memorizing constellation names and their respective numbers of stars to his character <persName corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> in the dialogue, 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III&#x201D;</title></ref>;
                    to his Miltonic hymn of praise in the New Year&#x02BC;s poem for <date when="1828-01-01">January 1828</date>, 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="the_sun_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESUN">&#x201C;The Sun&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> composed these works in context of rising popular education in astronomy for adults and children 
                    in the <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1839">first three decades of the nineteenth century</date> in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>. 
                    On this evidence, he was engaged more by the poetic sublimity of the subject than by the science, although these works contain hints that he gained at least basic conceptual 
                    understanding of the solar system and the fixed stars.</p>

                            and there follow lists of constellation names paired with their respective numbers of stars. The identity of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;lesson book&#x201D; has eluded detection 
                            since <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName>&#x02BC;s totals of stars have so far failed to match the statistics supplied in British astronomy texts commonly available in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>. 
                            These counts of observable stars within the constellation boundaries changed over time, and the constellations themselves 
                            changed as new ones were added and others consigned to obsolescence, so <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s source may yet be found. 
                            Or he may have devised his own method of counting stars, such as numbering only stars of a certain magnitude. 
                            Whatever the case, the kind of book normally associated with this exacting information was a <hi rend="italic">star atlas</hi>.</p>

                            the British public with a star atlas that boasted a dedication to the king, <persName corresp="KG4">George IV</persName>, and that could compete credibly with the French and German atlases then in common use.

                            any star atlas would have posed a daunting text for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> at ages seven to nine. In <date when="1835">1835</date>,

                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s foundational reading about astronomy was in the form of educational dialogues, 
                            of which the earliest was likelu John Aikin and Letitia Barbauld's Evenings at Home 
                            (see Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Boyhood and Youth--<hi rend="italic">Beinecke</hi> no. 4; 
                            and Hanson, &#x201C;Materiality in John Ruskin&#x02BC;s Early Letters and Dialogues&#x201D;, 29-30). The conversations on astronomy are widely interspersed among other topics, 
                            thus playing out difficult and abstract concepts gradually and building on one another. 
                            On the fourteenth evening, a dialogue between Papa and Lucy, "Why an Apple Falls", leads from reasoning about the force of gravitation on small objects 
                            to the forces commanding the earth as a "vast ball . . . continually spinning around", which "is the cause why the sun and stars seem to rise and set". 
                            The dialogue ends by asking "why the earth does not fall into the sun". (Apropos, this dialogue is preceded by a poem, "Phaeton Junior; or, The Gig Demolished", 
                            a homely version of the myth.) This problem is revived on the nineteenth evening in "Why the Earth Moves Round the Sun", 
                            summoning everyday examples to explain centrifugal and centripetal forces, which "[b]y the wonderful skill of the Creator . . . were made 
                            exactly to counterbalance each other; so that just as much as the earth . . . tends to fly forwards, just so much the sun draws it to the centre". 
                            Finally, on the thirtieth evening in "A Globe Lecture", Papa reminds Lucy where they left the topic of the earth's orbit and teaches Lucy the use of a globe 
                            in understanding the world's climates and their influence on vegetation, animals, and human cultures, leaving an explanation of the solar system for another day when he will "take you 
                            to the lecture of an ingenious philosopher who has contrived a machine that will give you a better notion" of the planetary movements--an orrery, 
                            which Ruskin would next have read about in Maria Edgeworth's final volumes of her Early Lessons series, 
                            Frank: A Sequel and Harry and Lucy Concuded
                            (Aikin and Barbauld, Evenings at Home, 3:127-28, 129, 115-21; 4:117-18; 6:123).</p>

                            where <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> offers to &#x201C;give . . . [<persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName>] a drawing of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">charles&#x02bc;s wain</name> 
                            as an introduction to astronomy&#x201D;. The drawing, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> illustrates with his own drawing in the text, reproduces a diagram in volume 2, 
                            &#x201C;Of Astronomy&#x201D;, of <persName corresp="#JJ">Jeremiah Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></title>. 
                            In <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s dialogue, the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TUTORJJ">Tutor</persName> shows this diagram to his pupils, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#CHARLESJJ">Charles</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#JAMESJJ">James</persName>, 
                            just as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> presents the drawing to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName>, 
                            as a first step in learning &#x201C;&#x2018;how to distinguish the stars, and . . . call them by their proper names&#x2019;&#x201D;. The <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TUTORJJ">Tutor</persName> 
                            points out <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC; Wain</name> in the night sky, and describes the formation using the diagram&#x2014;four stars forming a wagon, and three stars making the horses, 
                            all of them also forming part of a larger constellation, the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Great Bear or Ursa Major</name>. This constellation, he explains, can serve as a compass for finding one&#x02BC;s bearings at night, 
                            without the sun&#x02BC;s position to define east and west. As a northern, circumpolar constellation, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC; Wain</name> is always visible on a clear night;

                                        in observing such a number of glorious, glittering bodies as are now above us. We sometimes run to see a procession of coaches, 
                                        or a few people in fine clothes strutting about; we admire a large room that is painted, and ornamented, and gilded: 
                                        but what is there in all these things to be compared with the sight of these luminous bodies that adorn every part of the sky?</p>

                            the poem along with <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName>&#x02BC;s drawing effectively forms <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;introduction to astronomy&#x201D;; and in the context of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s reading about astronomy, 
                            the poem&#x02BC;s somewhat random and poeticized listing the star clusters carries out in its own way the method, recommended by <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName>, of &#x201C;remembering these stars 
                            [forming <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name>]&#x201D; so that &#x201C;you may very easily observe those which are next to them, and learn their names too, till you are acquainted with the whole face of the heavens&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><hi rend="italic">History of Sandford and Merton</hi></title></ref>, 163). 
                            Just so, in <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></title>, the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TUTORJJ">Tutor</persName> instructs his pupils, 
                            <persName type="fictional" corresp="#CHARLESJJ">Charles</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#JAMESJJ">James</persName>, in the names and positions of the constellations.</p>
                        
                        <p>In the opening of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title>, the tutelage of <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s, <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s, and <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s practical and scientific astronomy lessons is perceptible 
                            in the tactic of starting from a prominent point of reference in the sky, although not, in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s case, with a constellation, but with a planet, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name>, the so&#x2010;called Morning Star and Evening Star, 
                            which is a wandering rather than a fixed star. &#x201C;Dost thou see&#x201D;, the poem asks, how <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> is associated with the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> 
                            as these bodies fall below the horizon in the west? From there, the poem turns to the next planet on the ecliptic, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name>, 
                            and then re&#x2010;orients to the circumpolar constellations overhead. The method does not adopt <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy Sandford</persName>&#x02BC;s more practical and reliable recommendation of first finding <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name> and then tracing its pointer stars to the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#NORTHSTAR">Pole Star</name>; 
                            instead, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s sequence starts from &#x201C;stars&#x201D; traditionally regarded as the most beautiful&#x2014;the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUS">Evening Star</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion&#x02BC;s Belt</name>, 
                            &#x201C;a glorious sight for all sky loving men&#x201D;&#x2014;and thence carries on to the circumpolar formations. From this more sublimely oriented beginning, the poem does proceed to follow <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName>&#x02BC;s advice, 
                            that &#x201C;by remembering these stars [of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name>], you may very easily observe those which are next to them, and learn their names too, till you are acquainted with the whole face of the heavens&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><hi rend="italic">History of Sandford and Merton</hi></title></ref>, 163). 
                            As <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem clicks along, however, while repeating &#x201c;next&#x201D; and &#x201c;next&#x201D; 
                            the sequence becomes erratic. As suggested by the poem&#x02BC;s title, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears to have extended belatedly in order to account for &#x201C;some of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ZODIAC">zodiac</name> and some of the southern&#x201D; constellations 
                            that had found their way into the poem along with the survey of the visible &#x201C;northern&#x201D; sky (see <ref type="intenal" target="#TITLE">Title</ref>), the sequence reveals a logic at best only intermittently 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#REAL-LIFE">Real&#x2010;life Observations</ref>). Aware of the systematic procedure advised by his books&#x02BC; astronomy lessons, he added the caveat, 
                            &#x201C;These constellations though they are next in this poetry are not next in the sky&#x201d;, 
                            to the second and final fair copy (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>). Whatever led his fancy, the poem is livelier 
                            than <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s bare and wooden lists set up alongside Bible verses for rote memorization.</p></div>
                    
                    
                            
                            
                        
                        
                            In <date when="1828">1828</date>, if they had acquired <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="lesson" corresp="#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Celestial Atlas</hi></title>, its exercises would surely have demanded too much of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s abilities. As 
                            remarked previously, the random order in which he names constellations in his poem suggests that he failed to master even the most basic astronomical concepts,  
                            as presented in <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s elementary primer. Nonetheless, the atlas would have appealed not only in its visual depictions and prose summaries of myths; 
                            it would also have bolstered <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s pride in British achievements in astronomical discovery and science. A consistent theme in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem is his observance of constellations with British associations, such as 
                            <name type="astronomical" corresp="CORCAROLISTAR">Cor Caroli (Charles&#x02BC;s Heart)</name>, <name type="astronomical" corresp="ROBURCAROLINUM">Robur Caroli (Charles&#x02BC;s Oak)</name>, and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#TELESCOPIUM">Telescopium Herschelii (Herschell&#x02BC;s Telescope)</name>.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p><persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName> advises: &#x201C;A teacher, when hearing the class, should use globes, or plates, 
                            such as may be found in most elementary books of astronomy, to assist the children in understanding what they learn&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><title type="book" corresp="#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><hi rend="italic">Introduction to Astronomy</hi></title></ref>, vii). 
                            Plates and globes depicted the mythical figures for which the constellations were named; and plates were found in star atlases, 
                            which among other information related the stories associated with the stars and constellations, 
                            such as the myth of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MILKYWAY">Milky Way (Via Lactea)</name> that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> uses to frame his conclusion to the second fair copy (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>): 
                            &#x201C;the ancients thought&#x201D; it &#x201C;the road / Which all their best and bravest trod / Unto great <persName type="fictional" corresp="#JUPITERGOD">Jupiters</persName> blest abode&#x201D;.</p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>Still, a confirmed source of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s exposure to the mythology of the constellations remains elusive, as does a measure of his knowledge of those stories. 
                            The contextual glosses identify the constellations named in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem and summarize their stories, 
                            drawing on two sources published in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>: <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="lesson" corresp="#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Celestial Atlas</hi></title> and an American work (partly dependent on <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s),

                            How familiar this information would have been to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself in this period is unknown.</p>
