                <p>Between 1826 and 1828, astronomy featured persistently in Ruskin's poetry and prose, 
                    from the mention of the British child's beginner's constellation, Charles's Wain, in the 1826/27 poem, 
                    <!-- APPARATUS LINK --><title type="poem" corresp="#GLENOFGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; [&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;]</title>; 
                    to the catalogue of constellation names from all around the celestial globe, 
                    <!-- APPARATUS LINK --><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title>; 
                    to Lucy's task of memorizing constellations and their respective numbers of stars in 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III&#x201D;</title></ref>
                    to the Miltonic hymn of praise in the New Year's poem for January 1828, 
                    <!-- APPARATUS LINK --><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESUN">&#x201C;The Sun&#x201D;</title>. 
                    Ruskin composed these works in context of rising popular education in astronomy for adults and children 
                    in the <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1839">first three decades of the early nineteenth century</date> in Britain. 
                    He was engaged primarily by the poetic sublimity of the subject, although these works contain hints that he gained at least basic conceptual 
                    understanding of the solar system.</p>

                        <p>In <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                            Ruskin's "Harry" "took one of his lesson books and made <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> learn the following constellations with the number of stars" (chap. 1); 
                            and there follow at intervals lists of constellation names with their respective total counts of stars comprised within each formation. 
                            The "lesson book" that sourced Ruskin's star numbers has so far eluded detection, since his totals fail to match the statistics supplied in British astronomy texts commonly available in the 1820s. 
                            Changes of course occurred over time in the observable number of stars counted within the constellation boundaries, and the constellations themselves 
                            changed as new ones were added and others consigned to obsolescence. Ruskin may also have based his counts on some method of his own devising, 
                            such as numbering only stars of a certain magnitude. In any case, this kind of information was found in a <hi rend="italic">star atlas</hi>.</p>
                        
                        <p>Of star atlases that might have been available to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in the 1820s, 
                            a logical choice would have been the chief modern British accomplishment in this field,

                            which included lessons and exercises designed for &#x201C;beginners, rather than . . . adepts in the science&#x201D;, and which was 
                            &#x201C;composed in a popular language, without any regard to the learned phraseology of Astronomers&#x201D; (<title type="essay" corresp="#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS-PREFACE">preface</title>, ii). 
                            Embellished with plates elegantly rendering the mythical figures representing the constellations, the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Celestial Atlas</hi></title></ref> provided 
                            a British public with a star atlas that could compete with the French and German atlases then in common use.

                            any star atlas would have posed a daunting text for Ruskin at ages seven to nine. In <date when="1835">1835</date>, 
                            when he was sixteen, the Ruskins may have acquired a different textbook by <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>,

                            but also to works by the geologist <persName corresp="RJAMIESON">Robert Jamieson</persName> [<date notBefore="1774" notAfter="1854">1774&#x2013;1854</date>].

                            Identification of this item recorded in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s accounts as a textbook by <persName corresp="#AJ">Alexander Jamieson</persName> is unclear, therefore, 
                            although <persName corresp="JSD">Dearden</persName> correlates this item with a gift to the <orgName corresp="WORKINGMENSCOLLEGE">Working Men&#x02BC;s College</orgName> in <date when="1858">1858</date>.)</p>
                        
                        <p>Regardless of whether Ruskin was exposed directly to Jamieson's Celestial Atlas, 
                            the publication influenced other, more introductory-level texts that he might have used. 
                            
                            <here></here>
                        
                        
                            In <date when="1828">1828</date>, if they had acquired <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="lesson" corresp="#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Celestial Atlas</hi></title>, its exercises would surely have demanded too much of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s abilities. As 
                            remarked previously, the random order in which he names constellations in his poem suggests that he failed to master even the most basic astronomical concepts,  
                            as presented in <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s elementary primer. Nonetheless, the atlas would have appealed not only in its visual depictions and prose summaries of myths; 
                            it would also have bolstered <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s pride in British achievements in astronomical discovery and science. A consistent theme in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem is his observance of constellations with British associations, such as 
                            <name type="astronomical" corresp="CORCAROLISTAR">Cor Caroli (Charles&#x02BC;s Heart)</name>, <name type="astronomical" corresp="ROBURCAROLINUM">Robur Caroli (Charles&#x02BC;s Oak)</name>, and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#TELESCOPIUM">Telescopium Herschelii (Herschell&#x02BC;s Telescope)</name>.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p><persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName> advises: &#x201C;A teacher, when hearing the class, should use globes, or plates, 
                            such as may be found in most elementary books of astronomy, to assist the children in understanding what they learn&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><title type="book" corresp="#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><hi rend="italic">Introduction to Astronomy</hi></title></ref>, vii). 
                            Plates and globes depicted the mythical figures for which the constellations were named; and plates were found in star atlases, 
                            which among other information related the stories associated with the stars and constellations, 
                            such as the myth of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MILKYWAY">Milky Way (Via Lactea)</name> that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> uses to frame his conclusion to the second fair copy (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>): 
                            &#x201C;the ancients thought&#x201D; it &#x201C;the road / Which all their best and bravest trod / Unto great <persName type="fictional" corresp="#JUPITERGOD">Jupiters</persName> blest abode&#x201D;.</p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>Still, a confirmed source of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s exposure to the mythology of the constellations remains elusive, as does a measure of his knowledge of those stories. 
                            The contextual glosses identify the constellations named in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem and summarize their stories, 
                            drawing on two sources published in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>: <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="lesson" corresp="#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Celestial Atlas</hi></title> and an American work (partly dependent on <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s),

                            How familiar this information would have been to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself in this period is unknown.</p>
