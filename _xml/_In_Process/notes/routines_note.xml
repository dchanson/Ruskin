                <p>Daily routine in the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> household or during family travels can elude recovery, 
                    since rituals tend to be remarked only in the breach, and in any case likely changed over time. 
                    Some evidence of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s daily life in boyhood can be assembled, however, and perhaps contextualized.</p>
                 
                 <div type="section">
                     <head type="section">Lessons and Meals</head>
                     <p>In his <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201c;Harry and Lucy Concluded&#x201d;</title> narratives, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> repeatedly records times for <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">&#x201c;Harry</persName>&#x02bc;s&#x201d; lessons and play periods 
                         in relation to the meals of dinner and tea. According to <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201c;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I&#x201d;</title>, 
                         <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> &#x201c;always went to his lessons at twelve&#x201d; (chap. 9) at least when vacationing at <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName>, 
                         having spent the morning playing on the beach or taking a walk with his father. Noon lessons preceded the midday meal of dinner, 
                         which occurred around <time when="03:00:00">3:00</time> p.m. This time is evidenced by <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName>&#x02bc;s disorientation on the longest day of the year, the summer soltice, 
                         when the lingering light caused evening tea to arrive &#x201c;seemingly at <time when="03:00:00">three o&#x2010;clock</time>&#x201d;&#x2014;the dinner time&#x2014;instead of its proper time of <time when="07:00:00">7:00</time> p.m. (chap. 8). 
                         Similarly, according to <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL2">&#x201c;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2&#x201d;</title>, a disorientation hinges on this mealtime, 
                         when &#x201c;[a]fter dinner&#x201d; he &#x201c;had to learn his lessons&#x201d; again because they had been 
                         &#x201c;quite driven them out of his head. But he learned them so quickly that he had from three to nine to play 
                         but he did not play he spent from three to half past it in learning his lessons for tomorrow 
                         and spent the rest in drawing took tea and went to bed&#x201d; (chap. 1).</p>
                     
                     <p>Dinner at <time when="03:00:00">three</time> in the afternoon, as <persName corresp="#JUDITHFLANDERS">Judith Flanders</persName> shows, 
                         was considered an older convention in the <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date>&#x2014;observed, for example, 
                         by <persName type="fictional" corresp="#DORASPENLOW">Dora Spenlow</persName>&#x02bc;s old&#x2010;fashioned maiden aunts in <title type="book" corresp="#DICKENSDAVIDCOPPERFIELD"><hi rend="italic">David Copperfield</hi></title>, 
                         who correspondingly take their tea at <time when="06:30:00">six&#x2010;thirty</time> in the evening. 
                         Fashionable life later in the century called for evening dining at six or seven. 
                         Even the elder Ruskins, when entertaining, liked an evening dinner, so <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> 
                         could sit up until <time when="12:00:00">midnight</time> talking with friends. When married, <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> and <persName corresp="#ECG">Effie</persName> 
                         apparently set an unusually early dinner of one in the afternoon at their house in 
                         <placeName type="building" corresp="#PARKST">Park Street</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, 
                         followed by an evening tea. This meal schedule perhaps revolved around <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02bc;s work, 
                         just as meals were timed with his lessons in boyhood
