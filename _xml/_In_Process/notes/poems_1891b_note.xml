                <p>The Poems of John Ruskin, edited by <!-- refs to Allen and Collingwood biographical note as well as persName tags -->W. G. Collingwood, 
                    was published by George Allen in 1891. The two-volume edition was released in the two forms that, by then, 
                    Allen had established on a plan that was profitable while remaining responsive to Ruskin's ideas for fair trade in making books and in selling and distributing them. 
                    For modest consumers, Allen made the two volumes available for ten shillings net, in the sturdy and serviceable <!-- ref to note-->Uniform Edition. 
                    For collectors, he produced a deluxe edition, lavishing his craftsman's love for fine bookmaking on what a 1900 advertisement described as 
                    "a Large Edition, with 23 Illustrations in Photogravure from Drawings by the Author and Facsimiles of MSS. Medium 4to", priced at thirty shillings for the two volumes 
                    (see Dawson, The People's Ruskin, ii). A few manuscript facsimiles were bound into volume 1 of the Uniform Edition copies of Poems, as well, 
                    the embellishments evidently being regarded as necessary to the reader's experience of the boyhood poems, 
                    just as the witnesses of <!-- ref to note-->Ruskin&#x02bc;s Handwriting in boyhood was integral to Collingwood's arguments for dating the poems.</p>

                    <p>Sporadic evidence suggests that plans for publication of the poems developed over a number of years. 
                        Presumably, from Ruskin's standpoint, the private publication of <!-- ref to note plus title tag-->Poems by J. R. (1850) brought to a close 
                        any perceived need for collecting the poem, had Ruskin himself even shared in such a perception. Ironically, 
                        it was the existence of the private edition that, because of its rarity and growing interest as a collector's item, 
                        prompted the American publisher John Wiley &#x0026; Sons in 1882 to assemble <!-- title tag -->Poems by John Ruskin "collected and edited" 
                        by John Osborne Wright from texts originally published in the annuals. The very title page of the Osborne edition was designed 
                        to evoke the sought-after Poems by J. R. "collected | 1850"; and its preface highlighted the current status of the 1850 volume 
                        in the rare-book market, where "copies have become virtually inaccessible except to the most rabid bibliomaniac, 
                        whose heavy purse enables him to successfully outbid competitors in the auction room and bookstore"--a 
                        footnote mentioning the sale of copy in London two years earlier for 41 guineas. Certainly, the Osborne edition constituted 
                        a response the phenomenon of <!-- ref to note -->Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries. 
                        Specifically, its preface implied--whether disingenuously or not, one can now perhaps only speculate--that 
                        the A edition fulfilled a public service by bringing the poems within reach of the common reader.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ruskin's reaction was complicated. Writing in 1882 to Alexander Wedderburn, he fumed, not at America, but at England: 
                        "what a beast British law is! I'm obliged to print these--at least a lot out of--these idiotisms--because 
                        another fellow--a blackguard--called Wily!--has published them without my leave--copyright of Friendships Offering 
                        being out! Theft &#x0026; libel in one!" Whether at home or abroad, literary piracy was mere theft to Ruskin, another way in which authors were denied 
                        fair pay in the tangled system of book dealing, from which he attempted to extricate his work by setting up his own publishing arrangements 
                        overseen by George Allen. At the same time, Ruskin's economic theory was predicated on fair pay for quality, both of ideas and the physically crafted object. 
                        As Brian Maidment has argued, in the persistent problem of American piracy of works by British authors, Ruskin's position 
                        should be recognized as more polemical than those of other writers whose reactions were governed by how piracy affected them personally 
                        (Maidment, "John Ruskin, George Allen, and American Pirated Books", 7-8). The Osborne edition presented an embarrassment, 
                        a "libel" along with a theft, apparently because Ruskin was reduced merely to protecting property rather than staking a claim for fair remuneration 
                        for value--the poems amounting to "idiotisms". Hence, rather than attacking American pirates, he turned on the "beast British law"; 
                        and with only seeming irrelevance, called out "your profession" (Wedderburn was a barrister) for "mak[ing] <hi rend="underline">me</hi> 
                        pay 300 pounds for calling Whistler a coxcomb!" (referring to J. A. M. Whistler's libel case against Ruskin, in which the artist won 
                        only a pyrrhic victory of a farthing in damages, while the artist plaintiff and critic defendant had to split costs). While Ruskin probably 
                        meant to equate his low opinion of the American Whistler's artistic worksmanship with an assessment of Wiley's typically crude bookmaking, Ruskin was not inclined to defend 
                        his poems--as he did stand by his critical assessment of Whistler--thus subjecting him both to the "libel" of his own poems and to the costs 
                        of defending against the poems' theft (Ruskin to A. Wedderburn, 7 February 1882, in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ALSJRTOAW">Ruskin ALS to Alexander Dundas Ogilvy Wedderburn, 1874&#x2013;1888</ref>; 
                        an unknown hand docketed this letter "83" in pencil above Ruskin's "82" for the year).</p>
                        
                        <p>George Allen continued in the struggle against American piracy, but Collingwood's eventual edition played little part. 
                            Although published in the year of the International Copyright Act ("Chace Act"), 
                            the 1891 Poems did not profit by the agreement, which applied only to new works published after 1891. 
                            As it turned out, the first book by Ruskin that Allen succeeded in bringing out in compliance with the act's strenuous regulations 
                            was Verona and Its Rivers (1893). Meanwhile, 
                            Collingwood's edition was published in the U.S. legally, as part of the "Brantwood Edition" of Ruskin's works, 
                            which was produced under an agreement with the New York firm, Charles E. Merrill &#x0026; Co. While the 
                            Brantwood Edition did not prove very profitable, it did pay royalties to the author 
                            and upheld Ruskin's expectations for quality of bookmaking; and the arrangement provided the foundation 
                            for the attempt, ultimately hapless, by Allen the Merrill Company to arrive at mutually satisfactory terms 
                            for producing and marketing an "honest Ruskin" edition in the U.S. 
                            (see Maidment, "John Ruskin, George Allen, and American Pirated Books", 10, 15-16).</p>
                        
                        <p>As Dearden remarks, each of the Brantwood Edition volumes carried an introduction by Charles Eliot Norton, 
                            with the sole exception of Poems (Dearden, "The Library Edition", 52). Probably, no prefatory remarks were needed, 
                            since Poems was a new work with an introduction of its own by Collingwood, as opposed to the older works making up 
                            most of the twenty-two volumes of the edition, which gained value by Norton's commentary, lending a boost against competition by the cheap American piracies.</p></div>

                        By the <date notBefore="1890" notAfter="1899">1890s</date>, the privately printed and distributed <date when="1850">1850</date> edition of the <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> had taken on a talismanic aura for rare book collectors, 
                        and <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> inevitably justified the purposes of the <date when="1891">1891</date> edition in part by appealing to the &#x201C;no idle curiosity . . .  that prompts the admirers 
                        of Mr. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s works to collect his boyish writings and to learn the story of his youth.&#x201D;. But he also denies playing to this audience, 
                        arguing that Ruskin is "misunderstood by the casual reader" etc. (v-vi).
                    </p>
                    <p>In his editorial rationale, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>, admitted that the poems&#x02BC; &#x201C;author himself has never brought them forward,&#x201D; 
                        it being &#x201C;impossible for him to offer his own juvenile productions as examples of the lofty ideal he preached&#x201D; in his attempt to elevate 
                        &#x201C;the public taste in poetry as well as art&#x201D; (a half truth, since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did occasionally quote from his juvenilia, 
                        with precisely the purpose of showing that they adumbrated his ideals). <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>, however, was determined to shape the corpus 
                        of early writing in favor of the &#x201C;sonorous line and noble thought&#x201D;, the &#x201C;genuine feeling and fine, enthusiastic description&#x201D;. 
                        Without expurgating irony and fun, <persName corresp="#WGC">the editor</persName> felt obliged to present the consistency of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        &#x201D;ways, and aims, and attitude&#x201D;&#x2014;conditions that &#x201D;in his case, more than with&#x201D; other writers, were &#x201D;determined at an early age, 
                        and illustrated in his early writings. That is the recurrent burden of his autobiography:&#x2014;&#x2018;I find in myself nothing whatsoever <hi rend="italic">changed</hi>&#x2019;&#x201D;

                    <p>Although printed in the back of volume 1 like an appendix, the &#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#POEMS8D1891">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [8<hi rend="super">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>, 1:261&#x2013;67;

                        probably reflects in its title the accurate relation of the "Note" to the remainder of the edition. As a "preliminary" effort, the descriptive bibliography dates at least in part to 1889 or earlier, 
                        on the evidence of the binding history of MS XI. In the "Note," Collingwood describes MS XI as "an envelope containing loose papers," 
                        whereas in its present state this manuscript is bound in several volumes. These bindings originated in 1889 at the latest, although the physical and documentary evidence is obscured and somewhat muddled 
                        (see MS XI: Description). Thus, while Collingwood apparently failed to revise his "Note" to reflect ongoing efforts respecting the manuscripts' preservation and provenance--efforts that may 
                        have been beyond his ken (see Provenance of Early Manuscripts at Denmark Hill and Brantwood)--the "Note" does record a "preliminary" stage of the editorial project. And this makes sense, 
                        as the note's stated purpose is to justify the chronology that Collingwood used to arrange the edition: "After some study of these ancient Codices, . . . the Editor has been able to disentangle their contents 
                        and to arrange them in chronological order; which it may be worth while to note here, both for the assistance of future students, and in jusification of the hypothetical dates assigned to some of the poems"

                    <p>Wise. In particular, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> was indebted to the collector, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="wise_t_j_note.php">Thomas J. Wise (1859&#x2013;1937)</ref>,
