                    <persName corresp="#GA">Allen</persName> was pursuing art studies there to augment his developing reputation as a
                    skilled joiner and carpenter, and his abilities so sufficiently impressed <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>
                    <!--Correction needed here?--> that he was picked as an assistant drawing master.
                    His skill in engraving <!--Entry needed here.-->. <persName corresp="#GA">Allen</persName> became <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s personal
                    assistant in <!--Entry needed here.-->, turning down offers from <persName corresp="#WM">William Morris</persName> as a
                    founding member for furniture design in <orgName corresp="#MORRISCO"><persName corresp="#WM">Morris</persName>, <persName corresp="#CM">Marshall</persName>, <persName corresp="#CFAULKNER">Faulkner</persName> and Company</orgName>, and
                    <!--Entry needed here.--> for care of furnishings in the Queen&#x02BC;s household.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#GA">Allen</persName>&#x02BC;s devotion to his &#x201C;Master&#x201D; (upheld
                    despite periodic strains caused by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s violent outbursts in
                    times of illness) combined well with his shrewd business sense to enable him to
                    realize <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s experiments in publishing and bookselling while
                    remaining profitable. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> aimed to bypass the complex system of discounts
                    that growing up between publishers and trade as a result of cheaper printing
                    methods, widening of the reading public (including demands
                    for &#x201C;self&#x2010;culture&#x201D; by the working classes), and
                    competing influences of the subscription libraries and booksellers. All this
                    encouraged dissemination of &#x201C;cheap classics&#x201D; without
                    regard, in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s paternalistic view, for felt sacrifice in
                    obtaining value both in content and the physical quality of a book, or for fair
                    royalties to authors supporting new writing (although later, by <date when="1882">1882</date>, <persName corresp="#GA">Allen</persName>
                    eased <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s resistance to inexpensive editions of his works).
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> proposed establishing the same consistent and open prices for trade and
                    public alike, providing fair return to both author and publisher (<persName corresp="#GA">Allen</persName> agreed
                    with <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> for a third of profits, which continued after <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s
                    death) while exposing any additional price added by a middleman.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> laid out these principles in <hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi>
                    ([1871&#x2013;<!--Entry needed here.-->]; see, e.g., <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title> <!--Entry needed here.-->),
                    inaugurating them with the monthly publication of those pamphlets as well as
                    with the Works Series. <persName corresp="#GA">Allen</persName> printed and distributed the pamphlets from his home
                    in <placeName corresp="#KENT">Kent</placeName>, first at Heathfield Cottage, <placeName corresp="#KESTON">Keston</placeName>, and then, from <date when="1874">1874</date> as the
                    business grew, at <placeName type="building" corresp="#SUNNYSIDE">Sunnyside</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#ORPINGTON">Orpington</placeName>&#x2014;the familiar imprint for
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s part&#x2010;publications throughout the <date notBefore="1870" notAfter="1879">1870s</date> and <date notBefore="1880" notAfter="1889">1880s</date>.
                    At first, the pastoral village setting, while charming to both <!--Correction needed here?-->
                    <persName corresp="#GA">Allen</persName> and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s sense of the place of
                    handcraftsmanship in English life, caused practical difficulties that the
                    cosmopolitan London book trade was swift to ridicule. But <!--Entry needed here.--></p>
                <p>Through contentious negotiations with <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER"><persName corresp="#GS">Smith</persName> and <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName></orgName>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s
                    publisher through <date when="1871">1871</date> (including, initially, joint responsibility with <persName corresp="#GA">Allen</persName>
                    for <hi rend="italic">Fors</hi>), <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> finally obtained in <!--Entry needed here.--> copyright of
                    his earlier works and, in <date when="1878">1878</date>, purchase of engraved plates. For <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, the
                    relations with <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER"><persName corresp="#GS">Smith</persName> and <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName></orgName> were painfully bound up with relations with his
                    father, who until his death had managed his son&#x02BC;s publishing
                    affairs. Despite bitter emotions that colored the negotiations, the decision to
                    transfer all his titles to <persName corresp="#GA">Allen</persName> proved sound.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#GA">Allen</persName>&#x02BC;s alertness to the market assured that steady sales of
                   <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s works benefited both himself, who by terms of an <date when="1887">1887</date>
                    agreement reaped a third of profits, and the <placeName corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName> circle, who received <!--Entry needed here.-->.
                    <persName corresp="#GA">Allen</persName> frequently complained about <!--Entry needed here.-->. His early skill in engraving drew him to
                    producing fine editions, although he was keenly conscious the full spectrum of
                    the market for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s works. Attention to both ends of the market
                    decided the dual format of works important to the publication history of
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s juvenile work, which <persName corresp="#GA">Allen</persName> exploited in order to expand his
                    list while operating under the unusual condition of serving, at first, as a
                    single&#x2010;author publisher. <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> (<date when="1891">1891</date>), <hi

                       Poetry of Architecture</hi> (<!--Entry needed here.-->) were all issued in both fine and cheap
                    editions. Before his death in <date when="1907">1907</date>, <persName corresp="#GA">Allen</persName> oversaw production and release of
                    several volumes of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> (<date notBefore="1903" notAfter="1912">1903&#x2013;12</date>), the first two
                    volumes containing <hi rend="italic">Early Prose</hi> (vol. 1 [<!--Entry needed here.-->]) and <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi
                        rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> (vol. 2 [<date when="1903">1903</date>]) and incorporating
                    <persName corresp="#GA">Allen</persName> and <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s earlier editions of early
                    works.</p>
                <p>Fine editions were limited and printed on handmade paper <!--Entry needed here.-->.</p>
                <p>Cheap editions were inaugurated in <date when="1882">1882</date> with the Uniform Edition in dark green or
                    reddish brown cloth, <!--Entry needed here.--> by <!--Entry needed here.--> inches, with gilt lettering on the spine. A typical
                    price was 5 shillings, up to 7/6 for longer or illustrated works. Starting in
                    <!--Entry needed here.-->, reissue was frequently from stereotype.</p>
                <p>The concern became <persName corresp="#GA">George Allen</persName> and Sons in <date when="1902">1901</date>, with <persName corresp="#GA">Allen</persName>&#x02BC;s
                    children <persName corresp="#ALLENW">William</persName>, <persName corresp="#ALLENH">Hugh</persName>, and <persName corresp="#ALLENG">Grace</persName> (long active in the business) joining the
                    board. With <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> sales slowing, <persName corresp="#GA">Allen</persName> sought to expand his list with other
                    offers; however, after his death in <date when="1907">1907</date>, slow sales <!--Correction needed here.--> of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>
                    and the inadequate list <!--Correction needed here.--> apart from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> proved a drag on the business.
                    Efforts to expand occurred in <date when="1909">1909</date> with acquisition of the publishing branch of
                    <orgName corresp="#BEMROSESONS">Bemrose and Sons</orgName> and, in <date when="1911">1911</date>, of <orgName corresp="#SWANSONNENSCHEIN">Swan Sonnenschein &#x0026; Company</orgName>, creating
                    <orgName corresp="#GEORGEALLEN">George Allen &#x0026; Company, Ltd</orgName>. The collapsed in <date when="1913">1913</date>, however, and went
                    into receivership under <persName corresp="#SUNWIN">Stanley Unwin</persName> (<!--Entry needed here.-->), who formed <orgName corresp="#ALLENUNWIN">George Allen &#x0026;
                    Unwin</orgName> in <date when="1914">1914</date>. That company continued for a while to issue remaining unbound
                    stock in the Uniform Edition, sometimes with <orgName corresp="#ALLENUNWIN">George Allen &#x0026; Unwin</orgName>
                    imprinted on the spine, but high costs and uncertainties of the market in the
                    war years prevented new reprints of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#SUNWIN">Unwin</persName> later declared he was hampered by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s literary trustees,
                    whose ownership of plates and blocks constrained him to a commission basis for
                    reprints. By terms of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s will, <persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName>, one of
                    the trustees, maintained control over sales of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s works.</p>
