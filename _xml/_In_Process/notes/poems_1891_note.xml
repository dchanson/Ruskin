                <p>The Poems of John Ruskin, edited by <!-- refs to biographical note as well as persName tags -->W. G. Collingwood, 
                    was published by George Allen in 1891. The two-volume edition was released in the two forms that, by then, 
                    Allen had established on a plan that was profitable while remaining true to Ruskin's ideas for fair trade in making books and in selling and distributing them. 
                    On the one hand, Allen made the Poems available as a title in the inexpensive but sturdy and serviceable Uniform Edition--each volume, five by seven-and-a-half inches; 
                    green or brown cloth-covered boards; elegant and legible typeface and font; and the generous proportioning of white space in the margins to the text area, 
                    a point on which Ruskin insisted, and which eventually became an industry standard. For all this, one paid ten shillings for the two volumes. 
                    On the other hand, Allen produced a deluxe edition for collectors, lavishing his craftsman's love for fine bookmaking on what a 1900 advertisement described as 
                    "a Large Edition, with 23 Illustrations in Photogravure from Drawings by the Author and Facsimiles of MSS. Medium 4to", priced at thirty shillings for the two volumes 
                    (see Dawson, The People's Ruskin, 7-9, ii). Even consumers of the Uniform Edition volumes were treated to a few manuscript facsimiles, however, 
                    perhaps because Ruskin's handwriting was key to Collingwood's arguments about dating the poems.</p>

                    By the <date notBefore="1890" notAfter="1899">1890s</date>, the privately printed and distributed <date when="1850">1850</date> edition of the <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> had taken on a talismanic aura for rare book collectors, 
                    and <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> inevitably justified the purposes of the <date when="1891">1891</date> edition in part by appealing to the &#x201C;no idle curiosity . . .  that prompts the admirers 
                    of Mr. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s works to collect his boyish writings and to learn the story of his youth.&#x201D;. But he also denies playing to this audience, 
                    arguing that Ruskin is "misunderstood by the casual reader" etc. (v-vi).
                </p>
                <p>In his editorial rationale, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>, admitted that the poems&#x02BC; &#x201C;author himself has never brought them forward,&#x201D; 
                    it being &#x201C;impossible for him to offer his own juvenile productions as examples of the lofty ideal he preached&#x201D; in his attempt to elevate 
                    &#x201C;the public taste in poetry as well as art&#x201D; (a half truth, since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did occasionally quote from his juvenilia, 
                    with precisely the purpose of showing that they adumbrated his ideals). <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>, however, was determined to shape the corpus 
                    of early writing in favor of the &#x201C;sonorous line and noble thought&#x201D;, the &#x201C;genuine feeling and fine, enthusiastic description&#x201D;. 
                    Without expurgating irony and fun, <persName corresp="#WGC">the editor</persName> felt obliged to present the consistency of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    &#x201D;ways, and aims, and attitude&#x201D;&#x2014;conditions that &#x201D;in his case, more than with&#x201D; other writers, were &#x201D;determined at an early age, 
                    and illustrated in his early writings. That is the recurrent burden of his autobiography:&#x2014;&#x2018;I find in myself nothing whatsoever <hi rend="italic">changed</hi>&#x2019;&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>, 1:xx&#x2013;xxi, xxviii, xx; and 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS8D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [8<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>, 1:vii, xv, vi; and see

                <p>Although printed in the back of volume 1 like an appendix, the &#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#POEMS8D1891">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [8<hi rend="super">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>, 1:261&#x2013;67;

                    probably reflects in its title the accurate relation of the "Note" to the remainder of the edition. As a "preliminary" effort, the descriptive bibliography dates at least in part to 1889 or earlier, 
                    on the evidence of the binding history of MS XI. In the "Note," Collingwood describes MS XI as "an envelope containing loose papers," 
                    whereas in its present state this manuscript is bound in several volumes. These bindings originated in 1889 at the latest, although the physical and documentary evidence is obscured and somewhat muddled 
                    (see MS XI: Description). Thus, while Collingwood apparently failed to revise his "Note" to reflect ongoing efforts respecting the manuscripts' preservation and provenance--efforts that may 
                    have been beyond his ken (see Provenance of Early Manuscripts at Denmark Hill and Brantwood)--the "Note" does record a "preliminary" stage of the editorial project. And this makes sense, 
                    as the note's stated purpose is to justify the chronology that Collingwood used to arrange the edition: "After some study of these ancient Codices, . . . the Editor has been able to disentangle their contents 
                    and to arrange them in chronological order; which it may be worth while to note here, both for the assistance of future students, and in jusification of the hypothetical dates assigned to some of the poems" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#POEMS8D1891">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [8<hi rend="super">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>, 1:???;

                <p>Wise. In particular, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> was indebted to the collector, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="wise_t_j_note.php">Thomas J. Wise (1859&#x2013;1937)</ref>, 
                    of whose &#x201C;full account of the published poems&#x201D; in the

                    <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> &#x201C;gladly availed&#x201D; himself (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>,

                    1:268). <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> was therefore to some degree influenced by <persName corresp="#TJW">Wise</persName>&#x02BC;s manipulation of the bibliographical record in favor of juvenile poems 
                    that <persName corresp="#TJW">Wise</persName> could forge in the form of &#x201C;rare&#x201D; pamphlets (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WISERUSKINI">Dearden, &#x201C;Wise and Ruskin I&#x201D;</ref>, 46&#x2013;47; 
                    and <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="forgery_and_piracy_note.php">Forgery and Piracy</ref>).</p>
                <p>In this instance, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> avows his responsibility&#x2014;&#x201C;the very few emendations I have presumed to make 
                are marked by square brackets&#x201D;&#x2014;and while he tended to be much more casual than a twenty&#x2010;first&#x2010;century editor would be 
                about what emendations needed flagging, we probably can safely assume that these aesthetic &#x201C;emendations&#x201D; were his, and not specifically authorized 
                by the elderly <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>. In his notes and prefaces to the edition, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> always refers 
                to the author&#x02BC;s investment in the edition in the past tense, as having authorized the editor&#x02BC;s judgments but resigned his own responsibility, 
                consistent with <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s general statement that closes his
