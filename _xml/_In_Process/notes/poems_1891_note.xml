                        <p>Sporadic evidence suggests that plans for publication of the poems developed over a number of years. 
                            Presumably, from <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s standpoint, his father&#x02bc;s private publication of <!-- ref to note plus title tag--><ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1850_note.php"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> by <persName corresp="JR">J.

                            any perceived need for further collecting of the poem. Ironically, it was the existence of that private publication that, 
                            because of its rarity and growing interest as a collector&#x02bc;s item, prompted the American publisher 
                            <orgName corresp="JWILEY">John Wiley &#x0026; Sons</orgName> in <date when="1882">1882</date> to compile an unauthorized edition, 
                            <!-- title tag --><title type="book" corresp="JRPOEMS1886"><hi rend="italic">Poems by John Ruskin</hi></title> &#x201c;collected and edited&#x201d; 
                            by <persName corresp="JOWRIGHT">John Osborne Wright</persName> from texts originally published in the annuals. The wording of the title page was clearly designed 
                            to evoke the sought&#x2010;after Poems by <persName corresp="JR">J. R.</persName> &#x201c;collected | <date when="1850">1850</date>&#x201d;; and its preface highlighted the rising desirability of the <date when="1850">1850</date> volume 
                            in the rare&#x2010;book market, where &#x201c;copies have become virtually inaccessible except to the most rabid bibliomaniac, 
                            whose heavy purse enables him to successfully outbid competitors in the auction room and bookstore&#x201d;. 
                            A footnote pointed to the sale of copy in <placeName corresp="LONDON">London</placeName> two years earlier for 41 guineas 
                            <!-- biblioigraphy -->(<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRPOEM1886"><title type="book" corresp="JRPOEMS1886"><hi rend="italic">Poems by John Ruskin</hi></title>, ed. <persName corresp="JOWRIGHT">Osborne</persName></ref>, pp. i, iv). 
                            Certainly, the <persName corresp="JOWRIGHT">Osborne</persName> edition constituted a response the phenomenon of 
                            <!-- ref to note --><ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.php">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</ref>. 
                            However disingenuously, <persName corresp="JOWRIGHT">Osborne</persName>&#x02bc;s preface conveys an impression that the edition was justified a public service, 
                            by bringing a rare and expensive resource within reach of the common reader.</p>
                        
                        <p><persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> reacted aggressively to counter what he perceived as piracy, but his reaction was complicated by his ambivalence toward his early writings. 
                            Writing in <date when="1882">1882</date> to <ref type="note" target="wedderburn_note.php"><persName corresp="AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName></ref>, he fumed&#x2014;less at piratical practices by American publishers and at the opportunistic reprint trade 
                            by English publishers, which increasingly worried <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="allen_george_note.php"><persName corresp="GA">George Allen</persName></ref> (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DAWSONGEORGEALLENOFSUNNYSIDE"><persName corresp="PDAWSON">Dawson</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="DAWSONGEORGEALLENOFSUNNYSIDE"><hi rend="italic">George Allen of Sunnyside</hi></title></ref>, 22, 25-26)&#x2014;and more at English law, 
                            half&#x2010;playfully holding <persName corresp="AW">Wedderburn</persName> personally responsible for his profession as a barrister: &#x201c;what a beast British law is! 
                            I'm obliged to print these&#x2014;at least a lot out of&#x2014;these idiotisms&#x2014;because another fellow&#x2014;a blackguard&#x2014;called Wily! [punning on Wiley&#x02bc;s name]&#x2014;has

                            To <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> literary piracy was mere theft, whether at home or abroad, another way in which authors were denied 
                            fair pay in the tangled system of book dealing, from which he had attempted to extricate his work by setting up <persName corresp="GA">Allen</persName> as his personal publisher. 
                            As <persName corresp="BEM">Brian Maidment</persName> has argued, however, <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin's</persName> seemingly personalized complaints were more broadly polemical 
                            than the resigned reaction of some other British writers to American piracy 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MAIDMENTPIRATEDBOOKS"><persName corresp="BEM">Maidment</persName>, <title corresp="MAIDMENTPIRATEDBOOKS">&#x201c;John Ruskin, George Allen, and American Pirated Books&#x201d;</title></ref>, 7-8). 
                            As <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> states in his letter, the <orgName corresp="JWILEY">Wiley</orgName> edition presented a &#x201c;libel&#x201d; combined with a theft, 
                            meaning that he was embarrassed by inadequate copyright law that compelled him to protect his property as a writer, 
                            while disowning the quality of the poems as &#x201c;idiotisms&#x201d;. With only seeming irrelevance, the letter goes on to call out <persName corresp="AW">Wedderburn</persName> 
                            for &#x201c;your profession&#x201d; for &#x201c;mak[ing] <hi rend="underline">me</hi> pay 300 pounds for calling Whistler a coxcomb!&#x201d;&#x2014;referring 
                            to <persName corresp="JAMW">J. A. M. Whistler</persName>&#x02bc;s <date when="1878">1878</date> libel case against <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> for the critic&#x02bc;s disparaging comments about 
                            Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket (<date when="1875">1875</date>), a case in which the artist won 
                            only a pyrrhic victory of a farthing in damages, while the artist plaintiff and critic defendant had to split court costs 
                            (Ruskin to A. Wedderburn, <date when="1882-02-07">7 February 1882</date>, in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ALSJRTOAW">Ruskin ALS to Alexander Dundas Ogilvy Wedderburn, <date notBefore="1874" notAfter="1888">1874&#x2013;1888</date></ref>; 
                            an unknown hand docketed this letter &#x201c;83&#x201d; in pencil above <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s &#x201c;82&#x201d; for the year).</p>
                        
                        <p><persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s mercurial analogy equates the American painter&#x02bc;s coxcomb &#x201c;impudence&#x201d; of &#x201c;flinging a pot of paint in the public face&#x201d; 
                            with the &#x201c;blackguard&#x201d; wiliness of the American publisher scooping up <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s unprotected property and tossing it 
                            into an overheated book market, which its editor pretends to disparage while capitalizing on the exaggerated prices surrounding <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s poems. 
                            <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> leaves unsaid whether it is the edition or the poems themselves that constitute a &#x201c;libel&#x201d; on his reputation. 
                            Would he have conceded the logic of <persName corresp="JAMW">Whistler</persName>&#x02bc;s self&#x2010;defense that the pricing of any portion of his work ought to be calibrated according to the artist&#x02bc;s 
                            &#x201c;knowledge of a lifetime&#x2012d;? Given the biographical approach that <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="collingwood_w_g_note.php"><persName corresp="WGC">Collingwood</persName></ref> would adopt in his preface to his own edition of the Poems, 
                            <persName corresp="JAMW">Whistler</persName>&#x02bc;s argument seems supported by the value <persName corresp="WGC">Collingwood</persName> places on juvenilia for its &#x201c;peculiar interest&#x201d; as a witness to &#x201c;development&#x201d; and &#x201c;growth&#x201d;

                            but <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="collingwood_w_g_note.php"><persName corresp="WGC">Collingwood</persName></ref>&#x02bc;s edition played little part. Although published in the year of the International Copyright Act (&#x201c;Chace Act&#x201d;), 
                            the <date when="1891">1891</date> Poems did not profit by the agreement, which applied only to new works published after <date when="1891">1891</date>. 
                            Nonetheless, <persName corresp="WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02bc;s edition was published in the <placeName corresp="USA">U.S.</placeName> legally, as part of the &#x201c;Brantwood Edition&#x201d; of <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s works, 
                            which was produced under an agreement with the <placeName corresp="NEW YORK">New York</placeName> firm, <orgName corresp="#MERRILLCO">Charles E. Merrill &#x0026; Co.</orgName> While the 
                            Brantwood Edition did not prove very profitable, it did pay royalties to the author 
                            while upholding <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s expectations for quality of bookmaking. This venture provided the foundation 
                            for <persName corresp="GA">Allen</persName>&#x02bc;s subsequent attempts to arrive at mutually satisfactory terms with the <orgName corresp="#MERRILLCO">Merrill Company</orgName> 
                            for producing and marketing an &#x201c;honest Ruskin&#x201d; edition in the <placeName corresp="USA">U.S.</placeName>, but which led only to suspicion and grievance on both sides 
                            (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibligraphy.php#MAIDMENTPIRATEDBOOKS"><persName corresp="BEM">Maidment</persName>, <title corresp="MAIDMENTPIRATEDBOOKS">&#x201c;John Ruskin, George Allen, and American Pirated Books&#x201d;</title></ref>).</p>
                        
                        <p>As <persName corresp="JSD">Dearden</persName> remarks, each of the Brantwood Edition volumes carried an introduction by <persName corresp="CEN">Charles Eliot Norton</persName>, 
                            with the sole exception of <title type="book" corresp="POEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EARDEBNLIBRARYEDITION"><persName corresp="JSD">Dearden</persName>, <title corresp="EARDENLIBRARYEDITION">&#x201c;The Library Edition&#x201d;</title></ref>, 52). Probably, no prefatory remarks were needed, 
                            since <title type="book" corresp="POEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> was a new work with an introduction of its own by <persName corresp="WGC">Collingwood</persName>, as opposed to the older works making up 
                            most of the twenty&#x2010;two volumes of the Brantwood Edition, which it was hoped would gain renewed value through Norton's commentary, 
                            helping to justify its price against competition by the cheap American piracies.</p>
                        
                        <p>According to <persName corresp="BEM">Maidment</persName>, the first book by <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> that <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="allen_george_note.php"><persName corresp="GA">Allen</persName></ref> succeeded in bringing out in full compliance with the strenuous regulations

                        By the <date notBefore="1890" notAfter="1899">1890s</date>, the privately printed and distributed <date when="1850">1850</date> edition of the <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> had taken on a talismanic aura for rare book collectors, 
                        and <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> inevitably justified the purposes of the <date when="1891">1891</date> edition in part by appealing to the &#x201C;no idle curiosity . . .  that prompts the admirers 
                        of Mr. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s works to collect his boyish writings and to learn the story of his youth.&#x201D;. But he also denies playing to this audience, 
                        arguing that Ruskin is "misunderstood by the casual reader" etc. (v-vi).
                    </p>
                    <p>In his editorial rationale, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>, admitted that the poems&#x02BC; &#x201C;author himself has never brought them forward,&#x201D; 
                        it being &#x201C;impossible for him to offer his own juvenile productions as examples of the lofty ideal he preached&#x201D; in his attempt to elevate 
                        &#x201C;the public taste in poetry as well as art&#x201D; (a half truth, since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did occasionally quote from his juvenilia, 
                        with precisely the purpose of showing that they adumbrated his ideals). <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>, however, was determined to shape the corpus 
                        of early writing in favor of the &#x201C;sonorous line and noble thought&#x201D;, the &#x201C;genuine feeling and fine, enthusiastic description&#x201D;. 
                        Without expurgating irony and fun, <persName corresp="#WGC">the editor</persName> felt obliged to present the consistency of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        &#x201D;ways, and aims, and attitude&#x201D;&#x2014;conditions that &#x201D;in his case, more than with&#x201D; other writers, were &#x201D;determined at an early age, 
                        and illustrated in his early writings. That is the recurrent burden of his autobiography:&#x2014;&#x2018;I find in myself nothing whatsoever <hi rend="italic">changed</hi>&#x2019;&#x201D;

                        probably reflects in its title the accurate relation of the "Note" to the remainder of the edition. As a "preliminary" effort, the descriptive bibliography dates at least in part to 1889 or earlier, 
                        on the evidence of the binding history of MS XI. In the "Note," Collingwood describes MS XI as "an envelope containing loose papers," 
                        whereas in its present state this manuscript is bound in several volumes. These bindings originated in 1889 at the latest, although the physical and documentary evidence is obscured and somewhat muddled 
                        (see MS XI: Description). Thus, while Collingwood apparently failed to revise his "Note" to reflect ongoing efforts respecting the manuscripts' preservation and provenance--efforts that may 
                        have been beyond his ken (see Provenance of Early Manuscripts at Denmark Hill and Brantwood)--the "Note" does record a "preliminary" stage of the editorial project. And this makes sense, 
                        as the note's stated purpose is to justify the chronology that Collingwood used to arrange the edition: "After some study of these ancient Codices, . . . the Editor has been able to disentangle their contents 
                        and to arrange them in chronological order; which it may be worth while to note here, both for the assistance of future students, and in jusification of the hypothetical dates assigned to some of the poems" 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#POEMS8D1891">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [8<hi rend="super">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>, 1:???;

                        <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> &#x201C;gladly availed&#x201D; himself (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>,

                        1:268). <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> was therefore to some degree influenced by <persName corresp="#TJW">Wise</persName>&#x02BC;s manipulation of the bibliographical record in favor of juvenile poems 
                        that <persName corresp="#TJW">Wise</persName> could forge in the form of &#x201C;rare&#x201D; pamphlets (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WISERUSKINI">Dearden, &#x201C;Wise and Ruskin I&#x201D;</ref>, 46&#x2013;47;

                        about what emendations needed flagging, we probably can safely assume that these aesthetic &#x201C;emendations&#x201D; were his, and not specifically authorized
