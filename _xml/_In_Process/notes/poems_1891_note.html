                    That is, for modest consumers, <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span> made the two volumes available for ten shillings net, in the sturdy and serviceable <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/uniform_edition_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRWORKSUNIFORMEDITION">Uniform Edition</span></a>. 
                    For collectors, <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span> produced a deluxe edition, lavishing his craftsman&#x02BC;s love of fine bookmaking on what a <span class="date-1900">1900</span> advertisement described as 
      &#x201C;a Large Edition, with 23 Illustrations in Photogravure from Drawings by the Author and Facsimiles of MSS. Medium 4to&#x201D;, priced at thirty shillings for the two volumes

            <div class="p">Sporadic evidence suggests that plans for publication of the poems developed over a number of years. 
                            Presumably, from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s standpoint, his father&#x02BC;s private publication of <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/poems_1850_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1850"><i>Poems</i></span> by <span class="persName-JR">J. R.</span> (<span class="date-1850">1850</span>)</a> had long ago brought to a close 
                            any perceived need for further collecting of the poems. Ironically, it was the existence of that private publication that, 
                            because of its rarity and increasing interest as a collector&#x02BC;s item in the final third of the century, prompted the American publisher 
                            John Wiley &#x0026; Sons to release an unauthorized edition, 
                            <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1886"><i>Poems by John Ruskin</i></span>, in <span class="date-1882">1882</span>. 
                            The volume was &#x201C;collected and edited&#x201D; by <span class="persName-JOWRIGHT">John Osborne Wright</span>, 
                            basing his copytext on poems published in the <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/annuals_note.php");?>" target="_self">literay annuals</a>. 
                            The wording of the title page, <i>collected and edited</i>, was clearly designed to evoke the sought&#x2010;after 
                            <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1850"><i>Poems</i></span> by <span class="persName-JR">J. R.</span> &#x201C;collected &#x007C; <span class="date-1850">1850</span>&#x201D;; 
                            and <span class="persName-JOWRIGHT">Wright</span>&#x02BC;s preface highlighted the rising desirability of the <span class="date-1850">1850</span> volume, 
                            while pretending to scoff at the rare&#x2010;book market in which &#x201C;copies have become virtually inaccessible except to the most rabid bibliomaniac, 
                            whose heavy purse enables him to successfully outbid competitors in the auction room and bookstore&#x201D;. 
                            A footnote pointed to the sale of a copy in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> two years earlier for 41 guineas 
                            (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#JRPOEMS1886");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1886"><i>Poems by John Ruskin</i></span>, ed. <span class="persName-JOWRIGHT">Osborne</span></a>, i, iv). 
                            While the <span class="persName-JOWRIGHT">Osborne</span> edition capitalized on the phenomenon of 
                            <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/collecting_of_modern_authors_note.php");?>" target="_self">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</a>, 
                            the book&#x02BC;s preface conveys an impression, however disingenuously, that its piracy was justified as a democratic public service, 
                            by bringing a rare and expensive resource within reach of the common reader.
            </div>
            
            
            <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> reacted aggressively to counter what he recognized as piracy, but his reaction was complicated by his ambivalence toward his early writings. 
                            Writing in <span class="date-1882">1882</span> to <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/wedderburn_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-AW">Alexander Wedderburn</span></a>, he fumed perhaps less about piratical practices by American publishers or about an opportunistic reprint trade 
                            that was simultaneousy pursued by British publishers&#x2014;issues that increasingly worried <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/allen_george_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-GA">George Allen</span></a> 
                            (see <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#DAWSONGEORGEALLENOFSUNNYSIDE");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-PDAWSON">Dawson</span>, <span class="title-book-DAWSONGEORGEALLENOFSUNNYSIDE"><i>George Allen of Sunnyside</i></span></a>, 22, 25&#x2013;26). 
                            Rather, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> at least pretended to be outraged more about English law, 
                            half&#x2010;playfully holding <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> personally responsible for his profession as a barrister: &#x201C;what a beast British law is! 
                            I&#x02BC;m obliged to print these&#x2014;at least a lot out of&#x2014;these idiotisms&#x2014;because another fellow&#x2014;a blackguard&#x2014;called Wily! &#x005B;punning on Wiley&#x02BC;s name&#x005D;&#x2014;has 
                            published them without my leave&#x2014;copyright of &#x005B;the literary annual&#x005D; <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span> being out! Theft &#x0026; libel in one!&#x201D; 
                            To <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, literary piracy was mere theft, whether at home or abroad, another way in which authors were denied 
                            fair pay in the tangled system of book dealing, from which he had attempted to extricate his work by setting up <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span> as his personal publisher. 
                            As <span class="persName-BEM">Brian Maidment</span> has argued, however, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s seemingly personalized complaints were more broadly polemical 
                            than the anger or resignation expressed by other British writers toward American piracy 
                            (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#MAIDMENTPIRATEDBOOKS");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-BEM">Maidment</span>, <span class="title-MAIDMENTPIRATEDBOOKS">&#x201C;John Ruskin, George Allen, and American Pirated Books&#x201D;</span></a>, 7&#x2013;8). 
                            What especially piqued <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> about the Wiley edition was that, as he states in his letter to <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>, 
                            the publication combined theft with a &#x201C;libel&#x201D;, meaning that he disowned the poems as &#x201C;idiotisms&#x201D;, 
                            even as he was compelled to protect his property as a writer, since English copyright law failed to do so on his behalf 
                            (<span class="title-letter-jr_to_aw_1882-02-07">Ruskin to A. Wedderburn</span>, <span class="date-1882-02-07">7 February 1882</span>,

                            an unknown hand docketed this letter &#x201C;83&#x201D; in pencil above <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;82&#x201D; for the year).
            </div>
            
            
            <div class="p">With only seeming irrelevance, the letter goes on to call out <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>

                            (Although <span class="persName-JAMW">Whistler</span> won his suit, the victory was pyrrhic, since he was awarded only a farthing in damages, 
                            while the plaintiff and defendant had to split court costs, which amounted to ??? on Ruskin's part &#x005B;see  
                            (<span class="title-letter-jr_to_aw_1882-02-07">Ruskin to A. Wedderburn</span>, <span class="date-1882-02-07">7 February 1882</span>,

                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s analogy equates what he sees as parallel cases of American chicanery from which English law 
                            failed to protect him&#x2014;the painter&#x02BC;s coxcomb &#x201C;impudence&#x201D; of charging high prices for &#x201C;flinging a pot of paint in the public face&#x201D;, 
                            and the &#x201C;blackguard&#x201D; wiliness of the American publisher scooping up <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s unprotected property and tossing it 
                            into an overheated book market, which the editor pretends to disparage while capitalizing on the exaggerated prices surrounding <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poems. 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> leaves unsaid, however, whether it is the edition or the poems themselves that constitute a &#x201C;libel&#x201D; on his reputation. 
                            Would he have conceded the logic of <span class="persName-JAMW">Whistler</span>&#x02BC;s self&#x2010;defense that the pricing of any portion of his work ought to be calibrated according to the artist&#x02BC;s 
                            &#x201C;knowledge of a lifetime𠄭? It would seem that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> ought to have allowed the point, 
                            given the biographical approach that he later adopted in his preface to his own edition, the <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i></span>, 
                            attributing a &#x201C;peculiar interest&#x201D; to the seemingly worthless juveniia as a witness to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;development&#x201D; and &#x201C;growth&#x201D;

                            Nonetheless, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s edition was published in the <span class="placeName-USA">United States</span> legally, as part of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSBRANTWOODEDITION">Brantwood Edition</span> of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s works, 
                            which was produced under an agreement with the <span class="placeName-NYC">New York</span> firm, Charles E. Merrill &#x0026; Company. While the 
                            <span class="title-book-JRWORKSBRANTWOODEDITION">Brantwood Edition</span> did not prove very profitable, it did pay royalties to the author 
                            while upholding <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s expectations for quality of bookmaking. This venture provided the foundation 
                            for <span class="persName-GA">Allen</span>&#x02BC;s subsequent attempts to arrive at mutually satisfactory terms with the Merrill Company

Probably, no prefatory remarks were needed, 
                            since <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s edition was a new work with an introduction of its own, as opposed to the older works making up

                            It was also hoped that <span class="persName-CEN">Norton</span>&#x02BC;s name on the title pages would persuade consummers to justify the price of the edition, compared with the cheap and widely available American piracies.

            <div class="p">In his editorial rationale, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>, admitted that the poems&#x02BC; &#x201C;author himself has never brought them forward,&#x201D; 
                        it being &#x201C;impossible for him to offer his own juvenile productions as examples of the lofty ideal he preached&#x201D; in his attempt to elevate 
                        &#x201C;the public taste in poetry as well as art&#x201D; (a half truth, since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did occasionally quote from his juvenilia, 
                        with precisely the purpose of showing that they adumbrated his ideals). <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>, however, was determined to shape the corpus 
                        of early writing in favor of the &#x201C;sonorous line and noble thought&#x201D;, the &#x201C;genuine feeling and fine, enthusiastic description&#x201D;. 
                        Without expurgating irony and fun, <span class="persName-WGC">the editor</span> felt obliged to present the consistency of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s

                        and illustrated in his early writings. That is the recurrent burden of his autobiography:&#x2014;&#x2018;I find in myself nothing whatsoever <i>changed</i>&#x2019;&#x201D;

                        probably reflects in its title the accurate relation of the "Note" to the remainder of the edition. As a "preliminary" effort, the descriptive bibliography dates at least in part to 1889 or earlier, 
                        on the evidence of the binding history of MS XI. In the "Note," Collingwood describes MS XI as "an envelope containing loose papers," 
                        whereas in its present state this manuscript is bound in several volumes. These bindings originated in 1889 at the latest, although the physical and documentary evidence is obscured and somewhat muddled 
                        (see MS XI: Description). Thus, while Collingwood apparently failed to revise his "Note" to reflect ongoing efforts respecting the manuscripts' preservation and provenance--efforts that may 
                        have been beyond his ken (see Provenance of Early Manuscripts at Denmark Hill and Brantwood)--the "Note" does record a "preliminary" stage of the editorial project. And this makes sense, 
                        as the note's stated purpose is to justify the chronology that Collingwood used to arrange the edition: "After some study of these ancient Codices, . . . the Editor has been able to disentangle their contents 
                        and to arrange them in chronological order; which it may be worth while to note here, both for the assistance of future students, and in jusification of the hypothetical dates assigned to some of the poems"
