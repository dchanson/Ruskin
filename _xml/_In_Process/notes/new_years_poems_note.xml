                <p>Two occasions that regularly call for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poetry to honor his father 
                    are <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s May 10 birthday and New Year&#x02BC;s. Of the latter kind of occasional poem, 
                    whether inscribed for presentation on New Year&#x02BC;s Eve or on New Year&#x02BC;s Day, the earliest surviving example is 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="time_blank_verse_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTIMEBLANKVERSE">&#x201C;Time: Blank Verse&#x201D;</title></ref>, which is dated ???<!-- ??? --> 
                    (see also <ref type="apparatus" target="the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php#DISCUSSION"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHENEEDLESSALARM">&#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;</title>: Discussion</ref>, 
                    for a poem earlier than <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTIMEBLANKVERSE">&#x201C;Time: Blank Verse&#x201D;</title>, which may have been presented as a New Year&#x02BC;s present, 
                    although it contains no formal features of an occasional poem).</p>

                <p>A likely source for modeling the New Year&#x02BC;s ode, which was available to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in the <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName> library, 
                    was the <ref type="note" target="evangelical_magazine_note.php"><title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title></ref>, 
                    which regularly included New Year&#x02BC;s poems in the &#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; section for the January issue. Starting with the magazine&#x02BC;s volume 1 (<date when="1793">1793</date>), 
                    monthly issues featured a brief one&#x2010; to two&#x2010;page section entitled &#x201C;Poetry&#x201D;, consisting of contributions apparently by readers, signed with initials, aliases, or locations. 
                    These small &#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; sections, which were included in each monthly issue, may have served <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> as a model for his verse anthologies in his 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title></ref>, collections that he entitled &#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; 
                    similarly to the header used for the published collections (see, e.g., 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">MS I Poetry Anthology</title></ref>).</p>
                
                <p>From the beginnings of the magazine, the editors encouraged readers to contribute to all departments, especially with &#x201C;short pieces&#x201D; such as poems 
                    (&#x201C;Preface&#x201D; [<date when="1794-01">January 1794</date>]). Readers responded with verse in a variety of genres&#x2014;descriptive pieces, 
                    elegies, epigraphs, devotional poems, hymns, psalm paraphrases, reflections on Bible verses, doctrinal arguments, &#x201C;thing&#x201D; poems, as well as seasonal poems, including Christmas poems for the December issue, 
                    and New Year&#x02BC;s poems for the January issue. The final issue of volume one (<date when="1793-12">December 1793</date>) featured contributors&#x02BC; poems on the Nativity, 
                    while the opening issue of volume two (<date when="1794-01">January 1794</date>) presented contributors&#x02BC; poems on the New Year; and that pattern was sustained in subsequent volumes, 
                    with poems such as &#x201C;Reflections at the Close of a Year&#x201D; (2 1794 557) also occasionally printed in a December issue. In each annual volume, 
                    the New Year appears to have invited more verse commentary compared to Christmas (and other holy days are rarely celebrated); 
                    and New Year&#x02BC;s poems are often complemented with reflections in prose, as well. For example, in the <date when="1794-01">January 1794</date> issue, 
                    an essay urges readers to solemnize their minds &#x201C;when . . . brought <hi rend="italic">to the close of the year</hi>&#x201D; since, 
                    despite all &#x201C;sagacity&#x201d; one &#x201C;cannot ascertain what events may befal me <hi rend="italic">in the progress of that upon which, at present, I am about to enter!</hi>&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SUITABLEMEDITATIONEVANGELICALMAG1794-01"><title type="essay" corresp="#SUITABLEMEDITATIONEVANGELICALMAG1794-01">&#x201C;Suitable Meditation for the Beginning of the Year&#x201D;</title></ref>, 29).</p>
                
                    <p>The New Year&#x02BC;s poems are religious, like almost all of the poetry published in the magazine, and they tend to develop predictable themes&#x2014;the 
                        shortness of time in which to live a holy life; praise of the <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#CREATOR">Creator</persName> for time and the seasons; 
                        the superiority of spiritual gifts over material holiday presents. . . . 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s New Year&#x02BC;s poems do not typically reflect these religious and admonitory themes.

                    <!-- START NEW MARKUP -->
                    <p>A writer using the pen name <persName corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName>&#x2014;who was among the magazine&#x02BC;s first poets, with contributions to volume one&#x2014;also supplied one its first New Year&#x02BC;s poems, 
                        featured in the January issue of volume 2 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ALIQUISNEWYEAREVANGELICALMAG1794-01"><persName corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName>, <title type="poem" corresp="#ALIQUISNEWYEAREVANGELICALMAG1794-01">&#x201C;The New Year&#x201D;</title></ref>). 
                        <persName corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName> went on to supply a poem for this occasion annually for almost four decades, the poet&#x02BC;s last New Year&#x02BC;s ode being published in <date when="1832">1832</date>. 
                        Earlier New Year&#x02BC;s poems by <persName corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName>, like those contributed by other poets to the January issues, are lyric &#x201C;reflections&#x201D; and &#x201C;thoughts&#x201D; of a speaker, 
                        looking back on shortcomings in the preceding year and resolving to do better in the coming year. Some of these poems stand out from the couplets and quatrains that characterize the mass of contributions, 
                        aspiring to formal complexity with a six&#x2010;line stanza that divides quatrameter rhyming couplets in lines 1&#x2013;2 and 4&#x2013;5 with rhyming trimeter lines 3 and 6. 
                        Then, with the New Year&#x02BC;s poem for <date when="1804">1804</date>&#x2014;notably, the year of the &#x201C;Great Terror&#x201D;, when British citizens watched with horror 
                        as <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName> massed troops and flotilla on the French coast of the <geogName corresp="#ENGLISHCHANNEL">English Channel</geogName>, in preparation for invasion&#x2014;<persName corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName> developed the lyric form of reflection into an ode, consisting of three divisions of thought, 
                        subtitled &#x201C;Reflection&#x201D;, &#x201C;Contrition&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Praise&#x201D;&#x2014;each section distinguished by differing metrical patterns
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ALIQUISODEFORTHENEWYEAREVANGELICALMAG1804-01"><persName corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName>, <title type="poem" corresp="#ALIQUISODEFORTHENEWYEAREVANGELICALMAG1804-01">&#x201C;Ode for the New Year&#x201D;</title></ref>; 
                        see <!-- TITLE AND LINK TO APPARATUS --><ref type="apparatus" target="the_defiance_of_war_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEDEFIANCEOFWAR">&#x201C;The Defiance of War&#x201D;</title></ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p>From here, <persName corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName> goes on to produce New Year&#x02BC;s odes for every January issue, most of them in this ambitious multipart format. Accordingly, 
                        for those Januarys, <persName corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName>&#x02BC;s odes either filled the entirety of the magazine&#x02BC;s normally modest one&#x2010; to two&#x2010;page monthly allotment to poetry 
                        or they burst the January poetry sections to take up several pages in order to allow for contributions by others, as well. 
                        Presumably, in order to have been showcased on this scale, <persName corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName>&#x02BC;s niche performance was welcomed as a holiday tradition by the magazine&#x02BC;s editors and readers. 
                        Thus, while nothing is known of <persName corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName>&#x02BC;s identity, this poet&#x02BC;s career perhaps presents an example of an amateur poet of moderate skill who achieved modest fame within a pious and respectable circle&#x2014;a 
                        possible way of viewing <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s career if he had stayed on his path of writing verse for the annuals.</p>

                <p>Typically the poems contained a New Year&#x02BC;s greeting, but

                    topic to the holiday may have been understood only by the family.</p>
                <p>One possible model for this practice was the Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s
