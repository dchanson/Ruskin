                <head type="title">New Year&#x02BC;s Poems</head>
                <p>The two occasions that inspire poetry early in the Ruskin juvenilia and recur faithfully thoughout 
                    are John James Ruskin's May 10 birthday and New Year&#x02BC;s. Of the latter kind of occasional poem, 
                    whether inscribed for presentation on New Year's Eve or on New Year's Day, the earliest surviving example is 
                    <!-- title and link to apparatus -->&#x201C;Time: Blank Verse&#x201D;, which is dated ??? 
                    (see also <!-- title and link to apparatus: discussioi -->&#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;: Discussion, 
                    for a poem earlier than "Time: Blank Verse", which may have been presented as a New Year's present, 
                    although it contains no formal features of an occasional ode).</p>
                
                <p>A likely model for the New Year's ode, which was available to Ruskin in the Herne Hill library, 
                    was the <!-- title and link to note -->Evangelical Magazine, 
                    which regularly included New Year's poems in the "Poetry" section for the January issue. Starting with the magazine's volume 1 (1793), 
                    monthly issues featured a brief one- to two-page section, "Poetry", consisting largely of contributions by readers, signed with initials or aliases. 
                    (The header for this section may have served Ruskin as a model for the "Poetry" anthologies in his Red Books: see . . . ) 
                    Reader contributions in all departments were encouraged by the editors--"Short pieces will generally be most satisfactory" 
                    ("Preface" [January 1794])--and the supplementary issue ending volume 1 duly carried contributors' poems on the Nativity. 
                    For the following January issue of volume 2 (1794), contributors supplied poems on the New Year. Their themes, praising the Creator for time and the seasons, 
                    and arguing the superiority of spiritual gifts over holiday presents, are more cheerful than a harangue in prose on the shortness of life, 
                    which features in the main body of the issue, urging the reader to solemnize one's mind 
                    "when . . . brought <hi rend="italic">to the close of the year</hi>; and [when], with all my sagacity, 
                    cannot ascertain what events may befal me <hi rend="italic">in the progress of that upon which, at present, I am about to enter!</hi> 
                    (Aliquis, "The New Year"; L.T., "New Year's Gifts"; "Suitable Meditation for the Beginning of the Year", 29).</p>
                
                <p>When this family tradition started is uncertain. The earliest poem specifically
                    dated 1 January is . . .<!-- Entry needed here. --> and the earliest poem explicitly connected with New
                    Year&#x02BC;s Day is . . .<!-- Entry needed here. --> &#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D; and
                    MS I as a whole. . . . The MS III Second Poetry Anthology contains at least
                    three New Year&#x02BC;s Poems: &#x201C;Time: Blank Verse,&#x201D;
                    the previous year&#x02BC;s presentation, along with &#x201C;The
                    Sun&#x201D; and &#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D;
                    (&#x201C;Papa how pretty those icicles are&#x201D;). </p>
                <p>Typically the poems contained a New Year&#x02BC;s greeting, but
                    &#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Papa how pretty those
                    icicles are&#x201D;) does not, suggesting that the relevance of a given
                    topic to the holiday may have been understood only by the family.</p>
                <p>One possible model for this practice was the Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s
                    annual, containing light verse and illustration, such as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi>.[When did the family start buying
                    annuals? Point out how anthologies following &#x201C;Harry and
                    Lucy&#x201D; may be imitating this.]<!-- Entry needed here. --> </p>
                <p> For a Scottish family, New Year&#x02BC;s Day . . . (What was the
                    celebration typically? Why New Year&#x02BC;s?) Ruskin would always treat
                    New Year&#x02BC;s as a red&#x2010;letter day connected with writing. . . .<!-- Entry needed here. --></p>
