                    says that <persName corresp="CR">Runciman</persName> &#x201C;tried unsuccessfully for years to attract favourable attention as a painter of landscapes, genre scenes, and historical subjects&#x201D; (9).</p>
                <p><persName corresp="CR">Runciman</persName>&#x02BC;s metier was teaching of perspective (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 261 n. 13), reflected in <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s description of a lesson: &#x201C;I took my paper &#x0026; I fixed my points, 
                    &#x0026; I drew my perspective, &#x0026; then as Mr <persName corresp="CR">Runciman</persName> bid me, I began to invent a scene&#x201D;. 
                    Working within this method, <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> constructed a scene by means of what he termed &#x201C;patch[ing] . . . together&#x201D;: &#x201C;I examined one of <persName corresp="MRC">Mary</persName>&#x02BC;s pictures, 
                    to see how the rocks were done, &#x0026; then another to see how the woods were done, &#x0026; another to see how the moutains were done, 
                    and another to see how the cottages were done, and I patched them all together, &#x0026; I made such a lovely scene&#x201d; (<ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1832-02-20_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_jjr_1832-02-20">letter of <date when="1832-02-20">20 February 1832</date></title></ref> [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 262&#x2013;63]). 
                    Although <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> expected to be scolded for this patchwork approach to invention, but the master&#x02BC;s response was that &#x2018;patch[ing] up . . . was not copying&#x2019;&#x201D;, 
                    and that &#x201C;there was something in&#x201D; <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s picture &#x201C;that would make him totally change the method he had hitherto pursued with me&#x201D;. Forthwith, <persName corresp="CR">Runciman</persName> 
                    instructed <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to use watercolor on grey paper, beginning &#x201C;with a few of the simplest colours, in order to teach me better the effects of light &#x0026; shade&#x201D;. 
                    The aim was &#x201C;to teach me water colour painting, but . . . only as a basis for oil&#x201D; (<ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1832-02-27_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_jjr_1832-02-27">letter of <date when="1832-02-27">27 February 1832</date></title></ref> [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 267].</p>
                <p><persName corresp="PHW">Paul H. Walton</persName> speculates this change in approach signifies that <persName corresp="CR">Runciman</persName> &#x201C;believed that he had encountered a boy who would one day bring lustre to his teacher&#x02BC;s name through his success as a professional 
                    artist in the exhibitions of the <orgName corresp="ROYALACADEMY">Royal Academy</orgName>&#x201D;, but that such ambitions were foiled by the elder <persName corresp="JJR">Ruskins</persName>&#x02BC; plans of a more gentlemanly profession for their son, 
                    for which &#x201C;advanced training in the techniques and materials of art&#x201D; such as oils &#x201C;would introduce an unnecessary and inappropriate degree of specialization&#x201D; (9. 11). 
                    In due course, as <persName corresp="WALTON">Walton</persName> points out, <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> came to dislike oil painting, complaining in an <date when="1835">1835</date> rhymed letter to his father of its smell and messiness. Instead, 
                    &#x201C;<persName corresp="CFARTIST">C. Fielding</persName>s tints alone for me&#x201D;, <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> declared, having begun his lessons with <persName corresp="CFARTIST">Copley Fielding</persName> in this year, the same year in which he appears to have ended 
                    his instruction with <persName corresp="CR">Runciman</persName> (<ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1835-03-11_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_jjr_1835-03-11">letter of <date when="1835-03-11">11 March 1835</date></title></ref> [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 312, and see 261 n. 13, 314 n. 3]). If snobbery about an ungentlemanly dirtying 
                    of one&#x02BC;s hands was a factor in <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s rejection of <persName corresp="CR">Runciman</persName>&#x02BC;s course of instruction, 
                    so was the time involved in &#x201C;some fifty coats to be / Splashed on each spot successively&#x201D; (<ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1835-03-11_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_jjr_1835-03-11">letter of <date when="1835-03-11">11 March 1835</date></title></ref> [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 312]). From the start, however, even when <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> was still 
                    &#x201C;patching together&#x201D; his pictures, the quality that perhaps gained <persName corresp="CR">Runciman</persName>&#x02BC;s attention was a <persName corresp="WW">Wordsworthian</persName> combining of memory and spontaneity. When constructing 
                    his first scene for <persName corresp="CR">Runciman</persName>, <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> was not entirely copying, because he &#x201C;thought . . . [his] model resembled&#x201D; his memory of &#x201C;the cottage that we saw, 
                    as we went to <!--need information on these locations!--><geogName corresp="#RHAEADRDDU">Rhaidyr Dhu</geogName>, near <placeName corresp="#MAENTRWOG">Maentwrog</placeName> where the old woman lived whose grandson went with us to the fall, so very silently&#x201D; (<ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1832-02-20_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_jjr_1832-02-20">letter of <date when="1832-02-20">20 February 1832</date></title></ref> [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 262]); and the 
                    painting that he had in prospect to learn from <persName corresp="CR">Runciman</persName> seemed to <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> a &#x201C;superior&#x201D; art, because he would be able to &#x201C;carry off <geogName corresp="DERWENTWATER">Derwent Water</geogName> &#x0026; <geogName corresp="SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</geogName>
                    in my pocket&#x201D; (<ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1832-02-27_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_jjr_1832-02-27">letter of <date when="1832-02-27">27 February 1832</date></title></ref> [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 268]). When graduating to <persName corresp="CFARTIST">Fielding</persName>&#x02BC;s instruction, <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> was still looking to capture the ephemeral, &#x201C;To sketch the scenes that pass me by&#x201D; in
