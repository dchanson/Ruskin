                <p>It was a wide stretchy sweep of lovely blue champaign,<ref type="gloss_textual" target="it_was_a_wide_and_stretchy_sweep_prose_glosses_textual.php#PLACEMENT" /> richly cultivated 
                    and beautifully wooded, and bounded by magnificent mountain ranges: here 
                    fading away, faint and blue and cloudlike toward the south;<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="it_was_a_wide_and_stretchy_sweep_glosses_contextual.php#SOUTH"/> there distinct 
                    and near and lofty, with the green cultivation climbing up their broad flanks. 
                    I had read that the snowy summit of the <geogName corresp="#MONTTITLIS">Mont Titlis</geogName> was visible from 
                    <placeName corresp="#STRASBOURG">Strasburg</placeName>, the consequence of which marvellous information was, 
                    that I metamorphosed every cloud I saw into a mountain, strained my eyes with looking 
                    for that which was out of sight,<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="it_was_a_wide_and_stretchy_sweep_glosses_contextual.php#TITLIS"/> and had at last very nearly argued myself into 
                    a conviction that blue hills were white ones, until our entrance into the narrow 
                    dell above mentioned precluded all farther observations upon the clouds. A 
                    Swiss cottage is a celebrated thing, celebrated far and wide; it has modelled 
                    the Tivolian villas of&#x2014;<placeName corresp="#HIGHTGATE">Highgate</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#HAMPSTEAD">Hampstead</placeName>,<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="it_was_a_wide_and_stretchy_sweep_glosses_contextual.php#HIGHGATE"/> the mock waterfalls and 
                    crocodile stools of the Coliseum<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="it_was_a_wide_and_stretchy_sweep_glosses_contextual.php#COLISEUM"/> have extended its fame, and much it delighted 
                    me when first the wide projecting wooden roof and carved galleries and 
                    external stairs looked out to greet us from among the dark pines. What 
                    a host of associations and recollections tumbled in upon me. Mountains, 
                    avalanches, glaciers, cottages, <persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName>, vinegar,<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="it_was_a_wide_and_stretchy_sweep_glosses_contextual.php#VINEGAR"/> <persName type="fictional">Tell</persName>, <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>, apples, tyrants, 
                    and crossbows came crowding into my brain, jumbled together in most 
                    admired disorder. I thought of nothing connected the whole day.</p>
