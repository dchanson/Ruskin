                <p>And this is the birthplace of <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName>!<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="cologne_glosses_contextual.php#RUBENSBIRTHPLACEGLOSS"/> Sink these French bad roads. 
                    <lb/>A long day&#x02BC;s journey over them under a burning sun, together with a 
                    <lb/>perambulation on a damp evening at <placeName corresp="#AIXLACHAPELLE">Aix&#x2010;la&#x2010;Chapelle</placeName> so knocked me up 
                    <lb/>that I was forced to diet and quiet it, and could not stir out<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="cologne_glosses_contextual.php#STIROUTGLOSS"/> to see 
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName>&#x02BC; last picture, the masterpiece of the master, the <title type="artwork" corresp="#RUBENSCRUCIFIXIONSTPETER">Crucifixion of 
                    <pb/>
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#STPETER">St. Peter</persName></title>, bequeathed by him at his death to his native city,<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="cologne_glosses_contextual.php#RUBENSSTPETERGLOSS"/> and, yet more, 
                    <lb/>his birth&#x2010;chamber.</p>
                <p>There is in many, in most, of the pictures of <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName>, and that even 
                    <lb/>in his most sacred subjects, magnificent as they are viewed as paintings 
                    <lb/>only, an unholiness, a cast of Bacchanalian revelry, to say the least, an 
                    <lb/>unpleasingness, that does him dishonour.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="cologne_glosses_contextual.php#DISHONOURGLOSS"/> But there are a few, a chosen few, 
                    <lb/>of his pictures which the master hath poured his whole soul into, and the 
                    <lb/>production of one of which were enough to repay a lifetime of labour with 
                    <lb/>immortality. There is a picture, I neither know where it is, nor what it 
                    <lb/>is, but there is a picture curtained up in one of the royal palaces of 
                    <lb/><placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>, the <title type="artwork" corresp="#RUBENSSTAMBROSIUS"><persName corresp="#STAMBROSE">St. Ambrosius</persName></title>, I think, kneeling before a crucifix.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="cologne_glosses_contextual.php#STAMBROSIUSGLOSS"/> There is 
                    <lb/>one single ray of yellow light falling faintly upon the grey hairs and holy 
                    <lb/>features of the venerable saint, the rest is in obscurity; there is nothing more, 
                    <lb/>nothing to disturb either the eye or the mind, and you feel calmed and 
                    <lb/>subdued when you look upon that one solitary figure, as if in the presence 
                    <lb/>of a superior being. It is impossible to see that picture, the reality is 
                    <lb/>too striking, and a reality so hallowed and so beautiful, that when the 
                    <lb/>curtain is again drawn over the picture, you feel as if awaking from a 
                    <lb/>dream of heaven. It is by such pictures as this that <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName> has gained 
                    <lb/>his immortality; and it was, I believe, such a picture as this that I did not 
                    <lb/>see at <placeName corresp="#COLOGNE">Cologne</placeName>. Then the disappointment made me worse, and I could 
                    <lb/>not stir out to see the room in which he was born. But it don&#x02BC;t signify 
                    <lb/>talking. Reader, beware of the <placeName corresp="#RHEINBERGHOTEL">Grosser Rheinberg hotel</placeName> at <placeName corresp="#COLOGNE">Cologne</placeName>. Art 
                    <lb/>thou a poet, a painter, or a romancer? Imagine the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>, the beautiful, 
                    <lb/>the mighty, the celebrated <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>, fouler than the <geogName corresp="#THAMES">Thames</geogName> at <placeName corresp="#LONDONBRDG">London
                    <lb/>Bridge</placeName>, compressed into almost as narrow a channel, washing dirty coal 
                    <lb/>wharfs on the one side; bogs, marshes, and coke manufactories on the 
                    <lb/>other, yellow with mud from beneath, black with tar and coal&#x2010;dust from 
                    <lb/>above, loaded with clumsy barges and dirty shipping; in short, a vile, sordid, 
                    <lb/>mercenary river, fit only for traffic, high Germans and low Dutchmen, 
                    <lb/>and you will have some idea of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>, as seen from the bedroom 
                    <lb/>windows of the Grosser Rheinberg.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="cologne_glosses_contextual.php#GROSSERRHEINBERGGLOSS"/> Oh, if thou wouldest see the Rhine as 
                    <lb/>it may be seen, as it ought to be seen, shut your eyes, sleep your time 
                    <lb/>away, do anything but look about you, till you get to <placeName corresp="#BONN">Bonn</placeName>, then walk<pb/>
                    <lb/>out upon the terrace which looks forth over the swell of the deep waters 
                    <lb/>to the dim outline of the <geogName corresp="#SIEBENGEBIRGE">seven mountains</geogName>,<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="cologne_glosses_contextual.php#SEVENMOUNTAINSGLOSS"/> and there gaze and dream and 
                    <lb/>meditate. Secondly, Art thou an epicure? Imagine mutton&#x2010;chops which 
                    <lb/>ought to have been tough, but which age had made tender, accompanied 
                    <lb/>by circular cakes of congealed fat, denominated gravy, together with a 
                    <lb/>kind of brown ashes, apparently moistened with whale oil (which, I think, 
                    <lb/>they called fried potatoes), as an addition to your feast, and you have an 
                    <lb/>idea of a dinner of the Grosser Rheinberg. I have omitted one thing, 
                    <lb/>however, which was really capital&#x2014;the vinegar. They called it Hock wine, 
                    <lb/>certainly, but that don&#x02BC;t signify; you must not be led astray by names in 
                    <lb/>this part of the world. However, good vinegar would not make up for 
                    <lb/>the want, or worse than want, of everything else; and although the waiters 
                    <lb/>made a point of not appearing until the bell had been rung seven times, 
                    <lb/>we at last made them understand that we neither liked their mode of 
                    <lb/>waiting, nor the contents of their larder, and so, according to their 
                    <lb/>deserts, deserted them.</p>
                <p>The <placeName corresp="#STPETERCATHEDRAL">cathedral</placeName> is the richest in fretwork and carving, in the delicate 
                    <lb/>finish of every shaft, and buttress, and pinnacle, that I saw on the journey, 
                    <lb/>except <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName>. They showed us, in a little Gothic chapel, three skulls, 
                    <lb/>which they told us were those of the Magi. They were set in framework 
                    <lb/>of gold, and covered with jewels, but the pomp became not the dry 
                    <lb/>bones. The soul&#x2010;less eye and fleshless cheek looked not the less horrible 
                    <lb/>though a diamond beamed through the one and a bar of gold bound the 
                    <lb/>other.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="cologne_glosses_contextual.php#MAGIGLOSS"/> Returned home, and the next morning departed from <placeName corresp="#COLOGNE">Cologne</placeName> 
                    <lb/>with regret, to trace the mighty <geogName corresp="RHINE">Rhine</geogName> to his source among the <geogName corresp="#RHAETIANALPS">Rhetian
                    <lb/>Alps</geogName>.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="cologne_glosses_contextual.php#RHAETIANALPSGLOSS"/></p>
