                    <p>Peter, my friend, you are going into the service of a noble Prince; as much as a mother can command her child, do I command you three things, which, if you do, rest assured they will enable you to pass through this present life with honour. The first is, that above all things you love and serve God, without offending Him in any way, if it be possible to you. For it is He who gave us life, it is He who will save us, and without Him and His grace we should not have the power to perform a single good work in this world. Recommend yourself to Him every morning and evening and He will give you aid. The second is, that you be mild and courteous to all Gentlemen, casting away pride. Be humble and obliging to everybody. Be not a slanderer or a liar. Keep yourself temperate in regard to eating &#x0026; drinking. Avoid envy it is a mean vice. Be neither a flatterer nor a tale-bearer, for people of this description do not usually attain to any high degree of excellence. Be loyal in word and deed. Keep your promises. Succour poor widows and orphans, and God will reward you. The third is, that you be bountiful of the goods that God shall give you to the poor and needy, for to give for His honours sake never made any man poor; and believe me, my child, the alms that you shall dispense will greatly profit both your body and soul.
