            <div type="witness" subtype="essay">
                <p>And this is our last excursion on <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Swiss</placeName> ground, thought I, scanning
                    <lb/>the provoking clouds that ever rolled massively among the regions of
                    <lb/>eternal snow, though far above the blue mountains that encircle their
                    <lb/>mighty monarch.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="chamouni_glosses_contextual.php#MCLIFFYDIADEMGLOSS"/> I have always a sort of kindred feeling for these
                    <lb/>beautiful blue hills; they ever look half <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">English</placeName>, and I love them for it.
                    <lb/>They may not be so wonderful, so majestic, so mighty, or so beautiful, but<pb/>
                    <lb/>they are more like home, sweet home, and it is pleasant, very pleasant, to
                    <lb/>meet a friend in a foreign land. We are going to <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</placeName>, <hi rend="italic">c&#x02BC;est vrai</hi>,
                    <lb/>but it seems exceeding strange. Before we left home, I had read of
                    <lb/><placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</placeName>, heard of <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</placeName>, and seen some few drawings of <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</placeName>,
                    <lb/>but never so much as dreamed of going to <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</placeName>, it seemed so un&#x2010;
                    <lb/>come&#x2010;at&#x2010;able; and for the <geogName corresp="#MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</geogName>, it seemed in another world, in fairy&#x2010;
                    <lb/>land, and of course had a magic halo thrown round it, an &#x00E6;therialness
                    <lb/>that can never be joined with reality. That halo comes again on looking
                    <lb/>back. And this is our last excursion on <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Swiss</placeName> ground, thought I, the
                    <lb/>last, and the wildest, and the sweetest, because&#x2014;because, perhaps it is
                    <lb/>the last. The day was exceedingly favourable for the scenery of the
                    <lb/>lower mountains, not for the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>; they were reserved for other times.
                    <lb/>The noon verged gradually from burning sunshine<ref type="gloss_textual" target="chamouni_prose_glosses_textual.php#SHINESHINEGLOSS" /> to thick thundery
                    <lb/>clouds, that rolled rapidly over the murky heaven as we entered a solitary
                    <lb/>mountain recess, a cliffy defile, leading from the valley of <placeName corresp="#MAGLAND">Maglan</placeName> to that
                    <lb/>of <placeName corresp="#SALLANCHES">Salenches</placeName>.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="chamouni_glosses_contextual.php#MAGLANTOSALLANCHESGLOSS"/> Down they burst with a fierce rattling turmoil and headlong
                    <lb/>flash, flash, flashing, and the bridleless clouds careered along the crags at
                    <lb/>such a wild rate that their own speed broke them into scattered confusion,
                    <lb/>that the blue sky shone calmly through their openings, and the labouring
                    <lb/>sun struggled strangely&#x2014;now gleaming waterily on the red&#x2010;ribbed skeleton
                    <lb/>crags, now mingling with the quiver of the lightning, now again plunged
                    <lb/>into the swift rack of the thunder&#x2010;clouds that seemed sweeping round the
                    <lb/>mountain summits like lashed ocean waves round a labouring vessel. The
                    <lb/><geogName corresp="#ARVE">Arve</geogName> swelled on the instant, and his turbid waves tore madly down, trees,
                    <lb/>stones, rocks, all tost along the channel, by the arrowy force of that
                    <lb/>resistless river, ever mighty, but now fearful. As the sun verged towards
                    <lb/>the horizon, the clouds swept partially away; the hills, the cliffs, the
                    <lb/>mountains, the rocks, and the blue vaulted sky glowed with his last rays
                    <lb/>for a moment; he sunk and the night came, his darkness made yet more
                    <lb/>visible by the thunder gloom of the storm.</p>

                <p>&#x201C;Voil&#x00E0; les aiguilles,&#x201D; quoth our char&#x2010;&#x00E0;&#x2010;banc driver. If any person in
                    <lb/>the whole world is totally insensible to pain, knocks, aches, and bruises, it
                    <lb/>must be a <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Swiss</placeName> char&#x2010;&#x00E0;&#x2010;banc driver. The <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Swiss</placeName> char&#x2010;&#x00E0;&#x2010;banc is a vehicle
                    <lb/>expressly built for the purpose of passing over those roads, which no
                    <lb/>other species of conveyance can pass over twelve yards of without immediate
                    <lb/>demolition. It is a sort of large side&#x2010;saddle, capable of containing, if
                    <lb/>well packed, three pauvres miserables, with a back and roof to it, and a
                    <lb/>board to put the feet on, with a leather to keep you in, all which are of
                    <lb/>a most ancient and venerable description; this is fixed totally without
                    <lb/>springs or anything of the kind, as far as I could see, upon four wheels,
                    <lb/>et voil&#x00E0; un char&#x2010;&#x00E0;&#x2010;banc. With this kind of vehicle, upon roads which
                    <lb/>always resemble and are often carried through the beds of tumbling
                    <lb/>mountain torrents, any one may easily imagine the sort of pleasurable
                    <lb/>penance to which he is subjected who submits to be driven from <placeName corresp="#SALLANCHES">Salenches</placeName>
                    <lb/>up to <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</placeName> in a char&#x2010;&#x00E0;&#x2010;banc.</p>

                <p>&#x201C;Voil&#x00E0; les aiguilles,&#x201D; quoth our char&#x2010;&#x00E0;&#x2010;banc driver.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="chamouni_glosses_contextual.php#VOILAGLOSS"/> How I started,
                    <lb/>I believe I was dreaming of home at the time; it is odd you always think<pb/>
                    <lb/>it would be very pleasant to be where you are not; it can&#x02BC;t be helped, but
                    <lb/>it is very provoking, the charms of a place always increase in geometrical
                    <lb/>ratio as you get farther from it, and therefore &#x02BC;tis a rich pleasure to look
                    <lb/>back on anything, though it has a dash of regret. It is singular that
                    <lb/>almost all pleasure is past, or coming. Well, I looked up, and lo! seven
                    <lb/>thousand feet above me soared the needles of <geogName corresp="#MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</geogName>, splintered and
                    <lb/>crashed and shivered, the marks of the tempest for three score centuries,
                    <lb/>yet they are here, shooting up red, bare, scarcely even lichened, entirely
                    <lb/>inaccessible, snowless, the very snow cannot cling to the down&#x2010;plunging
                    <lb/>sheerness of these terrific flanks that rise pre&#x2010;eminently dizzying and
                    <lb/>beetling above the sea of wreathed snow that rolled its long surging waves
                    <lb/>over the summits of the lower and less precipitous mountains. Then came
                    <lb/>the stretching gloominess of the pine forests, jagging darkly upon the
                    <lb/>ridge of every crag, strangely contrasted with the cold blueness of the
                    <lb/>peaky glaciers that filled the huge ravines between the hills, descending
                    <lb/>like the bursting billows of a chafed ocean tide from the desolate dominion
                    <lb/>of the snow, and curling forward till they lay on the green fields of
                    <lb/><placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</placeName>, which stretched away, one unbroken line of luxuriance, till
                    <lb/>bounded by the lonely desertness of the <placeName corresp="#COLDEBALME">Col de Balme</placeName>.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="chamouni_glosses_contextual.php#COLDEBALMEGLOSS"/> There is not
                    <lb/>another scene like <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</placeName> throughout all <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName>. In no other
                    <lb/>spot that I have seen is the rich luxuriance of the cultivated valley, the
                    <lb/>flashing splendour of the eternal snow, the impending magnificence of the
                    <lb/>bare, spiry crag, and the strange, cold rigidity of the surgy glaciers so
                    <lb/>dreadfully and beautifully combined, There is silence unbroken, no
                    <lb/>thunder of the avalanche comes crashing from the recesses of the hills,
                    <lb/>there is no voice from the chasmy glacier, no murmur from the thousand
                    <lb/>mountain streams, you are in solitude, a strange unearthly solitude, but
                    <lb/>you feel as if the air were full of spirits.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="chamouni_glosses_contextual.php#SPIRITSMONTBLANCGLOSS"/></p>
