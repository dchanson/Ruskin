                <p>When shall we get up this hill, this interminable hill?<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="cassel_glosses_contextual.php#CASSELLSHILLGLOSS"/> Bend after
                    <lb/>bend we have been ascending for the last half&#x2010;hour, every successive turn
                    <lb/>disclosing a weary length of way, and those tiresome windmills at the top 
                    <lb/>seem as far from us as ever. Windmills have long been celebrated for
                    <lb/>gesticulation, celebrated with <persName corresp="#MDC">Cervantes</persName> all over the world,<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="cassel_glosses_contextual.php#CERVANTESWINDMILLS"/> but never saw
                    <lb/>I windmills more provokingly alive than at present, with their long
                    <lb/>stretchy arms bending to the breeze that flew over the hilltop; they seemed
                    <lb/>beckoning us up ironically, while the slow measured step of our
                    <lb/>booted postillion, as he tramped it up the hill as much encumbered as a
                    <lb/>cat with walnut shells, told us of many a weary moment ere those becks
                    <lb/>should, could, or would be obeyed. We are on the summit, a green
                    <lb/>plateau of turf, that looks round on the wide plains of <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> without a
                    <lb/>single eminence to rival it, and few that can obstruct its view.&#x2014;Fifteen
                    <lb/>battle&#x2010;fields are in view from that spot, telling a fearful tale of the ready
                    <lb/>ire of nations, yet looking as green and peaceful as if they had never been
                    <lb/>watered with blood. They say the cliffs of <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName> are visible from
                    <lb/><placeName corresp="#CASSEL">Cassel</placeName>&#x2014;the 
                    sea certainly is, so I looked in the direction and I did see<pb/>
                    something. I had some lurking suspicions it was a cloud, but I chose
                    <lb/>to believe it was my own <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>, and it did quite as well to bid
                    <lb/>farewell to.</p>
                <p>I love a view like this, for it seems as if you were looking over all the
                    <lb/>wide, wide world and were ruling it. Throughout all our after journey I
                    <lb/>have seen nothing more beautiful or more wonderful of its kind than the
                    <lb/>view from the little, humble, neglected village of&#x2014;<placeName corresp="#CASSEL">Cassel</placeName>.</p>
