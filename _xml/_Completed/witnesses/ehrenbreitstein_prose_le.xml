                <div type="witness" subtype="prose">
                    <p>It is said that French will carry you over all <geogName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</geogName>, over all 
                        <lb/>civilised <geogName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</geogName> at least, and that may be, but it will not carry you 
                        <lb/>over <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName>. You might manage with the Grand Turk, but you will 
                        <lb/>not manage with the Germans. Wishing to see the interior of <placeName corresp="#EHRENBREITSTEIN">Ehren&#x2010;
                        <lb/>breitstein</placeName>, we got a young German guide, and crossing to a place where 
                        <lb/>two roads met, considered him to be going the wrong way. There was a 
                        <lb/>poser&#x2014;how could we stop him? &#x201C;Nein, nein,&#x201D; we called after him. &#x201C;Ya,&#x201D; 
                        <lb/>quoth he. &#x201C;Nein.&#x201D; So he went the way we chose.</p>
                    <p>After a very hard pull up an abominably cramp<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="ehrenbreitstein_glosses_contextual.php#EHRENBREITSTEINCRAMPGLOSS"/> hill, we beheld the 
                        <lb/>top of the flagstaff. Here we are all right. No. There was the 
                        <lb/>fortress certainly, but between us and it a ravine nearly a hundred feet 
                        <lb/>deep, walled up the sides so as to form a very unhandsome ditch, and two 
                        <lb/>or three dozen impudent, enormous, open&#x2010;mouthed guns grinning at us 
                        <lb/>from the battlement. Well, there was nothing for it, so we went back 
                        <lb/>and took the other path.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="ehrenbreitstein_glosses_contextual.php#EHRENBREITSTEINPATHGLOSS"/></p>
                    <p>This time all went right, and we got into the fortress, first, however, 
                        <lb/>prudently stepping up to a sentinel, to ask permission: and he brought 
                        <lb/>an officer upon us. &#x201C;Do you speak English, sir?&#x201D; (A stare.) &#x201C;Fran&#x00E7;ais?&#x201D; 
                        <lb/>(A vibratory motion of the head, and a &#x201C;Nein.&#x201D;) &#x201C;Deutsch?&#x201D; &#x201C;Ya,&#x201D; and 
                        <lb/>there we stuck. Well, we pulled out our passport, but it was in French, 
                        <lb/>and the officer could not read it. So he looked up and down and at us, 
                        <lb/>and we looked up and down and at him. What was to be done? We 
                        <lb/>bowed and he bowed, and we looked over the battlements and trotted 
                        <lb/>down again, having a very high opinion of the height of German hills, 
                        <lb/>the strength of German walls, the size of German cannon, and the stupidity 
                        <lb/>of all German brains.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="ehrenbreitstein_glosses_contextual.php#EHRENBREITSTEINGERMANBRAINS"/></p>
