                <p>Most beautiful are the paths which scale the face of the hill which is 
                    <lb/>crowned by the <name type="building" corresp="#HEIDELBERGCASTLE">castle of Heidelberg</name>,<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="heidelberg_glosses_contextual.php#BEAUTIFULPATHS"/> winding beneath the twisted branches 
                    <lb/>of green woods, with here and there a grey crag lifting up its lichened 
                    <lb/>head from the wilderness of brake<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="heidelberg_glosses_contextual.php#BRAKE"/> and grass and flower that concealed 
                    <lb/>the mass of that ancient <name type="geological" corresp="#GRANITE">granite</name>, sometimes supporting a fragment of the 
                    <lb/>remains of the old walls, with here and there an arrow&#x2010;slit choked up with 
                    <lb/>ivy, then emerging on narrow vallies or steep and rocky dells, or lovely 
                    <lb/>sweeps of dewy green sward, fresh and flowery as ever fairies circled on, 
                    <lb/>and ending on a lofty terrace whose precipice&#x2010;base was begirt with 
                    <lb/>meadow land, at the point where a narrow mountain gorge opened into 
                    <lb/>the mighty plains of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>, having in its embouchure<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="heidelberg_glosses_contextual.php#EMBOUCHURE"/> the little town 
                    <lb/>of <placeName corresp="#HEIDELBERG">Heidelberg</placeName>, with its river and its tall arched bridge, all glistening under 
                    <lb/>that most lovely of all lights,&#x2014;the first glow of sunshine, after a spring 
                    <lb/>shower.</p> 
                
                <p>The <placeName type="building" corresp="#HEIDELBERG">castle of Heidelberg</placeName> is exceeding desolate. Armies have razed 
                    <lb/>its foundations, the thunder hath riven its towers, and there is no sound 
                    <lb/>in its courts, and the wind is still in the open galleries.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="heidelberg_glosses_contextual.php#DESOLATE"/> The grass is very 
                    <lb/>green on the floor of the hall of the banquet, and the wild birds build 
                    <lb/>their nests in the watch&#x2010;towers, and they dwell in the dwellings of man, 
                    <lb/>for they are forsaken and left, and there is no voice there&#x2014;there is no 
                    <lb/>complaining in the dungeon, and where is the voice of gladness in the 
                    <lb/>hall? It is a ruin, a ruin, a desolate ruin. The husbandman sees it on 
                    <lb/>the height of the hills as he looks up from the green valley, and remembers 
                    <lb/>the power of his ancient princes, and knows not if he should grieve that 
                    <lb/>their power is past away. I know not how it is, but all nations in all 
                    <lb/>ages seem to have respected the juice of the fruit of the vine. All has 
                    <lb/>yielded to it from time immemorial. When Marshal Turenne attacked the 
                    <lb/>castle in question,<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="heidelberg_glosses_contextual.php#TURENNE"/> it was but a touch and go. The foundations were 
                    <lb/>blown up, the battlements were knocked down, the towers snapt like so 
                    <lb/>many sticks of barley sugar, the statues decapitated, the carving crashed, 
                    <lb/>the ditches filled, the castle ruined, but the cellars&#x2014; Walk into them, sir, 
                    <lb/>walk into them; there is not a rat dispossessed or in any manner disturbed.<pb/>
                    <lb/>Why, they seem to have stopped puffing off powder here as if they were 
                    <lb/>afraid of shaking up the lees of the good old respectable wines. Even 
                    <lb/>the timber of the new&#x2010;fangled fashionable cask (which, following the 
                    <lb/>example of the ladies nowadays, has gone without hoops) are not a whit 
                    <lb/>disturbed, but sit there in peaceful placidity, clasping each other in 
                    <lb/>brotherly affection, but dry, very dry, unconscionably dry. And the cele&#x2010;
                    <lb/>brated butt sounds mournfully hollow&#x2014;<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="heidelberg_glosses_contextual.php#CELEBRATEDBUTT"/> no rich splash from the enclosed 
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">vinum</hi>,<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="heidelberg_glosses_contextual.php#VINUM"/> no ruby red tinging the joints of the timbers. Oh, <name type="fictional" corresp="#BACCHUS">Bacchus</name>! 
                    <lb/><name type="fictional" corresp="#BACCHUS">Bacchus</name>! come not into the cellars of <placeName type="building" corresp="#HEIDELBERG">Heidelberg</placeName>, lest thou shouldest die 
                    <lb/>of thirst.</p>
