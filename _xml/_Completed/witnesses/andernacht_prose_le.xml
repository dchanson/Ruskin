                <p>What is it that makes the very heart leap within you at the sight of a 
                    <lb/>hill&#x02BC;s blue outline; that so &#x00E6;therializes the soul and ennobles the spirit; 
                    <lb/>that so raises you from the earth and from aught of the earth? Is it 
                    <lb/>their apparent proximity to the blue heaven&#x02BC;s inaccessibleness? is it the 
                    <lb/>humbling sense of your own littleness or the immoveable, unchangeable 
                    <lb/>magnificence of that which has seen the beginning of the world and will see<pb/>
                    <lb/>its end, or is it that the thoughts range insensibly from the things created 
                    <lb/>to Him who created them? I know not. How it thrilled through me, 
                    <lb/>when first, far away, across the lake&#x2010;like swell of the deep waters of that 
                    <lb/>wondrous river, rose the cloudy outline of the blue mountains. Long time 
                    <lb/>hath past over me since I saw the swell of a blue hill. I have longed for 
                    <lb/>them&#x2014;I have yearned for them as an exile yearns for his native land, and 
                    <lb/>I am with them.</p>
                <p>We left <placeName corresp="#COLOGNE">Cologne</placeName> on a misty summer morning, its many turreted spires 
                    <lb/>rising colossally, but grey and faint amid the wreathing columns of mist, 
                    <lb/>which smoked upward from the course of the broad <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>. There was 
                    <lb/>the huge cathedral, dark with the confused richness of its own fretwork, 
                    <lb/>and the remains of its unfinished but magnificent tower showing ruin&#x2010;like 
                    <lb/>beside it.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="andernacht_glosses_contextual.php#ANDERNACHTCATHEDRALTOWERGLOSS"/> There were the red sails and mingled masts of the innumerable 
                    <lb/>shipping, without one sail swelling or a flag bending with the morning 
                    <lb/>breeze. There was that peaceful and lovely lassitude over everything, that 
                    <lb/>sleep of the earth, and the air, and the sky, that charms the mind into a 
                    <lb/>correspondent fascination of stillness, the very thoughts seem sleeping.</p>
                <p>We went on, we past <placeName corresp="#BONN">Bonn</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#GODESBERG">Godesberg</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#DRACHENFELS">Drachenfels</placeName>,<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="andernacht_glosses_contextual.php#ANDERNACHTWEWENTONGLOSS"/> and 
                    <lb/>sunset was sorrowing over hill and valley when the gloomy and venerable 
                    <lb/>towers of <placeName corresp="#ANDERNACH">Andernacht</placeName> beetled over us.</p>
                <p>I love to look upon the crags that <persName corresp="#JULIUSCAESAR">C&#x00E6;sar</persName> has scaled, and upon the 
                    <lb/>towers that his legions have founded. These are now as they were then, 
                    <lb/>looking up to the broad blue heaven, these are in ruins.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="andernacht_glosses_contextual.php#ANDERNACHTTHESEGLOSS"/> Yet they 
                    <lb/>are mighty in their ruin, and majestic in their decay, but their Lords are 
                    <lb/>departed and forgotten as the waves that once lashed their foundations. 
                    <lb/>Other snows have melted, and the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> yet rolls onward unbroken, but 
                    <lb/>those waves are lost in the ocean for ever.</p>
