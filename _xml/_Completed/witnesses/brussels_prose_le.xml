                <p><placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> is a lovely, a queen&#x2010;like city&#x2014;from a distance, sweeping up 
                    <lb/>the flanks of its hill, battlement over battlement swelling up higher, and 
                    <lb/>higher, and (yet) higher, and the massive obscurity of the two huge square 
                    <lb/>cathedral tow&#x02BC;rs looming over the whole, and contrasted strangely with 
                    <lb/>the delicate sharp spiriness of the steeple of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELS">H&#x00F4;tel de ville</placeName>.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="brussels_glosses_contextual.php#CATHEDRALHOTELDEVILLEGLOSS"/> <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName> 
                    <lb/>would look like an assemblage of brick&#x2010;kilns beside it.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="brussels_glosses_contextual.php#PARISBRICKKILNSGLOSS"/> We saw <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> 
                    <lb/>at eleven miles&#x02BC; distance, its towers rising dark and spear&#x2010;like out of the 
                    <lb/>horizon. It was waxing dark as we entered the city, and the lights began 
                    <lb/>to twinkle in the few, the very few shop windows. I love to pass through 
                    <lb/>a city at night, the hum of the voices rises so softly out of the obscurity, 
                    <lb/>and the figures flit about dark and bat&#x2010;like, and the cold starlight mingles 
                    <lb/>so strangely with the red swarthy gleam of the lamps; and when you look 
                    <lb/>up, the narrow strip of sky is of such a dark, dark blue, you may see it 
                    <lb/>appear to quiver with the starlight if you look long, and the white house&#x2010;
                    <lb/>fronts rise so ghastly, so ghost&#x2010;like against it, and the windows seem 
                    <lb/>grinning maliciously askance at you. It makes one shiver to think of it.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="brussels_glosses_contextual.php#WAXINGDARKGLOSS"/> 
                    <lb/>Cities are exceedingly picturesque when built upon hills; but for exploring, 
                    <lb/>for circumnavigating, for perambulating&#x2014;Oh, woe to the walker who is 
                    <lb/>compelled to drag himself up their steeps, those tiresome paved steeps,
                    <pb/>
                    those hard, unyielding, provokingly smooth flagstones, or to go thundering 
                    <lb/>down, his rapidity increasing every instant, when he is once in for it 
                    <lb/>lurching tremendously like a ship in a swell, jerk, jerk, jerking&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Oh, facilis

                    <lb/>of <placeName corresp="#GIBRALTAR">Gibraltar</placeName> as storm the heights of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#HOTELDEBELLEVUE">H&#x00F4;tel de Bellevue</placeName>; whence, for all 
                    <lb/>the boast of its title, I never could discover more <hi rend="italic">belle vue</hi> than a dusty 
                    <lb/>square, some formal houses, and a few murky park trees.</p>
                <p>We left <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> on Wednesday morning<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="brussels_glosses_contextual.php#WEDNESDAYMORNING"/> for <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName>; the sun beamed 
                    <lb/>sweetly among the long trunks of the aged trees of the forest of <placeName corresp="#SONIANFOREST">Soigny</placeName>;<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="brussels_glosses_contextual.php#FORESTOFSOIGNYGLOSS"/> 
                    <lb/>and their damp bark glistened dewily,&#x2014;as it rose up taller and taller, 
                    <lb/>branching off into the bending boughs, and slender spray, with the delicate 
                    <lb/>foliage scattered through: here every leaf defined separately and clearly 
                    <lb/>as you looked up to the broad sky; there in light, spready masses, par&#x2010;
                    <lb/>tially concealing the long tapery trunks which retired back, farther and 
                    <lb/>still farther, yet distinctly grouped, and those groups separated by the 
                    <lb/>gleamy stream of yellow sunshine, which shone full on the sides of the 
                    <lb/>swelling green grassy banks, then broken by the intervening hollows, 
                    <lb/>then climbing again up the dewy moss and white trunks. It was exceed&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ing beautiful; I could have fancied the glister<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="brussels_glosses_contextual.php#GLISTERGLOSS"/> of the bright bayonets 
                    <lb/>changing, like starlight on a wavy ocean, among the retiring foliage of 
                    <lb/>those ancient trees&#x2014;I forgot how many long years had past by since 
                    <lb/>that eventful day.</p>
                <p>This is the field of <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName>.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="brussels_glosses_contextual.php#FIELDOFWATERLOOGLOSS"/> The round hills of green pasture lay 
                    <lb/>unbroken before me, without a single tree, except where, fax to the right, 
                    <lb/>the rich forest country commenced again, breaking away in rounded 
                    <lb/>masses, till lost in the blue of the faint horizon. All is peace now. 
                    <lb/>Englishmen may feel proud on the field of <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName>&#x2014;perhaps I did; but
