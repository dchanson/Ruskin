                <p><placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> is a lovely, a queen&#x2010;like city&#x2014;from a distance, sweeping up<lb/>
                    the flanks of its hill, battlement over battlement swelling up higher, and<lb/>
                    higher, and (yet) higher, and the massive obscurity of the two huge square<lb/>
                    cathedral tow&#x02BC;rs looming over the whole, and contrasted strangely with<lb/>
                    the delicate sharp spiriness of the steeple of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELS">H&#x00F4;tel de ville</placeName>.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="brussels_glosses_contextual.php#CATHEDRALHOTELDEVILLEGLOSS"/> <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName><lb/>
                    would look like an assemblage of brick&#x2010;kilns beside it.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="brussels_glosses_contextual.php#PARISBRICKKILNSGLOSS"/> We saw <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName><lb/>
                    at eleven miles&#x02BC; distance, its towers rising dark and spear&#x2010;like out of the<lb/>
                    horizon. It was waxing dark as we entered the city, and the lights began<lb/>
                    to twinkle in the few, the very few shop windows. I love to pass through<lb/>
                    a city at night, the hum of the voices rises so softly out of the obscurity,<lb/>
                    and the figures flit about dark and bat&#x2010;like, and the cold starlight mingles<lb/>
                    so strangely with the red swarthy gleam of the lamps; and when you look<lb/>
                    up, the narrow strip of sky is of such a dark, dark blue, you may see it<lb/>
                    appear to quiver with the starlight if you look long, and the white house&#x2010;<lb/>
                    fronts rise so ghastly, so ghost&#x2010;like against it, and the windows seem<lb/>
                    grinning maliciously askance at you. It makes one shiver to think of it.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="brussels_glosses_contextual.php#WAXINGDARKGLOSS"/><lb/>
                    Cities are exceedingly picturesque when built upon hills; but for exploring,<lb/>
                    for circumnavigating, for perambulating&#x2014;Oh, woe to the walker who is<lb/>
                    compelled to drag himself up their steeps, those tiresome paved steeps,
                <pb/>
                    those hard, unyielding, provokingly smooth flagstones, or to go thundering<lb/>
                    down, his rapidity increasing every instant, when he is once in for it<lb/>
                    lurching tremendously like a ship in a swell, jerk, jerk, jerking&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Oh, facilis<lb/>

                <p>We left <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> on Wednesday morning<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="brussels_glosses_contextual.php#WEDNESDAYMORNING"/> for <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName>; the sun beamed<lb/>
                    sweetly among the long trunks of the aged trees of the forest of <geogName corresp="#SONIANFOREST">Soigny</geogName>;<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="brussels_glosses_contextual.php#FORESTOFSOIGNYGLOSS"/><lb/>
                    and their damp bark glistened dewily,&#x2014;as it rose up taller and taller,<lb/>
                    branching off into the bending boughs, and slender spray, with the delicate<lb/>
                    foliage scattered through: here every leaf defined separately and clearly<lb/>
                    as you looked up to the broad sky; there in light, spready masses, par&#x2010;<lb/>
                    tially concealing the long tapery trunks which retired back, farther and<lb/>
                    still farther, yet distinctly grouped, and those groups separated by the<lb/>
                    gleamy stream of yellow sunshine, which shone full on the sides of the<lb/>
                    swelling green grassy banks, then broken by the intervening hollows,<lb/>
                    then climbing again up the dewy moss and white trunks. It was exceed&#x2010;<lb/>
                    ing beautiful; I could have fancied the glister<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="brussels_glosses_contextual.php#GLISTERGLOSS"/> of the bright bayonets<lb/>
                    changing, like starlight on a wavy ocean, among the retiring foliage of<lb/>
                    those ancient trees&#x2014;I forgot how many long years had past by since<lb/>
                    that eventful day.</p>

                    the rich forest country commenced again, breaking away in rounded<lb/>
                    masses, till lost in the blue of the faint horizon. All is peace now.<lb/>
                    Englishmen may feel proud on the field of <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName>&#x2014;perhaps I did; but<lb/>
