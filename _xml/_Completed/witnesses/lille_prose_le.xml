                <p><hi rend="italic">Passeport, monsieur, s&#x02BC;il vous plait</hi>. I hate fortified towns, in general, 
                    <lb/>that is.&#x2014;Their houses are like barracks, their public buildings like prisons, 
                    <lb/>their population like so many rats in a rat trap; they are arduous to get 
                    <lb/>in,<ref type="gloss_textual" target="lille_prose_glosses_textual.php#GETIN" /> difficult to get out, and disagreeable to remain in. To all this, how&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ever, <placeName corresp="#LILLE">Lille</placeName> is an exception, except in one circumstance&#x2014;its difficulty of access. 
                    <lb/>We were detained after a long day&#x02BC;s journey under a burning sun, hot, 
                    <lb/>hungry, and stupid, while our passport was examined. Slowly the sentinel 
                    <lb/>unfolded the paper, spelled over its contents with tiresome coolness and 
                    <lb/>provoking minuteness, slowly returned it, and then came&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Passez</hi>.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="lille_glosses_contextual.php#PASSPORT"/> And 
                    <lb/>pass we did right gladly. <placeName corresp="#LILLE">Lille</placeName> is a beautiful, a most beautiful town. I 
                    <lb/>have seen none equal to it, for grandeur of effect, for the massive magni&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ficence of its edifices, for the palace like nobility of its streets, except 
                    <lb/><placeName corresp="#GENOA">Genoa</placeName>. The day also on which we entered it was almost Italian, the sky 
                    <lb/>was of such a deep and unbroken blue, and a stream of rich, glowing, 
                    <lb/>tawny light shot upon the full fretwork and elaborate carving of the upper 
                    <lb/>parts of the houses; but their bases, owing to the narrowness of the 
                    <lb/>streets and the enormous height of the opposing buildings, were wrapt in 
                    <lb/>shade, deep, gloomily deep, when contrasted with the flood of sunshine 
                    <lb/>that glanced on the gable roofs, and almost gave to life<ref type="gloss_textual" target="lille_prose_glosses_textual.php#GAVETOLIFE" /> the many statues 
                    <lb/>of the <persName corresp="#VIRGINMARY">Virgin</persName>, that stood beneath their Gothic niches, really very respect&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ably sculptured, at every angle of the streets.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="lille_glosses_contextual.php#SHADE"/></p>
