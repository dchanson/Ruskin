                <p>W<hi rend="smallcaps">hat</hi> a delicious thing is a reverie, that total abstraction from all 
                    <lb/>things present&#x2014;that stilly, dreamy, waking vision that places you where 
                    <lb/>you are not, that carries you where you wish to be, that presents the past 
                    <lb/>to your recollection, and the future to your fancy, so forcibly, so impressively, 
                    <lb/>so lovelily, throwing a glow on every circumstance, and a halo on every 
                    <lb/>feature, giving the vivid, the magic colouring of the dream to the defined 
                    <lb/>and distinct recollection of the reality. It is thus that I look back upon 
                    <lb/>our first walk at <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</placeName>, to the Source of the <geogName corresp="#ARVERON">Arveron</geogName>.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="source_of_the_arveron_prose_glosses_contextual.php#WALKTOTHESOURCE"/> What varieties 
                    <lb/>of childish beauty we met with in that short walk, every little mountaineer 
                    <lb/>was a perfect picture; one little fellow insisted upon conducting us to the 
                    <lb/>source, and as <hi rend="italic">notre guide principale</hi> piloted us proudly through the crowd 
                    <lb/>of little fry who were lying in wait, all expecting a similar distinction, 
                    <lb/>but who, finding the post of honour preoccupied, followed very gravely <hi rend="italic">en
                    <lb/>suite</hi>.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="source_of_the_arveron_prose_glosses_contextual.php#VARIETIESOFCHILDISHBEAUTY"/> 
                    &#x201C;Voil&#x00E0; la source,&#x201D; quoth our <hi rend="italic">petit conducteur</hi>, as we emerged from a 
                    <lb/>dark wood of pines bordering on the waves of the flowing <geogName corresp="#ARVERON">Arveron</geogName>. It was 
                    <lb/>exceeding lovely. The day had been one continued succession of storms, 
                    <lb/>but the eve was breaking and giving fair promise of a sunny morrow. 
                    <lb/>Right in front a few exhausted but lingering tempest clouds shadowed 
                    <lb/>the dark masses of pine that girdle the <geogName corresp="#MONTANVERT">Montanvert</geogName>,<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="source_of_the_arveron_prose_glosses_contextual.php#MONTANVERT"/> but farther to 
                    <lb/>the west broke away into fleecy masses, scarcely distinguishable from the 
                    <lb/>eternal snow that flashed through their openings, and farther still a serene 
                    <lb/>evening sky glowed peacefully. A lurid, ominous light pervaded the 
                    <lb/>whole air, that stormy and murky lume, the effect of the strange combat 
                    <lb/>between the sun and tempest; the one casting the whole body of gigantic<pb/>
                    <lb/>mountains into a dreary darkness, the other pouring a stream of red, 
                    <lb/>ghostly, dusky light up the valley, that caught as it past the projecting 
                    <lb/> pinnacled spires of the <geogName corresp="#BOSSONS">glacier des Bossons</geogName>, which flashed dazzling forth 
                    <lb/>from the gloom of the ribbed crags as the lightning leaps from the 
                    <lb/>thunder cloud. A low, hollow, melancholy echoing was heard issuing from 
                    <lb/>the recesses of the mountains, the last sighing of the passing&#x2010;away tempest, 
                    <lb/>the last murmurs of the storm spirit as he yielded up his reign; it past 
                    <lb/>away, and the blue rigidness of the transparent cavern of the glacier woke 
                    <lb/>rosily to the departing sun.</p>
