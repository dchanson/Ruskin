                    <p>In <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref>, the poem is identified only as &#x201C;poem I&#x201D;, the first poem in the 
                        <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">MS I Poetry Anthology</title></ref>. Other poems in the 
                        anthology carry a substantive title along with the numbered designation &#x201C;poem II&#x201D;, &#x201C;poem III&#x201D;, and so 
                        on.</p>
                    <p>Between the heading &#x201C;poem I&#x201D; and the text of the poem, however, there is visible the letter <hi rend="italic">o</hi>, followed by an erased 
                        line that is centered on the page like a title&#x2014;&#x201C;The hunt by dar&#x201D; or the last three letters may be 
                        &#x201C;day&#x201D;. If the last three letters are <hi rend="italic">dar</hi>, they probably refer to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s source, a 
                        poem by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="darwin_erasmus_note.php"><persName corresp="#ED">Erasmus Darwin</persName></ref> 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</ref>). The erased title, if that is what it is, perhaps belonged to the 
                        draft: other partial erasures beneath the text reveal apparently that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> copied a draft or semi&#x2010;final version here, in 
                        <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref>, 
                        and then erased the draft as he printed the fair copy over top (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</ref>).</p>
                    <p>The title &#x201C;The Steam Engine&#x201D; was invented by 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="collingwood_w_g_note.php"><persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName></ref> for

                        <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> perhaps based his title on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s commentary on the poem

                        override the most straightforward interpretation of <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s having assigned 
                        the date of <date when="1826-01">January 1826</date> specifically to <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php#DATE"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHENEEDLESSALARM">&#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;</title></ref> 
                        and thereby singling out that work, possibly, as Ruskin&#x02BC;s earliest surviving poem.</p>
                    <p>On internal evidence, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESTEAMENGINE">&#x201C;When furious up from mines the water pours&#x201D; [&#x201C;The Steam Engine&#x201D;]</title> 
                        is more logically placed in <date notBefore="1826-09" notAfter="1826-12">late 1826</date> or 
                        <date notBefore="1827-01" notAfter="1827-04">early 1827</date>, since during that period, according to another annotation by his <persName corresp="#MR">mother</persName>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> completed the entirety of this <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Book</ref> (see

                        the content of the poem is consistent with the kinds of sources pervading the concluding chapters of 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I&#x201D;</title></ref>, which
                        precedes the anthology. Both the prose lesson and the poem reflect the preoccupations of Enlightenment educationists, 
                        and it is logical that, compositionally, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> maintained the theme of scientific and industrial optimism as he completed the prose lesson 
                        and started the poetry anthology.</p>

                                    <p>The knife came first to his recollection;

                                        I read an account of them while we were at <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MRFRANKLANDME">Mr. Frankland</persName>&#x02BC;s, in one of the notes to that <title type="poem" corresp="#DARWINBOTANICGARDEN">Botanic Garden</title>,

It said, that there is a magnificent apparatus for coining, 
                                        all worked by one steam engine, which cuts halfpence out of sheets of copper, and at one stroke stamps both the faces and edge of the money&#x201D;.</p>

                                        worked by that great giant enchanter, the steam engine, make&#x2014;how many guineas do you think, in one hour? thirty thousand, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MAMMAME">mamma</persName>.

                                        but that a far more magnificent apparatus for coining

                                        and fixed in their minds, by what they had already seen. He was glad to find that they had taken pleasure in following the history of the progress and consequences of those noble discoveries; 
                                        he would therefore take care not to confuse their minds, by showing them the details of small ingenious contrivances,

                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> must have consulted the full passage on coining in <title type="poem" corresp="#DARWINBOTANICGARDEN"><hi rend="italic">The Botanic Garden</hi></title>, 
                                however, since his poem engages with numerous details of diction in <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, 
                                which he could not have derived from either <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s or <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s selections alone.</p>
                            <p>In his adaptation, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> somewhat reorders the sequence of topics in the original, 
                                using less figurative language but also elaborating <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s pictures 
                                in his own way (for details, see the glosses to the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title> witness). 
                                Like <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> begins with the engine draining water from mines to expose the ore. 
                                Next, appearing to have misunderstood <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                                figurative account of a bellows that imprisons &#x201C;gales&#x201D; of forceful wind, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> substitutes a literal storm in lines 2&#x2013;3 of his poem, 
                                but in fact he has separated the figurative from its object, recurring to the bellows later in his list of useful applications of steam. 
                                Meanwhile, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intervenes in <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s sequence with steamboats, 
                                which rescue the victims of exploding steamboats&#x2014;an ironic anecdote that seems to bemuse <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, 
                                and that effectively deflates the optimism of <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s futuristic peroration, which predicts the wonders of steam transport. 
                                Three decades on, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> seems to know better than <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName> whose aeronauts beckon from fanciful flying chariots. 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> corrects <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s anticipation of a time when steam shall &#x201C;drag the slow barge&#x201D;, 
                                remarking that the &#x201C;smokey barge [is] called by us steam boat&#x201D;.</p>
                            <p>Nonetheless, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> admits that steam is &#x201C;the most useful engine brought to man&#x201D;, 
                                and he returns to <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s list of wonders, if only to scramble its order again. 
                                Saving for later <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s pumps that fill cisterns and pipe water to &#x201C;thirsty cities&#x201D;, 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> presses on to <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s steam&#x2010;powered millstones, 
                                which enchant him for <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s rhyme of <hi rend="italic">whirl</hi> and <hi rend="italic">twirl</hi> 
                                (thrice repeated by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>). He has no use 
                                for <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s pitch for grain&#x2010;based vegetarianism, preferring to keep up the &#x201C;twirling&#x201D; 
                                by introducing instead <persName corresp="#SRA">Arkwright</persName>&#x02BC;s cotton spinning machine. 
                                The action of revolving seems to take over <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, as he continues with <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName> 
                                to describe the round coins minted by <persName corresp="#MB">Boulton</persName>&#x02BC;s machine 
                                (here he is taken by another of <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s rhymes, <hi rend="italic">squeeze</hi> and <hi rend="italic">seize</hi>); 
                                and he comes back to <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s water pumped to thirsty cities in order to 
                                send the water &#x201C;round the town&#x201D; and back again. Finally, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> clenches these revolutions 
                                with an original contribution&#x2014;the picture of a chain that an engine has forged &#x201C;link to link&#x201D; and impressed with a floral design like a bracelet.</p>
                            <p>Formally, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> borrows <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s heroic couplets without the pomposity of what 
                                <persName corresp="#WW">Wordsworth</persName> condemns in the preface to <title type="book" corresp="#WORDSWORTHLYRICALBALLADS"><hi rend="italic">Lyrical Ballads</hi></title> 
                                as the artifice of poetic diction. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> catches <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s livelier rhyme words, 
                                and the poet&#x02BC;s energy and exuberance. Of course, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may simply have avoided a learnedness of diction that he did not understand 
                                at his young age; he shows a similar preference for poetic over pedantic terms in his
                                adaptation of <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></ref>,

                                liked unusual words that could energize his writing; and perhaps the appeal for him of <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s poetry lay 
                                in the extraordinary fertility with which the poet invented words&#x2014;a major factor in the success of 
                                <title type="poem" corresp="#DARWINBOTANICGARDEN"><hi rend="italic">The Botanic Garden</hi></title>, as suggested by <persName corresp="#DGK">D. G. King&#x2010;Hele</persName>

                            <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may even have appreciated <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName> for a quality that, in the poet&#x02BC;s own time, was a target 
                                for criticism&#x2014;his tendency to make &#x201C;every word picturesque&#x201D;, as <persName corresp="#RS">Robert Southey</persName> characterized his diction, 
                                or &#x201C;a succession of Landscapes or Paintings&#x201D;, as <persName corresp="#STC">S. T. Coleridge</persName> viewed the poems, 
                                to the extent that temporal connection and development seemed to suffer. <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s friend in the town where he practiced medicine, 
                                the poet <persName corresp="ASPOET">Anna Seward</persName>, the &#x201C;Swan of Lichfield&#x201D;, agreed with this appraisal, 
                                but she perceived a virtue in <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s sacrifice of &#x201C;intersticial space&#x201D; between his images, 
                                and in his spatial rather than temporal, imagination (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PRIESTMANPOETRYOFDARWIN"><persName corresp="#MPRIESTMAN">Priestman</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#PRIESTMANPOETRYOFDARWIN"><hi rend="italic">Poetry of Erasmus Darwin</hi></title></ref>, 34). 
                                <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName> may have helped form the taste on which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                                would later base his critique of the pathetic fallacy.</p>

                            <p>The Ruskins might have been interested, too, that <persName corresp="#MB">Boulton</persName>&#x02BC;s coin press, its workings placed at the climax of

                                As critics have argued, however, the conditions of the laborers who operated such machinery are ignored in <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s poetry, 
                                in which he causes the machines either to be driven by a dainty mythological crew or to seem to run themselves owing to intransitive verbs that allow for no other agency

                                The operation of <persName corresp="#MB">Boulton</persName>&#x02BC;s coin press is an exception to this obfuscation, in that the four boys are acknowledged in one of <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s
