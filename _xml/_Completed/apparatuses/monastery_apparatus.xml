                        but more likely in <date when="1828">1828</date>; 
                        &#x201c;Book III&#x201d; and &#x201c;Book IV&#x201d; may have been composed and fair&#x2010;copied (not completed) by <date when="1829-03">March 1829</date>.</p>
                    
                    <p><persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> dated the work from the <date notBefore="1828-01" notAfter="1828-06">&#x201C;early part of 1828&#x201D; or &#x201C;first half of 1828&#x201D;</date>, 
                        based on his analysis of the sequence in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> entered poetry selections in <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref> (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>; and see

                        <persName corresp="#ETC">E. T. Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName> disagreed 
                        and ascribed the work to <date when="1827">1827</date>, in the belief that the poem was &#x201c;a result of [<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s] visit 
                        to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> in that year&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref> 2:260 n. 1; and see 276 n. 1). 
                        <persName corresp="#HGV">Helen Viljoen</persName> was initially inclined to accept the earlier date, because she considered the hand in the 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">IA</title></ref> draft to be &#x201c;very childish&#x201d;, but then she decided that 
                        <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> had &#x201c;no legitimate basis&#x201d; 
                        for correcting <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02bc;s date of <date when="1828">1828</date> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#VILJOENPAPERS">&#x201C;Helen Gill Viljoen Papers&#x201D;</ref>, box F, transcription of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>).</p>
                    
                    <p>The reasoning by the editors of the Library Edition seems to stand on the most speculative evidence&#x2014;namely, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s comment in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> 
                        that he &#x201c;used to read the <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTABBOT"><hi rend="italic">Abbot</hi></title> at <placeName corresp="#KINROSS">Kinross</placeName>, 
                        and the <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY"><hi rend="italic">Monastery</hi></title> in <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glen Farg</geogName>&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 2:260 n. 1; 35:16). 
                        While <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may well have associated <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s novels with landmarks along the Ruskins&#x02bc; route to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> in the <date notBefore="1820-01-01" notAfter="1829-12-31">1820s</date>, 
                        the editors neglect to explain why these associations should be tied so specifically to the journey of <date when="1827">1827</date>. It is not known when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first read <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY"><hi rend="italic">Monastery</hi></title> 
                        or heard it read to him. The case is strengthened, however, by the contents of <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref>, 
                        the manuscript containing the fair copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>. Immediately preceding 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s poem occurs the anthology, <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        which includes poems describing <placeName type="building" corresp="#LOCHLEVENCAS">Loch Leven Castle</placeName> and <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glen Farg</geogName>&#x2014;the 
                        points along the journey to <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> that, according to <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> connected with his reading of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s novels. (In fact, it may have been this evidence in 
                        <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> that originally prompted <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s comment in the autobiography, 
                        rather than this evidence independently documenting his memory.) In using this statement in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> 
                        to link <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> to the family journey to <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> in <date when="1827">1827</date>, 
                        the editors of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> evidently did not base their conclusion on the juxtaposition of the poem with 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        since they believed the latter to date from <date when="1826">1826</date> 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 2:260 n. 1, and see 535). 
                        But the poems in <title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title> do in fact belong to the family tour of <date when="1827">1827</date>, tending to confirm <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02bc;s speculations. 
                        <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName>&#x02bc;s qualms about a date this early can be resolved by evidence that this tour fell unusually late in <date when="1827">1827</date>&#x2014;primarily 
                        in <date notBefore="1827-08" notAfter="1827-11">September and October, with departure sometime in August, and return sometime in November</date> 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tours_of_1826-27_note.php">Tours of <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1827">1826&#x2013;27</date></ref>).</p>
                        
                    <p>The evidence is more indirect regarding whether <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>&#x2014;or at least its first one or two books&#x2014;should be considered a contemporaneous 
                        with the <date when="1827">1827</date> <title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title> project, 
                        or, as <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> contends, an insertion in that place from a later time. As explained in 
                        <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>, the only documented record of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s labor 
                        on <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> dates from <date when="1829-03">March 1829</date>, 
                        and even that passing reference in a letter is somewhat ambiguous. The statement might mean that, at that time, he was returning to composition and/or fair copy of the poem itself, 
                        or that he was working on something in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, which he meant to simply identify by its contents&#x2014;that is, 
                        the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Book</ref> known in the family for its containing 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>. Based on the concatenation of evidence 
                        in <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>, it appears likely that, in <date when="1829-03">March 1829</date>, 
                        he did compose and/or fair&#x2010;copy some portion of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>&#x2014;probably, 
                        books 3&#x2013;4 (which he left incomplete)&#x2014;while books 1&#x2013;2 date from an earlier period. This period may be as early as 
                        <date notBefore="1827-09" notAfter="1827-12">between September and December 1827</date>, but more likely from some time in <date when="1828">1828</date>. 
                        The poem&#x02bc;s associations with travel to Scotland may not derive from the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tours_of_1826-27_note.php"><date when="1827">Tour of 1827</date></ref>, 
                        but from the sadder occasion of mourning the loss of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_jessie_note.php"></ref><persName corresp="#JRP">Aunt Jessie</persName>,

                        began his &#x201C;novel&#x201D; at this time; however, in his <ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1829-03-10_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_jjr_1829-03-10"><date when="1829-03-10">10 March 1829</date> letter</title></ref> to his father, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> implies that <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> was already familiar with some portion of the versified novel. 
                        Initial composition may therefore have significantly predated <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201c;finishing&#x201d; of <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref>.

                        There is no physical break between the anthology and the &#x201c;novel&#x201d; to indicate a change in genre or project, 
                        so it is possible that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> considered <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> to be a continuation of the <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                        Given the inclusion in <title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title> of travel poems

                        and the juxtaposition of these poems with the verse novel, this portion of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> 
                        bears witness to (and may even have inspired) <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s autobiographical recollection that he 
                        &#x201c;used to read the <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTABBOT"><hi rend="italic">Abbot</hi></title> at <placeName corresp="#KINROSS">Kinross</placeName>,

                        He &#x201C;thought&#x201d;, he goes on, &#x201C;that the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WHITELADY">White Lady</persName> had as certainly lived by the streamlet [the <geogName corresp="#FARG">Farg</geogName>] in that glen of the <geogName corresp="#OCHILS">Ochils</geogName>,

                        As further evidence shows, however, while <title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title> establishes a lower limit 
                        in the time of composition for <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>, the two projects were distinct.</p>

                        for composition of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>, how much time separated the verse novel from the tour poem anthology? For this question, the only evidence is handwriting. 
                        The hand for the verse novel uses print lettering similar to that for <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref>, but generally smaller. 
                        Size of lettering in fact varies considerably within the anthology itself, the smallest being used for its first poem, 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="ragland_castle_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRRAGLANDCASTLE">&#x201c;Ragland Castle&#x201d;</title></ref>. Still, regardless of size, and despite the similarity in formation of letters, 
                        there is greater affinity between the lettering throughout the poems in <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref> 
                        and the lettering used for the original versions of two of its poems, <ref type="apparatus" target="wales_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRWALES">&#x201c;Wales&#x201d;</title></ref> and 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="spring_blank_verse_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRSPRINGBLANKVERSE">&#x201c;Spring: Blank Verse&#x201d;</title></ref> 
                        (as first fair&#x2010;copied in a <ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1827-05_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_jjr_1827-05"><date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> letter</title></ref> by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to his father), 
                        than between the respective hands for the poetry anthology and for <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>.</p>
                    
                    <p>The orthography of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> is distinctive for its studied attention to punctuation, which is largly neglected in the <date when="1827">1827</date> fair copies 
                        of <ref type="apparatus" target="wales_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRWALES">&#x201c;Wales&#x201d;</title></ref>, <ref type="apparatus" target="spring_blank_verse_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRSPRINGBLANKVERSE">&#x201c;Spring: Blank Verse&#x201d;</title></ref>, and the poems in <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                        In book 1 and the first eighty lines of book 2, almost every line of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> ends with punctuation, most frequently a prominent comma formed to look like book print, with a dot and a curl, although the commas 
                        hover above the baseline like a swimming tadpole. There are also semicolons, which are almost consistently formed upside down, with the comma above the point. 
                        The eccentricity of the punctuation resembles the usage in <ref type="apparatus" target="eudosia_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201c;Eudosia&#x201d;</title></ref> in <ref type="apparatus" target="msiv_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIV">MS IV</title></ref>. Here, too, the commas are typeface&#x2010;like, 
                        though they now fall on the baseline; and there are no upside&#x2010;down semicolons in <title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201c;Eudosia&#x201d;</title>, although a new oddity turns up in the form of a two&#x2010;point ellipsis, like a colon on its side, its function unclear. 
                        (<title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> is also punctuated with colons, but their rhetorical or grammatical function is obscure.) 
                        What most tellingly links the punctuation practice in <ref type="apparatus" target="eudosia_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201c;Eudosia&#x201d;</title></ref> with that in <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> 
                        is that, in both cases, the dense but confusing marks abruptly give out altogether after several pages of fair&#x2010;copying, suggesting that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> added the punctuation all at once, 
                        layering the marks over top of the already fair&#x2010;copied text. Evidently, he had not yet learned to integrate punctuation as a rhetorical and grammatical element of writing, 
                        but treated it effectively as a decorative feature in fair copy, as if to enhance the imitation of typeface. He used almost no punctuation when drafting the poem,

                        (whether he meant the beginning or termination of that project), a timeline takes shape starting with <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s first use of pen and ink, 
                        which his <persName corresp="#MR">mother</persName> documented in <date when="1827-04">April 1827</date> (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</ref>). This is the period when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                        composed <ref type="apparatus" target="wales_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRWALES">&#x201c;Wales&#x201d;</title></ref> and

                        and sent the poems in a <ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1827-05_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_jjr_1827-05"><date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> letter</title></ref> to his father,

                        While that tour was delayed until <date notBefore="1827-08" notAfter="1827-11">August&#x2013;November</date>, its product in 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref> is 
                        orthographically and thematically more akin to <title type="poem" corresp="#JRWALES">&#x201c;Wales&#x201d;</title> and 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSPRINGBLANKVERSE">&#x201c;Spring: Blank Verse&#x201d;</title> than to <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>, 
                        which shares a style of punctuation and other features with <title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201c;Eudosia&#x201d;</title>. (The latter two works are also alike in being divided into &#x201c;books&#x201d;.) 
                        This suggests that, despite the lack of a physical separation between the poetry anthology and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> 
                        in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, the projects were separated by a number of months, falling between the Ruskins&#x02BC; return to <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName> 
                        from <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> in <date when="1827-11">November 1827</date> and the composition of <title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201c;Eudosia&#x201d;</title> in <date when="1828-09">September 1828</date>.</p>
                    
                    <p>This first stage of composition and fair&#x2010;copying appears clearly demarcated in <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref>, 
                        with books 1&#x2013;2 extending from the title, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;THE MONASTERY&#x201D;</title>,  to almost the end of the notebook (pp. 70&#x2013;80). 
                        On p. 80, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> concludes with a colophon, &#x201c;<hi rend="caps">END OF BOOK SECOND</hi> / <hi rend="smallcaps">HERNE HILL</hi> / <hi rend="smallcaps">DULWICH</hi>&#x201d;. 
                        Inserted above the &#x201c;<hi rend="caps">END OF BOOK SECOND</hi>&#x201d; is a direction to the reader to &#x201c;go back to page 52&#x201d; 
                        (since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had run out of available space at the end of the notebook), 
                        and on that earlier page the poem resumes with book 3, and extends through book 4, which breaks off incomplete on p. 58, after 52 lines of verse.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p>A hiatus in composition would not necessarily have corresponded with the end of fair&#x2010;copying book 2, given that, in any case, the fair&#x2010;copying was delimited 
                        by the physical end of the red book. Nonetheless, it seems probable that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> signaled a significant break at the end of book 2 by adding the &#x201c;publication&#x201d; information 
                        &#x201c;<hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">HERNE HILL</placeName></hi> / <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName corresp="#DULWIICH">DULWICH</placeName></hi>&#x201d;. No evidence proves when he inserted the direction to &#x201c;go back to page 52&#x201d;, 
                        but handwriting evidence in book 3 suggests that he took up that phase at a different time and under other circumstances. This division in the stages 
                        of composition is further supported by the two separate surviving witnesses of rough draft in <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title></ref>, 
                        <ref type="witness" target="now_must_we_leave_poor_martin_there_msia.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIAA2">&#x201c;now must we leave poor martin there&#x201d;</title></ref> and 
                        <ref type="witness" target="come_on_good_horse_and_let_us_see_msia.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIAA1">&#x201c;come on good horse and let us see&#x201d;</title></ref>. 
                        The first, which is a draft of a portion of book 2, is written in cursive with pencil; the second, which is a draft of a portion of book 3, 
                        is written in cursive with pen and ink. When <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first began to use pen and ink in <date when="1827">1827</date>, he restricted his penmanship to fair&#x2010;copying in print letters, 
                        while continuing to rely on pencil for cursive script. Later, he transitioned to pen and ink for both draft in cursive and fair copy in print lettering 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</ref>). 
                        An example of the former is <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1827-05_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_jjr_1827-05"><date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> letter</title></ref> to his father, 
                        in which he fair&#x2010;copied the poems <ref type="apparatus" target="wales_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRWALES">&#x201c;Wales&#x201d;</title></ref> and 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="spring_blank_verse_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRSPRINGBLANKVERSE">&#x201c;Spring: Blank Verse&#x201d;</title></ref>, in ink print lettering, 
                        but wrote the body text of the letter in pencil cursive. An example of the latter is the <date notBefore="1828-01-01" notAfter="1829-12-31">1828&#x2013;29</date> handmade pamphlet, <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS II</title></ref>, 
                        which includes ink cursive draft of <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="eudosia_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201C;Eudosia&#x201d;</title></ref> and

                        which are fair&#x2010;copied in ink print lettering elsewhere.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since the first stage of composition probably comprised books 1&#x2013;2 in <date when="1828">1828</date>, what occasioned the work? A conjecture based on internal evidence, 
                        and in keeping with the physical evidence for dating and composition, is the death of <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_jessie_note.php"><persName corresp="#JRP">Janet (&#x201c;Jessie&#x201d;) Richardson</persName></ref>, 
                        the sister of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, in <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> 
                        on <date when="1828-05-18">18 May 1828</date>. As internal evidence of this connection, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> condensed and rearranged opening episodes of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s novel to emphasize its supernatural and spiritual aspects 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#ARRANGEMENTOFEPISODES"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s Arrangement of Episodes from <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s Novel</ref>). In addition, 
                        as an internal reflection of the immediate consequence of <persName corresp="#JRP">Jessie</persName>&#x02bc;s death&#x2014;the Ruskins&#x02bc; adoption of the only surviving Richardson daughter, 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_mary_note.php"><persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName></ref>, into the <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName> household&#x2014;<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s 
                        book 2 is a detailed rendering of an episode that tangentially concerns adoption. In the novel, a benign captain of an English raiding party, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#STAWARTHBOLTON">Stawarth Bolton</persName>, 
                        confronts <persName type="fictional" corresp="#ELSPETGLENDINNING">Elspet Glendinning</persName> and her two sons, and half&#x2010;jokingly offers to adopt either the &#x201c;blue eyed&#x201d; and reverential younger brother, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#EDWARDGLENDINNING">Edward</persName>, 
                        or the &#x201c;black eyed&#x201d; and feisty older brother, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HALBERTGLENDINNING">Halbert</persName>. For <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>, the purpose of the episode was primarily to dramatize the English policy, following their 
                        victory at the <date when="1547-09-10">Battle of Pinkie Cleuch</date>, of balancing assurances of protection for compliant Scots, especially <orgName corresp="#PROTESTANTISM">Protestants</orgName>, with threats of destruction against defiant 
                        Scots patriots (see <ref type="internal" target="#HISTORICALCONTEXT">Discussion: The Historical Context of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s Novel</ref>).</p>

                        take up the available leaves in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> that fall between pages containing

                        By interspersing the date <date when="1829-03-09">9 March 1829</date> among that group of poems, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was evidently concerned to demonstrate his success in meeting this deadline 
                        (see the commentary on the first poem copied in the <date when="1829-03-09">March 9</date> group,

                    <p>But despite his promise, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> left <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> unfinished, 
                        with marginal line numbering trailing into unfilled space on p. 58 and three available pages left blank. 
                        By this time, his attention must have been diverted from the narrative poem&#x2014;which, in any case, conceptually presented an endless drudgery, with thirty chapters remaining 
                        in <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s novel to be versified, not to mention the novel&#x02bc;s sequel, <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTABBOT"><hi rend="italic">The Abbot</hi></title>&#x2014;and 
                        he was now absorbed in composing a major loco&#x2010;descriptive poem for his father&#x02bc;s <date when="1829-05-10">10 May 1829</date> birthday,

                        He turned aside from a gothic narrative, which for him was entangled with connections in <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> that had been severed by death, 
                        in exchange for a poem in the picturesque mode for his father&#x02bc;s birthday, a poem that reopened a desire for the <geogName corresp="#LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</geogName> that had been thwarted during the

                        A portion that was fair&#x2010;copied does survive, however, in <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title></ref>, as a one&#x2010;sheet manuscript,

                        containing lines from &#x201C;Book Third&#x201D; in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>. This manuscript exhibits significant revision.</p>
                    
                    <p>On the verso of this manuscript, a line group starts with &#x201c;<persName type="fictional" corresp="#MTACKET">martin</persName> took his task as guide&#x201d;, 
                        lines 20&#x2013;21 as fair&#x2010;copied and numbered in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version of book 3. In draft, this couplet is followed by a horizontal rule, 
                        and then by lines 14&#x2013;19 and 22&#x2013;25 of book 3 (as fair&#x2010;copied). The text continues onto the recto with line 26, 
                        &#x201c;come on good horse and let us see&#x201d;; and the text continues to the bottom of the recto, through line 59 as fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>. 
                        The text continues onto the verso again, with lines 60&#x2013;62 at the top of the verso, above the line group starting with lines 20&#x2013;21. 
                        Thus, the text of lines 14&#x2013;62 loop around the two sides of the manuscript.</p>
                    
                    <p>Physical characteristics of the manuscript do not necessarily lend themselves, however, to a straightforward interpretation of the sequence of composition. 
                        The hand is <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s cursive throughout, but on the verso, the medium is entirely pencil, including both the beginning of the passage, lines 20&#x2013;21, 14&#x2013;19, and 22&#x2013;25, 
                        and the ending lines of the passage, 60&#x2013;62. On the recto, the medium is entirely ink, lines 26&#x2013;59. Moreover, the sheet has been sheared and torn at the edges, 
                        resulting in loss of portions of the verso&#x02bc;s pencil text, where the writing had extended into the lost edges, whereas on the recto the ink text 
                        did not suffer from the tearing. Rather, on this side, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears to have fitted 
                        his writing to the margins that were left following the mutilation. Based on the physical evidence, then, one interpretation of the sequence of composition 
                        suggests that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> reused the sheet after it was torn&#x2014;damage that partially obscured the penciled lines on the verso, 
                        but leaving him with a blank side, the recto, to compose the subsequent text in ink 
                        (see <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php">MS IA Apparatus</ref>).</p><!-- DCH: specify section of apparatus when ready -->
                    
                    <p>This interpretation, which assumes straightforward continuity of composition&#x2014;from verso, to recto, and back to verso, with intervening mutilation of the sheet&#x2014;is 
                        not contradicted by the three lines (60&#x2013;62) continued at the top of the verso, since those lines are complete, unaffected by the tearing. 
                        This reconstruction does fail to explain, however, why <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would have switched from pen and ink back to pencil 
                        for the final three lines on the verso. It seems odd that he would have put down his pen at the bottom of the recto and returned to pencil.</p>
                    
                    <p>As an alternative explanation, the ink text on the recto may be viewed as representing, not part of a continuous act of composition looping around both sides of the sheet, 
                        but a discontinuous intervention. The ink text might represent a copy or new version of a witness, now unknown, that had carried on with the text from the verso, starting from line 26, 
                        <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIAA1">&#x201c;come on good horse and let us see&#x201d;</title>. The ink text, moreover, contains significant revision in itself, 
                        in the form of complex substitutions. These changes are encoded in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> witness and discussed in an accompanying textual gloss. 
                        If, in addition, the ink text represents an intervention prior to this revision, then the manuscript pays double witness to perplexity that 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> encountered in versifying this section of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s novel. See

                            <persName corresp="#KH8">Henry</persName> hoped to break <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>&#x02bc;s traditional alliance with <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> and annex the country as part of assuring the Tudor succession. 
                            In <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>, a treaty to this effect was guided by <persName corresp="#JHEA">James Hamilton, earl of Arran</persName> (<date notBefore="1519" notAfter="1575-01-22">1519&#x2013;75</date>), 
                            who had been appointed governor of <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> and tutor to the child <persName corresp="MQS">Mary</persName> upon the death of <persName corresp="#KJ5">James V</persName>. 
                            As a <orgName corresp="#PROTESTANTISM">Protestant</orgName>, <persName corresp="#JHEA">Arran</persName> had been the first to propose the future union of the two royal heirs. 
                            At home, however, an anti&#x2010;English faction quickly formed against him, composed of clergy and nobles. The Scottish parliament 
                            did prepare a treaty agreeing to the marriage, but preserving Scottish sovereignty, terms that <persName corresp="#KH8">Henry</persName> was unlikely to accept, as he pursued increasingly aggressive conditions for the agreement. 
                            The arrangement foundered, with the Scottish parliament now condemning the treaty; Mary was crowned queen of Scots; 
                            and the anti&#x2010;English, pro&#x2010;Catholic faction reaffirmed the <orgName corresp="#AULDALLIANCE">Auld Alliance</orgName> with <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>. 
                            <persName corresp="#KH8">Henry</persName> was incensed, determined to force the marriage, and to claim overlordship of <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> 
                            with no allowance for separate sovereignty. Accordingly, he appointed troops under <persName corresp="#ESEH">Edward Seymour, earl of Hertford</persName> (<date notBefore="1500" notAfter="1552-01-22">1500&#x2013;52</date>), to &#x201c;put all to fyre and swoord&#x201d;.

                            As dramatized by the novel&#x02bc;s opening encounter between an occupying English soldier and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#ELSPETGLENDINNING">Elspet</persName> and her two sons&#x2014;the

                            hatred of the English invaders and the reaffirmation of the <orgName corresp="#AULDALLIANCE">Auld Alliance</orgName> put Scottish <orgName corresp="#PROTESTANTISM">Protestants</orgName> on the defensive,

                        <p>In his selection of episodes, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> lifts events out of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s narrative sequence, 
                            and begins with an episode centered on the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WHITELADY">White Lady</persName>. The apparition is the spectral protector 
                            of the <orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">Avenel</orgName> family, and she is particularly watchful over <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LADYAVENEL">Lady Avenel</persName>&#x02bc;s vernacular bible&#x2014;the

Overall, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s selections de&#x2010;emphasize the novel&#x02bc;s staging of complex political conflict surrounding the Scottish Reformation, 
                            and instead favor the story&#x02bc;s supernatural elements.</p>
                            
                            <p>The focus seems chosen in part for the sake of the supernaturalism in itself, 
                            although the choice also bears the effect of favoring Scottish <orgName corresp="#PROTESTANTISM">Protestantism</orgName> at the cost of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s purposes, 
                            which are more latitudinarian respecting religion. As summarized in <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s

                            the novel&#x02bc;s aim is &#x201c;to conjoin two characters [i.e., the monastery Sub&#x2010;Prior <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FATHEREUSTACE">Eustace</persName> and the Reform preacher <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HENRYWARDEN">Henry Warden</persName>]

                            should, with the same sincerity and purity of intention, dedicate themselves, the one to the support of the sinking fabric of the <orgName corresp="#ROMANCATHOLICCHURCH">Catholic Church</orgName>,

                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> tips the scales of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s ecumenical aim by coloring particular passages with <orgName corresp="#PROTESTANTISM">Protestant</orgName> discourse and by foregrounding in the overall arrangement the supernatural interventions

                            &#x201c;the abbot&#x201d;, and so on. The neglect may suggest that he avoided personalizing the <orgName corresp="#ROMANCATHOLICCHURCH">Roman Catholic</orgName> characters, 
                            given that he does name each of the Scottish characters. Confusion may also have arisen, however, from his unfamiliarity with monastic titles, which he gets wrong in places. 
                            He also mistakes the military rank of the English soldier, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#STAWARTHBOLTON">Stawarth Bolton</persName>.</p>

                                    The action begins with a monk (<persName type="fictional" corresp="#FATHERPHILIP">Father Philip</persName>, the sacristan of

                                    Preparing to ford the river on his mule, he encounters the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WHITELADY">White Lady</persName>. 
                                    Supposing her to be a woman stranded on the bank by the churlish bridge&#x2010;ward, he offers to carry her across the stream,

                                    to crush heretical Reform ideas infiltrating the halidome. Cutting to the end of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s chapter 7,

                        <p>For the high&#x2010;spirited young <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, episodes that struck sober reviewers as childish,

                            At the same time, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> felt the mystery of the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WHITELADY">White Lady</persName>, as suggested by the incantation with which he begins his poem. 
                            In capturing this mood of the novel, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s response might be compared to that of the reviewer for <title type="periodical" corresp="#BLACKWOODSMAGAZINE"><hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x02bc;s Edinburgh Magazine</hi></title>,

                            but nothing at the same time can be more quiet. The different scenes spread themselves out in a fine variegated and easy succession&#x201d;. 
                            The reviewer relates this unfolding of varying scenes and moods to what he or she imagines <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s experience to have been when composing the novel.

                            contributed to delaying the Ruskins&#x02bc; <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> journey in <date when="1827">1827</date>, and then solemnized the long two&#x2010;month visit in <date notBefore="1827-09" notAfter="1827-10">September and October</date>

                            This death too, then, would have contributed to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s feelings when choosing to summarize <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s novel in the next year.</p>
                        
                        <p>Most engimatic of all, perhaps, is <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s abandonment of his project (in fair copy, and so far as we know, also in draft) just short of bearing witness

                            One might speculate that the omission was related to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s alarm over his father&#x02bc;s vulnerability, exposed to him 
                            when witnessing <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> in &#x201c;distress of sobbing tears&#x201d; over his sister <persName corresp="#JRP">Jessie</persName>&#x02bc;s death&#x2014;&#x201c;the first time I had ever seen him&#x201d; so,

                            Such hostility and suspicion would not have been shared by <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>, who as a <orgName corresp="#SCOTTISHEPISCOPALCHURCH">Scottish Episcopalian</orgName> approved of moderation and compromise,

                            While <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was perhaps not equal to or interested in versifying the more polemical passages of the novel&#x2014;passages that,

                            That a ten&#x2010;year&#x2010;old achieved this emphasis by concentrating on episodes involving the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WHITELADY">White Lady</persName>&#x02bc;s interventions on behalf of the <orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">Avenels</orgName> would,

                                            but giving voice to those qualities of human existence which remain, even in the present day, beyond the purview of reason.</p>

                        <p>As a comparatively naive, but intensive reader, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> perhaps held an advantage over <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s critics 
                            in responding emotionally and without embarrassment to this representation of religious mystery. Textual evidence exists that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            specifically rejected a rational, historicized explanation of spiritual phenomena in the novel. In the the draft fragment, 
                            <ref type="witness" target="come_on_good_horse_and_let_us_see_msia.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIAA1">&#x201c;come on good horse and let us see&#x201d;</title></ref>, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> initially wrote that it was the family &#x201c;<orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">avenel</orgName>s fate / 
                            to see things that nobody saw / except themselves, and would say pshaw&#x201d;. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> deleted this gruff expression of skepticism 
                            and, in an intricate substitution, replaced the couplet with &#x201c;but it was great <orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">avenel</orgName>s fate / 
                            to have a spirit in their line / and so it was this odd time&#x201d;. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s source passage in the novel 
                            contained a cue that would have allowed for the &#x201c;pshaw&#x201d;, or at least for a more politely noncommital expression, 
                            by relegating the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WHITELADY">White Lady</persName>&#x02bc;s manifestations 
                            to an &#x201c;<hi rend="italic">old</hi> time&#x201d; rather than an &#x201c;<hi rend="italic">odd</hi> time&#x201d;. In an exchange between

                            on the Halloween night when <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MARYAVENEL">Mary Avenel</persName> allegedly saw the ghost of her <persName type="fictional" corresp="#SIMONGLENDINNING">father</persName>, 
                            <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TTACKET">Tibb</persName> defends the <orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">Avenels</orgName>&#x02bc; privileged connection with the spirit world: 
                            &#x201c;&#x2018;Mony braw services&#x2019;&#x201d; the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WHITELADY">White Lady</persName>

                            56 [vol. 1, chap. 4]). Restricting the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WHITELADY">White Lady</persName>&#x02bc;s actions to the &#x201c;auld histories&#x201d; of the novel&#x02bc;s pre&#x2010;history or even 
                            its sixteenth&#x2010;century setting would have served as a typical disclaimer in any other <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> novel. In draft revision, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> specifically rejected this choice, however, supplanting a scornful &#x201c;pshaw&#x201d;, 
                            not with a tolerance for beliefs of an &#x201c;old&#x201d; time, but with wonder over the mystery of an &#x201c;odd&#x201d; time  
                            (see also <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB2-DRAFT">Stage Two of Composition: Surviving Draft</ref>).</p>
                        
                        <p>At the same time, other religious aspects of the novel presented <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> with choices about which he may have felt more ambivalent. As already suggested, 
                            the project&#x02bc;s connection with <ref type="internal" target="#SPIRITUALCONTEXT">Recent Family Deaths</ref> is enigmatic; and the point at which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> abandoned the project, at least in fair copy, 
                            suggests that he may have felt a particular challenge assimilating an episode that raises the spectre of a father&#x02bc;s death. The novel may also have challenged <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            by presenting conflicts in his identification with the protagonists. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HALBERTGLENDINNING">Halbert Glendinning</persName> 
                            grows into the <orgName corresp="#PROTESTANTISM">Protestant</orgName> hero, a journey that begins with his summoning the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WHITELADY">White Lady</persName> 
                            by pronouncing &#x201c;mystical rhymes&#x201d;, as does <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> at the end of

                            when invoking the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WITCHOFTHEALPS">Witch of the Alps</persName>. According to the narrator, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HALBERTGLENDINNING">Halbert</persName> 
                            &#x201c;&#x2018;came hither a boy&#x2019;&#x201d; to confront the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WHITELADY">White Lady</persName> 
                            but means to &#x201c;&#x2018;return a man&#x2019;&#x201d;, determined to gain the the spirit&#x02bc;s aid in 
                            &#x201c;learn[ing] the contents of that mysterious volume&#x201d;, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LADYAVENEL">Alice Avenel</persName>&#x02bc;s vernacular bible, 
                            and to understand &#x201c;why the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LADYAVENEL">Lady of Avenel</persName> loved it&#x2014;why the priests feared, and would have stolen it&#x201d;. 
                            Compared to this scene, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#EDWARDGLENDINNING">Edward Glendinning</persName> exhibits no less resolution than his brother, 
                            when defending <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MARYAVENEL">Mary Avenel</persName>&#x02bc;s possession of her mother&#x02bc;s bible against the pressure 
                            by Sub&#x2010;Prior <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FATHEREUSTACE">Eustace</persName> to &#x201c;borrow&#x201d; it. 
                            Yet, for a <orgName corresp="#PROTESTANTISM">Protestant</orgName> reader, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#EDWARDGLENDINNING">Edward</persName>&#x02bc;s independence 
                            is ominously compromised by his acceptance of a pledge that <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FATHEREUSTACE">Eustace</persName> offers in place of the plain &#x201c;black book&#x201d;&#x2014;a 
                            &#x201c;gay missal&#x201d;, filled with images that excite his &#x201c;eager curiosity&#x201d;

                        <p>Ultimately, tbe novel palliates Protestant anxiety about idolatry. Although <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FATHEREUSTACE">Eustace</persName>&#x02bc;s 
                            distraction succeeds in gaining him temporary possession of the bible, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#EDWARDGLENDINNING">Edward</persName> 
                            is not so &#x201c;lost in wonder&#x201d; over the missal&#x02bc;s pictures that he forgets that 
                            &#x201c;&#x2018;<persName type="fictional" corresp="#MARYAVENEL">Mary</persName> may like that [black book] best which was her mother&#x02bc;s&#x2019;&#x201d;. 
                            Terrors do not lie in <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FATHEREUSTACE">Eustace</persName>&#x02bc;s parting promise to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#EDWARDGLENDINNING">Edward</persName>&#x2014;to 
                            &#x201c;&#x2018;teach you to write and read such beautiful letters as you see there written, and to paint them blue, green, and yellow, and to blazon them with gold&#x2019;&#x201d;. 
                            The greatest temptation raised in <persName type="fictional" corresp="#EDWARDGLENDINNING">Edward</persName>&#x02bc;s mind by the prospect of making graven images is merely to learn to &#x201c;paint <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MARYAVENEL">Mary</persName>&#x02bc;s picture&#x201d;&#x2014;<persName type="fictional" corresp="#MARYAVENEL">Mary Avenel</persName>&#x02bc;s, 
                            not the <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#VIRGINMARY">Virgin</persName>&#x02bc;s&#x2014;a fancy that reminds him to exact a parting promise from <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FATHEREUSTACE">Eustace</persName> to return the bible. 
                            Even at the end of the novel, when <persName type="fictional" corresp="#EDWARDGLENDINNING">Edward</persName>, now a novitiate, 
                            learns that he has lost <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MARYAVENEL">Mary</persName> to both his brother and the Protestant faith, 
                            and the <persName corresp="#JSEM1">Earl of Moray</persName>&#x02bc;s army is closing on <placeName type="fictional" corresp="#KENNAQUHAIR">Kennaquhair</placeName> 
                            and threatening destruction of the abbey, <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> brings the preacher, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HENRYWARDEN">Henry Warden</persName>, 
                            on the scene for little purpose other than to have even this most fanatical of the Protestant characters deliver &#x201c;&#x2018;testimony&#x2019;&#x201d; 
                            against &#x201c;&#x2018;wanton devastation&#x2019;&#x201d; of the building and its treasures: &#x201c;&#x2018;I would have these stately shrines deprived 
                            of the idols which, no longer simply regarded as the effigies of the good and the wise, have become the objects of foul idolatry. I would otherwise have 
                            its ornaments subsist, unless as they are, or may be, a snare to the souls of men; and especially do I condemn those ravages which have been made by the heady fury of the people&#x2019;&#x201d;
