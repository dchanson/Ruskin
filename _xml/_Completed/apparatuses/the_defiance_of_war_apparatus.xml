                        <p>The latest credible threat of invasion of British shores had ended, of course, in <date when="1815">1815</date> 
                            with the <date when="1815-06-18">Battle of Waterloo</date>, which closed the <date notBefore="1799-11-09" notAfter="1815-06-18">Napoleonic Wars</date>. 
                            Soon thereafter, in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> in <date when="1816">1816</date>, the <orgName corresp="#PEACESOCIETY">Peace Society</orgName> was founded as a coalition of <orgName corresp="#SOCIETYOFFRIENDS">Quakers</orgName> and other <orgName corresp="#DISSENTER">Dissenters</orgName>, 
                            such as <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalists</orgName>&#x2014;the Ruskins&#x02bc; church at this time&#x2014;<orgName corresp="#BAPTISM">Baptists</orgName>, and <orgName corresp="#UNITARIANISM">Unitarians</orgName>, as well as 
                            <orgName corresp="#EVANGELICALANGLICANISM">Anglican Evangelicals</orgName>. <persName corresp="#PBROCK">Peter Brock</persName> characterizes the society as marking the emergence of an organized peace movement 
                            as compared with earlier, sporadic assertions of <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christian</orgName> pacifism by individuals, and as partaking of the reform optimism 
                            of the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</date> generally. A middle&#x2010;class movement, and never a broadly populist one, the society was intent initially on converting British opinion 
                            through pamphleteering. As the flush of optimism surrounding the <date notBefore="1814-11" notAfter="1815-06">Vienna Settlement</date> gave way to rising nationalism on the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName>, accompanied by friction 
                            between reactionary state policies and republican movements, the <orgName corresp="#PEACESOCIETY">Peace Society</orgName> advocated nonintervention. It finally found a political platform 
                            through alliance with free&#x2010;trade internationalists (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BROCKPACIFISM"><persName corresp="#PBROCK">Brock</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#BROCKPACIFISM"><hi rend="italic">Pacifism in Europe</hi></title></ref>, 376&#x2013;86).</p>
                        
                        <p>In <date notBefore="1826-09" notAfter="1826-12">late 1826</date>, near the time of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, an international incident that had the potential to affect trade 
                            occurred in the East, in connection with the <date notBefore="1821-03-06" notAfter="1832-05-07">Greek War for Independence</date> from Turkish domination. 
                            While no threat to <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>, the war would have interested the Ruskins for its associations with 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="byron_noteAEH.php"><persName corresp="#GGB">Lord Byron</persName></ref>, who had died in <placeName corresp="#MISSOLONGHI">Missolonghi</placeName> in
                            <date when="1824">1824</date>. In the <date notBefore="1821-03-06" notAfter="1832-05-07">Greek conflict</date>, <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> was striving to avoid an outbreak 
                            between <placeName corresp="#TURKEY">Turkey</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#RUSSIA">Russia</placeName>, whose new tsar, <persName corresp="#TS1">Nicholas I</persName>, was willing
                            to push hostilities. In <date when="1826-10">October 1826</date>, <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> pressured <placeName corresp="#TURKEY">Turkey</placeName> to accept Russian conditions in the <date when="1826-10-07">Convention of Akkerman</date>. This assured Russian influence in the
                            <geogName corresp="#CAUCASUS">Caucasus</geogName> and the opening of the <geogName corresp="#BOSPHORUSSTRT">Straits of Bosphorus</geogName> to trade, which might have interested the Ruskins&#x02BC; mercantile household.
                            As it turned out, <placeName corresp="#RUSSIA">Russia</placeName> continued to press hostilities in the name of the Greek cause, and <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> joined <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#RUSSIA">Russia</placeName> to declare
                            joint mediation, according to a treaty signed in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> in <date when="1827-07">July 1827</date>. (In the subsequent history, the Turks refused mediation but were defeated by
                            allied fleets at <placeName corresp="#NAVARINO">Navarino</placeName> in <date when="1827-10">October 1827</date>. The <date when="1829-09-14">Treaty of Adrianople</date>, rendering <placeName corresp="#GREECE">Greece</placeName> autonomous, was signed
                            two years later, in <date when="1829-09">September 1829</date>.)</p>

                        <p>While <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have heard his parents discusss these international affairs or listened to a clergyman defend the <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christian</orgName> ethics of pacifism, 
                            he was perhaps most influenced by attitudes toward war expressed in poetry and tales by women writers of the period whose message, like his, was centered on protection of the home. 
                            Children who grew up in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> during the <date notBefore="1799-11-09" notAfter="1815-06-18">Napoleonic</date> and immediately post&#x2010;Napoleonic eras 
                            were exposed to the anxieties of women who, as <persName corresp="#LC">Linda Colley</persName> remarks, 
                            &#x201C;seem to have believed that their own security and the security of the family unit were at stake in this 
                            <date notBefore="1789-05-05" notAfter="1815-06-18">French war</date> as they had not been in earlier conflicts. 
                            In part, this was because the risk of a French invasion of <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> was so much greater in this war than ever before. 
                            But crucial, too, as an ingredient in female anxiety was the destruction of <persName corresp="#MAJ">Marie&#x2010;Antoinette</persName> and the rest of the French Royal Family&#x201D;&#x2014;a regicide that 
                            <persName corresp="#EB">Edmund Burke</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="essay" rend="italic" corresp="#BURKEREFLECTIONS">Reflections on the Revolution in France</title> 
                            (<date when="1790">1790</date>) taught the elder Ruskins&#x02BC; generation to stigmatize specifically in terms &#x201C;of a queen who was also a wife and mother being driven by force from her home&#x201D;

                        <p>One source of women&#x02bc;s anti&#x2010;war writing to which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had access was <title type="book" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title> by the <orgName corresp="#UNITARIANISM">Unitarian</orgName> educationalists,

                            While it is impossible to specify when and with what extent of supervision <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> dipped into this miscellaneous &#x201c;juvenile budget&#x201d; 
                            of dialogues, fables, and poems, its anti&#x2010;war pieces were vividly prominent. For example, the dialogue 
                            <title type="lesson" corresp="#BARBAULDTHINGSBYTHEIRRIGHTNAMES">&#x201c;Things by Their Right Names&#x201d;</title> (traditionally ascribed to <persName corresp="#ALB">Barbauld</persName>&#x02bc;s authorship rather than <persName corresp="#JAIKIN">Aikin</persName>&#x02bc;s), 
                            a Father obliges the wish of his son, Charles, for a story about &#x201c;bloody murder&#x201c;; however, 
                            in place of the generic props and characters of romance that Charles anticipates, 
                            the father substitutes unexpected &#x201c;right names&#x201d; for elements in the story. 
                            As Charles pieces together these words, he realizes his father is not relating a thriller but describing a battle:

                            Implicit in the father&#x02bc;s lesson is the real threat that war poses to the English home,

                            The pretensions of <persName corresp="#KA3">Alexander the Great</persName> are mocked by a lowly Thracian, who has been captured for stealing.

                            . . . that of bad husbands and fathers [being] by much the most frequent and worst&#x201d; (5:85&#x2013;90, 88).</p>

                            opens with a boy bursting into &#x201c;his father&#x02bc;s house&#x201d; to proclaim the &#x201c;glorious news&#x201d; of &#x201c;a complete victory&#x201d;, 
                            only to be cross&#x2010;examined by his father. Rationally, the father unpacks the news by weighing the illusory benefits of the victory against its hugely painful costs. 
                            The father closes his case with a story illustrating the sufferings of a soldier, who returns home from battle grotesquely wounded, 
                            and whose death causes the decline of his fiance and parents. Again, the greatest cost of war is pictured as the fall of the peaceful and prosperous home (4:52&#x2013;63).

                            during the <date notBefore="1789-05-05" notAfter="1799-11-09">Revolutionary period</date>. The language for the children&#x02bc;s lessons is simpler, and their ironies less biting than what <persName corresp="#ALB">Barbauld</persName> indulged in her anti&#x2010;war political pamphlets. 
                            The simplicity, however, potentially increased the risk of censure for sedition during the height of the government&#x02bc;s alarm in the <date notBefore="1790" notAfter="1799">1790s</date>, 
                            since the arguments could be construed as leading unsophisticated folk astray 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#TRETHEWAYBARBAULDAMONGRADICALS"><persName corresp="#RTRETHEWAY">Trethewey</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#TRETHEWAYBARBAULDAMONGRADICALS">&#x201c;Lady Defender of the Revolution&#x201d;</title></ref>, 163&#x2013;65, 161). 
                            Certainly, <persName corresp="#ALB">Barbauld</persName>&#x02bc;s mastery of a shared Radical discourse drew censure because her rhetoric was indistinguishable from that of male writers. 
                            In her own time, she was accused of having &#x201c;unsexed&#x201d; herself. Famously, <persName corresp="#JWCROKER">John Wilson Croker</persName> attacked her in his review of her poem,

                            the book was initially well received primarily among liberal <orgName corresp="#DISSENTER">Dissenter</orgName> families. The book proved objectionable to <orgName corresp="#EVANGELICALANGLICANISM">Anglican Evangelical</orgName> readers, 
                            but primarily for what it did not say, such as connecting scientific topics explicitly with religious commentary. 
                            In any case, controversy had waned by the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, 
                            when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> encountered the work, and <title type="book" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title> achieved the status of a classic, 
                            reprinted in thousands of copies (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FYFETRACTS"><persName corresp="#AFYFE">Fyfe</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#FYFETRACTS">&#x201C;Tracts, Classics and Brands&#x201D;</title></ref>, 220&#x2013;21). 
                            <persName corresp="#JAIKIN">Aikin</persName> and <persName corresp="#ALB">Barbauld</persName> may also have steered clear of sedition by confining the anti&#x2010;war pieces to historical examples&#x2014;the ancient <placeName corresp="#MACEDONIA">Macedonia</placeName>

However the implications of the anti&#x2010;war arguments were apprently muted for most readers, 
                            in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEDEFIANCEOFWAR">&#x201c;The Defiance of War&#x201d;</title> <persName corresp="#ALB">Barbauld</persName> and <persName corresp="#JAIKIN">Aikin</persName>&#x02bc;s discourse appears largely ignored in details. One can perhaps glimpse the Radical contention 
                            that only the ruling class benefits by war in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s remark that war &#x201c;like[s] better a king to be&#x201d;. Overwhelmingly, however, 
                            the poem&#x02bc;s pacifist message is not only unsupported by argument but even contradicted by a discordant militarism, such as the threat 
                            that any invading army &#x201c;here shall suffering die&#x201d;. Moreover, the gender positioning seems aggressively masculine, 
                            with the promise that war will in its turn be conquered by &#x201c;he&#x201d; who is &#x201c;the strongest of us&#x201d;&#x2014;presumably referring to the patriarch of the household, 
                            or to a military hero of the nation.</p>
                        
                        <p>This contradiction in the poem&#x02bc;s tone might be categorized with the conflict in work by women writers who ventured to raise their voices against war, 
                            while confessing themselves drawn to the glamour of the military 
                            (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SAUNDERSCOSTELLO"><persName corresp="#CBSAUNDERS">Saunders</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#SAUNDERSCOSTELLO">&#x201c;Louisa Stuart Costello and Women&#x02bc;s War Poetry&#x201d;</title></ref>).
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s imagination was keenly fixed on the romance of <date when="1815-06-18">Waterloo</date>,

                            that home is an &#x201c;ark of refuge&#x201d; and a &#x201c;fane of rest [that] <hi rend="italic">no</hi> raging storms invade&#x201d; (lines 76, 61). 
                            Triumphantly, the poem asserts the &#x201c;mystic power&#x201d; of domestic affections (line 252) to overcome all trials of adversity, 
                            just as domestic joy will outlast any competing sources of joy such as fame and genius. 
                            Doubt emerges only when evocation of &#x201c;maternal love&#x201d; prompts the question of &#x201c;who may charm <hi rend="italic">her</hi> sleepless pang to rest&#x201d; (lines 341, 343)

                            placement alongside poems celebrating both <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> and British pride of manufacture, appears to support <persName corresp="#LC">Linda Colley</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        argument that British identity, <placeName corresp="#NBRITAIN">North</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">South</placeName>, was forged &#x201C;not so much [by] consensus or homogeneity or centralisation at home, as [by] a strong sense of dissimilarity from those without.&#x201D; 
                        Fear of the <orgName corresp="#ROMANCATHOLICCHURCH">Catholic other</orgName> dominated over divisions between <orgName corresp="#CHURCHOFENGLAND">Anglicanism</orgName> and Dissent, and Old and New Dissent, so that Britons defended above all a &#x201C;pluralist yet aggressively Protestant polity&#x201D;; 
                        and recurrent wars with <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>, along with worries about Jacobite restoration, had kept alive the fear &#x201C;that the old popish enemy was still at the gates, more threatening than ever before&#x201D;

                        primary function of the fears expressed in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem may well have been to help to forge identity in this Scottish&#x2010;English and, at this time, Dissenter household.

                    <p>For a threat closer to home, one returns to the Catholic Other, even in <date when="1826">1826</date>. The <orgName corresp="#ROMANCATHOLICCHURCH">Catholic</orgName> fear was kept alive in the years running up to the <date when="1829-03-24">Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829</date>, perhaps all the more so in households 
                        like the Ruskins&#x02BC; that had to strain to forge together competing loyalties to form a British identity. In those post&#x2010;<date when="1815-06-18">Waterloo</date> years, <persName corresp="#LC">Colley</persName> points out, 
                        anti&#x2010;Catholic agitation was sustained by &#x201C;an abundance of women&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BRITONS"><hi rend="italic">Britons</hi></ref>, 333).

                        equivocal underhand equally devoid of sincerity or honesty &#x0026; integrity&#x201D; and capable of &#x201C;tak[ing] Satan himself into their cabals to further their purposes

                    <p>Another overdetermining possibility is that the poem also works figuratively to comment on the illness and death of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s
