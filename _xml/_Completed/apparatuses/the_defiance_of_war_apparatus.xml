                        <p>The latest credible threat of invasion of British shores had ended, of course, in <date when="1815">1815</date> 
                            with the <date when="1815-06-18">Battle of Waterloo</date>, which closed the <date notBefore="1799-11-09" notAfter="1815-06-18">Napoleonic Wars</date>. 
                            Soon thereafter, in London in 1816, the Peace Society was founded as a coalition of Quakers and other Dissenters, 
                            such as Congregationalists--the Ruskins' church at this time--Baptists, and Unitarians, as well as 
                            Anglican Evangelicals. Peter Brock characterizes the society as marking the emergence of an organized peace movement 
                            as compared with earlier, sporadic assertions of Christian pacifism by individuals, and as partaking of the reform optimism 
                            of the 1820s-30s generally. A middle-class movement, and never a broadly populist one, the society was intent initially on converting British opinion 
                            through pamphleteering. As the flush of optimism surrounding the Vienna Settlement gave way to rising nationalism on the Continent, accompanied by friction 
                            between reactionary state policies and republican movements, the Peace Society advocated nonintervention. It finally found a political platform 
                            through alliance with free-trade internationalists (Brock, Pacifism in Europe, 376-86).</p><!-- STOP -->
                        
                        <p>In <date notBefore="1826-09" notAfter="1826-12">late 1826</date>, near the time of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, an international incident that had the potential to affect trade 
                            occurred in the East, in connection with the <date notBefore="1821-03-06" notAfter="1832-05-07">Greek War for Independence</date> from Turkish domination. 
                            While no threat to <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>, the war would have interested the Ruskins for its associations with

                            to push hostilities. In <date when="1826-10">October 1826</date>, <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> pressured <placeName corresp="#TURKEY">Turkey</placeName> to accept Russian conditions in the <date when="1826-10-07">Convention of Akkerman</date>.

                            As it turned out, <placeName corresp="#RUSSIA">Russia</placeName> continued to press hostilities in the name of the Greek cause, and <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> joined <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#RUSSIA">Russia</placeName> to declare

                        <p>While <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have heard his parents discusss these international affairs or listened to a clergyman defend the Christian ethics of pacifism, 
                            he was likely more directly influenced by anti-war poetry and tales by women writers whose message, like his, was centered on protection of the home. 
                            A source of such writing he is known to have read was Evenings at Home by the Unitarian educationalists, 
                            <!-- note and persName -->Mrs. Barbauld and her brother John Aikin. 
                            While it is impossible to specify when and with what extent of supervision Ruskin dipped into this miscellaneous "juvenile budget" 
                            of dialogues, fables, and poems, its anti-war pieces are vividly prominent.</p>
                        
                        <p>For example, the dialogue "Things by Their Right Names" 
                            (traditionally credited to Barbauld's authorship rather than Aikin's), 
                            a Father obliges the wish of his son, Charles, for a story about "bloody murder"; however, 
                            in place of the generic props and characters of romance that Charles anticipates, 
                            the father substitutes unexpected "right names" for elements in the story. 
                            As Charles pieces together these words, he realizes his father is not relating a thriller but describing a battle: 
                            "'I do not know any <hi rend="italic">murders</hi> half so bloody'", the Father concludes. 
                            Implicit in the father's lesson is the real threat that war poses to the English home, 
                            as the family has gathered "'round the fire quite ready to hear'" a good story, 
                            only to find their expectations invaded by graphic images of violence 
                            (Barbauld and Aikin, Evenings at Home, 1:154-56).</p>
                        
                        <p>Other anti-war dialogues and tales in Evenings at Home--probably by Aikin, or perhaps by Aikin and Barbauld collaboratively--include 
                            include the dramatic sketch <title type="drama" corresp="#BARBAULDTWOROBBERS">"The Two Robbers"</title>, 
                            which uses a strategy similar to that of "Things by Their Right Names" of substituting blunt definitions for the evasions of self-glorifying warriors. 
                            The pretensions of Alexander the Great are mocked by a lowly Thracian, who has been captured for stealing. 
                            Alexander's conquests, the Thracian explains, are no better than the robberies committed by the captive (2:152-56). 
                            Another dialogue that deflates the gains of war, <title type="lesson" corresp="#BARBAULDPRICEOFAVICTORY">"The Price of a Victory"</title>, 
                            opens with a boy bursting into "his father's house" to proclaim the "glorious news" of "a complete victory", 
                            only to be cross-examined by his father. Rationally, the father unpacks the news by weighing the illusory benefits of the victory against its hugely painful costs. 
                            The father closes his case with a story illustrating the sufferings of a soldier, who returns home from battle grotesquely wounded, 
                            and whose death causes the decline of his fiance and parents. Again, the greatest cost of war is pictured as the fall of the peaceful and prosperous home (4:52-63).</p>
                        
                        <p>Barbauld and Aikin's anti-war rhetoric in Evenings in Home has been shown to be consistent with discourse shared among Radical reformers 
                            during the Revolutionary period. The language for the children's lessons is simpler, and their ironies less biting than what Barbauld indulged in her anti-war political pamphlets. 
                            The simplicity, however, potentially increased the risk of censure for sedition during the height of the government's alarm in the 1790s, 
                            since the arguments could be construed as leading unsophisticated folk astray 
                            (Trethewey, "Lady Defender of the Revolution", 163-65, 161). 
                            Certainly, Barbauld's mastery of a shared Radical discourse drew censure because her rhetoric was indistinguishable from that of male writers. 
                            In her own time, she was accused of having "unsexed" herself; and over the course of the century, 
                            she came to be characterized as a humorless bore. Subversive elements in the children's writings were passed over, 
                            probably because this work was viewed as her proper sphere, unlike the political writings 
                            (see Mahon, "Sermon and Story", 29-30; McCarthy, "'A High-Minded Christian Lady'", 179-80).</p>
                        
                        <p>But while the case against warfare and militarism was available to Ruskin in Evenings at Home, and may have influenced him, 
                            his poem reflects little, if any, of the rational and religious discourse that was held in common by liberals and pacifists. The poem, rather, 
                            is anti-war without being anti-militarist. One can perhaps glimpse the common pacifist contention that only the ruling class benefits by war 
                            in the poem's comment that war "like[s] better a king to be". Overwhelmingly, however, the pacifist message is contradicted by discordantly belligerent threats 
                            that any invading army "here shall suffering die". The gender positioning seems aggressively masculine, 
                            with the promise that war will in its turn be conquered by "he" who is "the strongest of us"--presumably referring to the patriarch of the household, 
                            or to a military hero of the nation.</p>
                        
                        <p>This contradiction in the poem's tone might be categorized with the conflict in work by women writers who ventured to raise their voices against war, 
                            while confessing themselves drawn to the glamour of the military 
                            (see Saunders, "Louisa Stuart Costello and Women's War Poetry").
                            Ruskin's imagination was keenly fixed on the romance of <date when="1815-06-18">Waterloo</date>,

                            appears as a trope in Felicia Hemans's poems about the Napoleonic War. In "War and Peace--A Poem. Written at the Age of Fifteen",

                            For all its contradictions, Ruskin's "The Defiance of War" seems akin to women's poetry of the period that defied war more by celebrating the endurance of domestic peace 
                            than by arguing against the legitimacy of conflict--or that at least obscured their critiques of war by using medieval settings or other distancing effects 
                             For example, according to Felicia Hemans's 
                            "The Domestic Affections", published in 1812 when the Napoleonic Wars still raged, 
                            home is an "ark of refuge" and a "fane of rest [that] <hi rend="italic">no</hi> raging storms invade" (lines 76, 61). 
                            The poem asks rhetorically whether "war's dread scenes [can] the hallow'd ties efface" and 
                            whether "fields of carnage, days of toil, [can] destroy / The lov'd impressions of domestic joy?" (lines 111-14). 
                            Triumphantly, the poem asserts the "mystic power" of domestic affections (line 252) to overcome these and even stranger trials 
                            as well as to outlast competing but ephemeral sources of joy such as fame and genius. 
                            Doubt emerges only when evocation of "maternal love" prompts the question of "who may charm <hi rend="italic">her</hi> sleepless pang to rest" (lines 341, 343) 
                            (Hemans, Selected Poems, ed. Wolfson, 4-15).</p>
                        
                        <p>Women writers did not have to share Barbauld's politics to feel anxiety about the threat of war to the British home. 
                            As <persName corresp="#LC">Linda Colley</persName> remarks, during the <date notBefore="1789-05-05" notAfter="1799-11-09">Revolutionary</date>
                            and <date notBefore="1799-11-09" notAfter="1815-06-18">Napoleonic</date> Era, &#x201C;many women . . . seem to have believed that their own security and the security of the family unit 
                            were at stake in this <date notBefore="1789-05-05" notAfter="1815-06-18">French war</date> as they had not been in earlier conflicts. In part, this was because the risk of a French invasion of <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> was so much greater in this war than ever before. 
                            But crucial, too, as an ingredient in female anxiety was the destruction of <persName corresp="#MAJ">Marie&#x2010;Antoinette</persName> and the rest of the French Royal Family&#x201D;&#x2014;a regicide that 
                            <persName corresp="#EB">Edmund Burke</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="essay" rend="italic" corresp="#BURKEREFLECTIONS">Reflections on the Revolution in France</title> 
                            (<date when="1790">1790</date>) taught the elder Ruskins&#x02BC; generation to stigmatize specifically in terms &#x201C;of a queen who was also a wife and mother being driven by force from her home&#x201D;

                            placement alongside poems celebrating both <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> and British pride of manufacture, appears to support <persName corresp="#LC">Linda Colley</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        argument that British identity, <placeName corresp="#NBRITAIN">North</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">South</placeName>, was forged &#x201C;not so much [by] consensus or homogeneity or centralisation at home, as [by] a strong sense of dissimilarity from those without.&#x201D; 
                        Fear of the <orgName corresp="#ROMANCATHOLICCHURCH">Catholic other</orgName> dominated over divisions between <orgName corresp="#CHURCHOFENGLAND">Anglicanism</orgName> and Dissent, and Old and New Dissent, so that Britons defended above all a &#x201C;pluralist yet aggressively Protestant polity&#x201D;; 
                        and recurrent wars with <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>, along with worries about Jacobite restoration, had kept alive the fear &#x201C;that the old popish enemy was still at the gates, more threatening than ever before&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BRITONS">Colley, <hi rend="italic">Britons</hi></ref>, 17, 19, 25, and see p. 18). The 
                        primary function of the fears expressed in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem may well have been to help to forge identity in this Scottish&#x2010;English and, at this time, Dissenter household.

                    <p>For a threat closer to home, one returns to the Catholic Other, even in <date when="1826">1826</date>. The <orgName corresp="#ROMANCATHOLICCHURCH">Catholic</orgName> fear was kept alive in the years running up to the <date when="1829-03-24">Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829</date>, perhaps all the more so in households 
                        like the Ruskins&#x02BC; that had to strain to forge together competing loyalties to form a British identity. In those post&#x2010;<date when="1815-06-18">Waterloo</date> years, <persName corresp="#LC">Colley</persName> points out, 
                        anti&#x2010;Catholic agitation was sustained by &#x201C;an abundance of women&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BRITONS"><hi rend="italic">Britons</hi></ref>, 333).

                        equivocal underhand equally devoid of sincerity or honesty &#x0026; integrity&#x201D; and capable of &#x201C;tak[ing] Satan himself into their cabals to further their purposes

                    <p>Another overdetermining possibility is that the poem also works figuratively to comment on the illness and death of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s
