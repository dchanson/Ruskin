                    <p>The oddly belligerent pacifist message of this poem, combined with its placement alongside poems celebrating both <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> and British pride of manufacture, appears to support <persName corresp="#LC">Linda Colley</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        argument that British identity, <placeName corresp="#NBRITAIN">North</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">South</placeName>, was forged &#x201C;not so much [by] consensus or homogeneity or centralisation at home, as [by] a strong sense of dissimilarity from those without.&#x201D; 
                        Fear of the <orgName corresp="#ROMANCATHOLICCHURCH">Catholic other</orgName> dominated over divisions between <orgName corresp="#CHURCHOFENGLAND">Anglicanism</orgName> and Dissent, and Old and New Dissent, so that Britons defended above all a &#x201C;pluralist yet aggressively Protestant polity&#x201D;; 
                        and recurrent wars with <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>, along with worries about Jacobite restoration, had kept alive the fear &#x201C;that the old popish enemy was still at the gates, more threatening than ever before&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BRITONS">Colley, <hi rend="italic">Britons</hi></ref>, 17, 19, 25, and see p. 18). The 
                        primary function of the fears expressed in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem may well have been to help to forge identity in this Scottish&#x2010;English and, at this time, Dissenter household.
                    </p> 
                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> presumably picked up on these alarms in his parents, each 
                        of whom is likely to have communicated them, perhaps <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> even more so than <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>. As <persName corresp="#LC">Colley</persName> remarks, during the <date notBefore="1789-05-05" notAfter="1799-11-09">Revolutionary</date>
                        and <date notBefore="1799-11-09" notAfter="1815-06-18">Napoleonic</date> Era, &#x201C;many women . . . seem to have believed that their own security and the security of the family unit 
                        were at stake in this <date notBefore="1789-05-05" notAfter="1815-06-18">French war</date> as they had not been in earlier conflicts. In part, this was because the risk of a French invasion of <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> was so much greater in this war than ever before. 
                        But crucial, too, as an ingredient in female anxiety was the destruction of <persName corresp="#MAJ">Marie&#x2010;Antoinette</persName> and the rest of the French Royal Family&#x201D;&#x2014;a regicide that 
                        <persName corresp="#EB">Edmund Burke</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="essay" rend="italic" corresp="#BURKEREFLECTIONS">Reflections on the Revolution in France</title> 
                        (<date when="1790">1790</date>) taught the elder Ruskins&#x02BC; generation to stigmatize specifically in terms &#x201C;of a queen who was also a wife and mother being driven by force from her home&#x201D;
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BRITONS">Colley, <hi rend="italic">Britons</hi></ref>, 254, 253). Hence, 
                        the martial twist given to domestic feeling in this poem is not at all out of keeping with a feminine and domestic emphasis&#x2014;an emphasis that is strong throughout 
                        <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref>, in domestic scenes depicted in <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#HARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</title></ref>, 
                        the most realistic of which center on the children&#x02BC;s interaction with the Mama character, and in the stamp 
                        that <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> herself puts on the manuscript with her <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="mr_gloss_dating_msi_apparatus.php">glosses</ref>.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is far more probable that the poem functions in this way, as a reflector of Britons&#x02BC; self&#x2010;defining fears of the Other, than that it 
                        records an actual threat at the time of its composition. The latest credible threat of invasion of British shores had ended 
                        in <date when="1815">1815</date> with the <date when="1815-06-18">Battle of Waterloo</date>, which closed the <date notBefore="1799-11-09" notAfter="1815-06-18">Napoleonic Wars</date>. 
                        <date when="1815-06-18">Waterloo</date> captured <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s imagination throughout the <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1829">late 1820s</date>, in works such as <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="the_british_battles_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#THEBRITISHBATTLES">&#x201C;The British Battles&#x201D;</title></ref>,

                        Just so, <persName corresp="#CBW">Charlotte</persName> and <persName corresp="#PBB">Branwell</persName> Bront&#x00EB; made <persName corresp="#AWW">Wellington</persName> the hero of their sagas, 
                        but <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s fascination with the <date when="1815-06-18">Battle of Waterloo</date> was not drawn just from books. 
                        A year earlier than compiling the <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">&#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; [MS I Poetry Anthology]</title></ref>, 
                        during the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1825_note.php">Tour of 1825</ref> to the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName>, 
                        the Ruskins visited <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo Field</placeName>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Although composed nine years after <date when="1815-06-18">Waterloo</date>, <title type="poem" corresp="#THEDEFIANCEOFWAR">&#x201C;The Defiance of War&#x201D;</title> was more likely prompted by the <date when="1825">1825</date> 
                        tour along with the national anxieties analyzed by <persName corresp="#LC">Colley</persName> 
                        than to have reflected some more recent conflict. Nonetheless, one cannot discount the possibility that a conflict contemporary with composition of the poem caught the 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s imagination. In <date notBefore="1826-09" notAfter="1826-12">late 1826</date>, 
                        a skirmish occurred in the East, in connection with the <date notBefore="1821-03-06" notAfter="1832-05-07">Greek War for Independence</date> from Turkish domination. 
                        While no threat to <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>, the war would have interested the Ruskins for its associations with 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="byron_note.php"><persName corresp="#GGB">Lord Byron</persName></ref>, who had died in <placeName corresp="#MISSOLONGHI">Missolonghi</placeName> in
                        <date when="1824">1824</date>. In the <date notBefore="1821-03-06" notAfter="1832-05-07">Greek conflict</date>, <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> was striving to avoid an outbreak 
                        between <placeName corresp="#TURKEY">Turkey</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#RUSSIA">Russia</placeName>, whose new tsar, <persName corresp="#TS1">Nicholas I</persName>, was willing
                        to push hostilities. In <date when="1826-10">October 1826</date>, which would accord well with a probable date for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s
                        poem, <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> pressured <placeName corresp="#TURKEY">Turkey</placeName> to accept Russian conditions in the <date when="1826-10-07">Convention of Akkerman</date>. This assured Russian influence in the
                        <geogName corresp="#CAUCASUS">Caucasus</geogName> and the opening of the <geogName corresp="#BOSPHORUSSTRT">Straits of Bosphorus</geogName> to trade, which might have interested the Ruskins&#x02BC; mercantile household.
                        As it turned out, <placeName corresp="#RUSSIA">Russia</placeName> continued to press hostilities in the name of the Greek cause, and <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> joined <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#RUSSIA">Russia</placeName> to declare
                        joint mediation, according to a treaty signed in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> in <date when="1827-07">July 1827</date>, but this event would certainly have
                        occurred too late to have occasioned <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem. (In the subsequent history, the Turks refused mediation but were defeated by
                        allied fleets at <placeName corresp="#NAVARINO">Navarino</placeName> in <date when="1827-10">October 1827</date>. The <date when="1829-09-14">Treaty of Adrianople</date>, rendering <placeName corresp="#GREECE">Greece</placeName> autonomous, was signed
                        two years later, in <date when="1829-09">September 1829</date>.)</p>
                    <p>For a threat closer to home, one returns to the Catholic Other, even in <date when="1826">1826</date>. The <orgName corresp="#ROMANCATHOLICCHURCH">Catholic</orgName> fear was kept alive in the years running up to the <date when="1829-03-24">Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829</date>, perhaps all the more so in households 
                        like the Ruskins&#x02BC; that had to strain to forge together competing loyalties to form a British identity. In those post&#x2010;<date when="1815-06-18">Waterloo</date> years, <persName corresp="#LC">Colley</persName> points out, 
                        anti&#x2010;Catholic agitation was sustained by &#x201C;an abundance of women&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BRITONS"><hi rend="italic">Britons</hi></ref>, 333). 
                        In <date when="1829-02">February 1829</date>, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>, observing the advance of <date when="1829-03-24">Catholic Emancipation</date>, would be moved to put aside her suburban calm and flash out against &#x201C;the R Catholics and their favourers&#x201D; as &#x201C;weak 
                        equivocal underhand equally devoid of sincerity or honesty &#x0026; integrity&#x201D; and capable of &#x201C;tak[ing] Satan himself into their cabals to further their purposes 
                        to bring every thing under their subjection&#x201D; (<title type="letter" corresp="mr_to_jjr_1829-02-14">letter of <date when="1829-02-14">14 February 1829</date></title> [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 177]).</p>
                    <p>Another overdetermining possibility is that the poem also works figuratively to comment on the illness and death of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s
                        cousin, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_james_note.php"><persName corresp="#JRPSON">James Richardson</persName></ref> (see

                        grief for his <persName corresp="#JRPSON">cousin</persName> might have mixed with alarm over the threat that disease posed to the peace of the household. As an intriguing clue, 
                        <persName corresp="#CWB">Charles W. Borchers, IV</persName> has discovered beneath the title an erased word that appears to be <hi rend="italic">woe</hi>.</p>
