                        &#x201C;heights of wisdom&#x201D; down the ravine between narrowing mountain heights until the word &#x201C;last&#x201D; declares the bottom. 
                        Below that are found &#x201C;depths of folly&#x201D; and &#x201C;rivulet of vice&#x201D;.

                        <p>The emblematic drawing was perhaps inspired by a passage in <title type="lesson" corresp="#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><hi rend="italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</hi></title> (<date when="1825">1825</date>) by <persName corresp="#ME">Maria Edgeworth</persName>: 
                            Only &#x201c;those who are themselves children, or . . . those who know children right well&#x201d; will credit 
                            <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName>&#x02bc;s &#x201c;sudden falls from the heights of wisdom to the depths of folly&#x201d;. The protagonists 
                            have been engaged in well&#x2010;regulated learning: <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> has been teaching <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> the mechanics of air pumps, 
                            using a pump made of glass in order to exhibit its inner workings. &#x201c;How did <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> spend 
                            the remainder of this morning, two whole hours?&#x201d; the narrator asks. They spoil the glass pump by 
                            setting it to work in a muddy puddle, and they soil their clothing so badly that they are forced 
                            to hide in a tree to avoid their <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MAMMAME">mother</persName>&#x02bc;s summons to greet unexpected visitors. To their consternation, 
                            their shame and bashfulness cost them an interesting account of a shipwreck, which the visitors related. 
                            <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> beg their <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MAMMAME">mother</persName> to repeat the story, but she refuses lest they lose this motivation to overcome 
                            their follies of bashfulness and carelessness with their things.  
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><title type="lesson" corresp="#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><hi rend="italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</hi></title></ref>1:103, and see 103&#x2013;14).</p>
                        
                        <p>Assuming that the source is correctly identified, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> can be seen translating an example of Edgeworthian experiential learning 
                            into the kind of didactic discourse that the Edgeworths opposed&#x2014;teaching a child by lecture or emblem instead of allowing children to arrive at wisdom for themselves 
                            through their own experience. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s emblematic picture dispenses with narrative details&#x2014;experience&#x2014;in order to distill a pictorial contrast of &#x201c;heights of wisdom&#x201d; and 
                            &#x201c;depths of folly&#x201d;. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s edition of <title type="lesson" corresp="#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><hi rend="italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</hi></title> was not illustrated (see 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="boyhood_books_note.php#DESCRIPTIONS">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Physical Descriptions</ref>), 
                            and the Edgeworths would not have approved of illustration in the form of allegory. In other books owned by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, however, 
                            emblems were familiar, such as <title type="anthology" corresp="#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALES"><hi rend="italic">Christmas Tales</hi></title> by 
                            <persName type="fictional" corresp="#SOBERSIDES">Solomon Sobersides</persName>. Its frontispiece represents Wisdom and Folly competing to lead the steps of youth, 
                            as explained by an accompanying text: &#x201c;See here the Youth, by Wisdom led, / The Paths of Life, securely tread; / The dang&#x02bc;rous Lures of Folly shun, / 
                            And Virtue&#x02bc;s Course serenely run.&#x201d;</p>
                        
                        <p>The emblems in this woodcut are unpacked in an essay introducing the copy of 
                            <title type="anthology" corresp="#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALES"><hi rend="italic">Christmas Tales</hi></title> held by the <orgName corresp="#HOCKLIFFE">Hockliffe Collection</orgName>: 
                            &#x201c;A masterpiece of its kind&#x201d;, the engraving shows &#x201c;Wisdom (looking rather like Britannia) giving a book to a young boy, 
                            while Folly (distinguished by her fool&#x02bc;s hat) tries to distract him with a rattle. Behind them, we see the solid and magnificent temple 
                            built by Wisdom, and the ruined temple which must be the result of heeding the &#x2018;Lures of Folly&#x2019;&#x201d;

                            The emblems in the frontispiece are derived from traditional sources, such as those found in <persName corresp="#CRIPA">Cesare Ripa</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="book" corresp="#RIPAICONOLOGIA"><hi rend="italic">Iconologia</hi></title>, 
                            but they have been adapted to a child&#x02bc;s text. The youth is put in the place of the classical hero, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HERCULES">Hercules</persName>, 
                            who according to a parable must choose between virtue and vice. An example of an adaptation in neoclassical art is

                            by <persName corresp="#PGBATONI">Pompeo Girolamo Batoni</persName>, in which <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HERCULES">Hercules</persName> weighs the alternatives offered on the one hand by <persName type="fictional" corresp="#VENUS">Venus</persName> and on the other 
                            by the armored figure of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MINERVA">Minerva</persName>, who points to the <placeName type="fictional" corresp="#TEMPLEOFFAME">Temple of Fame</placeName> on a hill. In one of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s favorite boyhood books, 
                            <title type="lesson" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title>, he would have encountered a version adapted for girls,
