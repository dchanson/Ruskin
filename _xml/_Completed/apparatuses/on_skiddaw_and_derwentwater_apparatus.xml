                        <head type="subsection">Composition</head>
                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> composed the poem in blank verse, except for the final ten lines, which he headed &#x201C;conclusion&#x201D; in draft, 
                            and which he formed as rhymed octosyllabic couplets, perhaps influenced by <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>. 
                            Structurally, the rough draft works by simple accretion, one section or strophe being added to the next using explicit transitions, such as 
                            &#x201C;Ive treated of the clouds. now <geogName corresp="#SKIDDAW">skiddaw</geogName> come&#x201D; and &#x201C;Now <geogName corresp="#DERWENTWATER">derwent water</geogName> come&#x201D;. 
                            Writing the poem in stages, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> changed from pencil to pen, and from one color of ink to another. 
                            Twice he interrupted composition of the poem with other texts. Given this structure of built&#x2010;up units over time, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> treated the draft as both expandable and contractible&#x2014;the 
                            contraction evident in a deleted ninth line, which could have triggered a premature ending, &#x201C;Now hear my boyish moral&#x201D;. 
                            Yet the poem&#x02BC;s title suggests that, from the start, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> projected his compound topic of mountain and lake; 
                            no evidence suggests that he decided seriatim to write first about <geogName corresp="#SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</geogName> and then to add a strophe 
                            about <geogName corresp="#DERWENTWATER">Derwent Water</geogName>. The title containing the two place names shows no cramping on the page, 
                            as if he added the phrase &#x201C;&#x0026; lake derwent&#x201D; as an afterthought. Overall, the poem represents a sustained and sophisticated effort, 
                            an advance in realized poetic ambition beyond anything <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had both attempted and completed previously; and although its composition worked 
                            by accretion, compiling conventional picturesque tropes, the poem convinces as a whole.</p>
                        
                        <p>In the progress of drafting the poem in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> interrupts

                            twice by pausing to insert fragments of other texts, which form no part of the topographical poem. As explained in <ref type="internal" target="#DATE">Date</ref>, 
                            the positions and content of these intervening texts help to date <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s progress on the draft, and they also provide clues about the poem&#x02BC;s social context, composition, 
                            and eventual presentation as a birthday gift for <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>.</p>

                                but a cover letter accompanying &#x201C;Birthday Odes &#x007C; To my dear Papa&#x201D;, including a presentation copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATERMSV">&#x201C;On <geogName corresp="#SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</geogName> and <geogName corresp="#DERWENTWATER">Derwent Water</geogName>&#x201D;</title>). 
                            As described here by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, this stage of the poem&#x02BC;s development accords well with the first strophe

                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> &#x201C;found that when . . . [the line] was missed the poem sounded quite well without it&#x201D;. 
                                Falling at the end of <geogName corresp="#SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</geogName> strophe, and immediately preceding the <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> sermon material, the line could simply be lopped off in recitation

                        <p>From this evidence, one can deduce that composition of the <geogName corresp="#DERWENTWATER">Derwent</geogName> strophe would probably have been contemporaneous 
                            with <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s presence in the household&#x2014;now not as a distantly admired clergyman, 
                            but as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s personal tutor with an interest in the youth&#x02BC;s writing. 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s recitation of the unfinished poem to his father, with its evasive maneuveur, 
                            must have occurred sometime in the <date when="1829-04">last week of March or in April 1829</date>, 
                            when a gap in the surviving family letters indicates that <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> had returned home from traveling for wine orders. 
                            <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> was engaged as a tutor starting early in <date when="1829-04">April</date> 
                            (see <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="andrews_edward_note.php"><persName corresp="#EA">Edward Andrews [1787&#x2013;1841]</persName></ref>). 
                            Since <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1829-05-10">10 May</date> birthday was fast approaching, 
                            and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had yet to complete composition and fair&#x2010;copying of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATERMSV">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D;</title>, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have been encouraged to recite his poem to his tutor, as well. <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            influence&#x2014;whether conveyed directly by the tutor as suggestions, or indirectly through his Latin instruction&#x2014;is evident in the poem&#x02BC;s second strophe, 
                            which introduces allusions to <persName corresp="#HOMER">Homer</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#ODYSSEY"><hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi></title>.</p>
                            
                            <p>In the poem&#x02BC;s classical allusions, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have been responding not only to his tutor&#x02BC;s learning but also to his teaching style.

                            which he drafted in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title>. <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> amused <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                                by &#x201C;comparing <persName type="fictional" corresp="#NEPTUNE">Neptune</persName>s lifting up the wrecked ships of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#AENEAS">eenaes</persName> 
                                with his trident to my lifting up a potatoe with a fork or taking a piece of bread out of a bowl of milk&#x201D;. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own classical analogies in his poem 
                                are not so whimsical, but they attribute playfulness to the landscape itself by comparing <geogName corresp="#DERWENTWATER">Lake Derwent</geogName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;polished surface&#x201D; 
                                to the &#x201C;fair and oft deceiving&#x201D; <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PENELOPE">Penelope</persName>, since reflections are woven on the lake&#x02BC;s surface, but unwoven 
                                when the placid surface is ruffled by &#x201C;bluff&#x201D; <persName type="fictional" corresp="#AEOLUS">Aeolus</persName>. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> compares this deceptive 
                                &#x201C;polished surface&#x201D; to &#x201C;a boy at play / who labours at the snow to make a man / And when he&#x02BC;s made it&#x201D;, 
                                <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PENELOPE">Penelope</persName>&#x2010;like he &#x201C;knocks it down again&#x201D;. 
                                Comparison making is in itself a form of play, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> recognizes: 
                                &#x201C;So when thou&#x02BC;st made a picture thou dost play / At tearing it to pieces&#x201D;.</p>
                       
                        <p>Beyond the composition of the poem, <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s influence may also have extended to the form in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> presented a fair copy of the poem to his father on his birthday (see

                            Without question, what the poem became through revision and publication was influenced by the character of <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s magazine, the <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title>, 
                            which started publication in <date when="1829-05">May 1829</date>, the month of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s birthday (see <ref type="internal" target="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</ref>).</p>

                                He changes the register of the poem, however, from the playfulness of the picturesque to the solemnity of the sublime; 
                                he moves the first&#x2010;person pronoun from an agency of invention (&#x201C;enough / Ive treated of the clouds. now <geogName corresp="#SKIDDAW">skiddaw</geogName> come&#x201D;) 
                                to a figure in the landscape (&#x201C;there would I like to wander&#x201D;); and he abandons blank verse for rhymed octosyllabic couplets&#x2014;<persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                                verse form for their narrative poems. These dramatic changes, combined with the emphatic labeling of the closing lines as a &#x201C;conclusion&#x201D;, 
                                suggest that composition of this poem was caught up along with some other works in a family debate over <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s tendency to leave his writing unfinished.</p>

                                to an otherwise playful and confiding letter, declaring that he would have written a more &#x201C;serious letter&#x201D; but was confident that

                            However, since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> inscribed this letter as &#x201C;Birthday Odes&#x201D;&#x2014;using the plural&#x2014;the presentation copy evidently was not devoted solely to the

                                It is possible that this pamphlet constituted the &#x201C;Birthday Odes&#x201D; that accompanied

                                along with the topographical poem, several other poems and a play, including the <date when="1829">1829</date> birthday ode,

                            <p>Some evidence for this scenario of the birthday presentation is supported by the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title> draft, <title corresp="#JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATERMSII">&#x201C;description of <geogName corresp="#SKIDDAW">skiddaw</geogName> &#x0026; <geogName corresp="#DERWENTWATER">lake derwent</geogName>&#x201D;</title>, 
                                which wraps around draft of another work&#x2014;the first of the two unrelated texts that interrupt the composition of <title corresp="#JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATERMSII">&#x201C;description&#x201D;</title>&#x2014;a fragmentary text 
                                consisting of the word <ref type="witness" target="play_msii.php">&#x201C;Play&#x201D;</ref> followed by a few lines. 
                                This may be the earliest witness of <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="battle_of_waterloo_a_play_msv_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Battle of <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName>: A Play in Two Acts&#x201D;</ref>. 
                                Moreover, the handmade physical pamphlet containing the fair copies matches the size of the handmade <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title>, 10 by 16 cm. 
                                Since these are the dimensions of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title></ref>, the 
                                <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="battle_of_waterloo_ms_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#BATTLEOFWATERLOOMS">&#x201C;Battle of <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName>&#x201D;</title></ref> pamphlet 
                                suggests an added "volume" to &#x201C;his works as he calls them&#x201D;, in <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s phrase of <date when="1829-03">March 1829</date>. The  
                                pamphlet even sported a pink or red cover. As a birthday gift to his father, the pamphlet would have posed an ambitiously positive response 
                                to his parents&#x02BC; demand that he finish his works.</p>
                            
                            <p>Convergent with this evidence is the striking coincidence that the first number of <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s magazine, 
                                <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title>, was published in <date when="1829-05">May 1829</date>, the month of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s birthday. 
                                A portion of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem would not be published until the <date when="1829-08">August</date> number; however, the idea of a <hi rend="italic">magazine</hi> as a miscellany 
                                may have influenced <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s collection of a drama with other poems. <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s own children produced a handmade magazine for their household (see 
                                <ref type="internal" target="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</ref>; see also <ref type="internal" target="#PUBLICATION">Revision and First Publication</ref>).</p>
                        
                        <p>Despite all this, one cannot entirely discount the possibility that the pamphlet was a project separate from <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s birthday presentation, 
                            and produced later in <date notBefore="1829-05-10" notAfter="1829-12-31">1829, after 10 May</date>. In that case, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s

                            a different fair&#x2010;copy version of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATERMSV">&#x201C;On <geogName corresp="#SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</geogName> and <geogName corresp="#DERWENTWATER">Derwent Water</geogName>&#x201D;</title> 
                            than the one included in the pamphlet&#x2014;one which perhaps 
                            was paired solely with the birthday ode, <title type="poem" corresp="#MAY">&#x201C;May&#x201D;</title>, and no other work.</p>

                            Thus, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s first poem to appear in print, and his first publication of any kind, was

                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s second publication was

                            which similarly was signed &#x201C;<persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">R.</persName>&#x201D;, and which appeared in the <date when="1830-02">February 1830</date> (vol. 1, no. 10) issue. 
                            The responsibility and authority for the splitting and revision of the poem are unknown. As the editors of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> speculate, 
                            the revision presumably was guided either by the magazine&#x02BC;s editor,

                            Scholars have weighted the responsibility on the father&#x02BC;s side 
                            (see, e.g., <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MAIDMENTONLYPRINT"><persName corresp="#BEM">Maidment</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#MAIDMENTONLYPRINT">&#x201C;&#x2018;Only Print&#x2019;&#x201D;</title></ref>, 196), 
                            but <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s influence may have been taken too much for granted. As shown in <ref type="internal" target="#COMPOSITIONANDANDREWS">Composition: The Influence of <persName corresp="#EA">Edward Andrews</persName></ref>, 
                            <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s mythology lessons are perceptible even in the draft.</p>

                        <p>The available evidence of another hand besides <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s in the compositional process is slight. At lines 23&#x2013;24  
                            (&#x201C;Lower than <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> or <geogName corresp="#ANDES">Andes</geogName>&#x201D; [<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title>]), 
                            the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title> draft shows a substitution of &#x201C;For less&#x201D; in place of &#x201C;lower&#x201D;, which was written in a different medium than the underlying text, 
                            and which appears to be in the hand of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>. The substitution was not used in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> fair copy, 
                            so one may infer that the change represents a stage of revision following <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s presentation of the poem for his father&#x02BC;s birthday. 
                            The published version does show an alteration from the fair&#x2010;copy text at this point, but not quite the same substitution 
                            (&#x201C;Though less than <geogName corresp="#ANDES">Andes</geogName>, or the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alpine</geogName> heights&#x201D;).</p>

                            Isolating these concluding lines for publication was easy, since they were already set apart from the main body of the poem by their octosyllabic couplets and their sublime rather than picturesque mode 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPOSITIONANDCONCLUSION">Composition of the &#x201C;Conclusion&#x201D; and Parental Demands for Completion</ref>). 
                            Revision of just ten lines was possible between the <date when="1829-05">May presentation</date> to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> and the <date when="1829-08">August</date> publication date, 
                            whereas revision of the main body of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s original poem apparently required the later publication date of <date when="1830-02">February 1830</date>.</p>
                        
                        <p>There was time enough, nonetheless, for the ten&#x2010;line conclusion to undergo several minor revisions and one major development to arrive at

                            The major change transfers the reflection of lightning over <geogName corresp="#HELVELLYN">Mount Helvellyn</geogName> from the outer surface of a &#x201C;mountain rill&#x201D; 
                            to an internalized play &#x201C;oe&#x02BC;r the Poet&#x02BC;s eye&#x201D; and warming of his &#x201C;heart&#x201D;. In a brief space, 
                            the aesthetic paradigm shifts from mirror to lamp, imitation to expression. Yet the Romantic paradigm is instantly quelled by the addition 
                            of a moralizing couplet, raising the total number of lines from ten to twelve, which deprives the Poet of solace in nature: 
                            &#x201C;Though such thy glories Earth, thy proudest whole, / Can never satiate the grasping soul!&#x201D; Similarly, when the remainder of the poem was revised for publication

                            It is unclear how <persName corresp="#HRN">Nicoll</persName> arrived at this conclusion, since he had no access to the manuscript versions, draft or fair copy, lacking the couplet. Perhaps, 
                            since he gained access to a rare set of the journal issues with the assistance of the Andrews family, they made him privy to family stories 
                            about the <persName corresp="#EA">Reverend Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s part in revising <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem (see <ref type="internal" target="#REDISCOVERY">The Rediscovery of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s First Publication</ref>). 
                            More likely, <persName corresp="#HRN">Nicoll</persName> compared the <title type="poem" corresp="#JRLINESCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines&#x201D;</title> as published in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title>

                            this text ends with <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s original conclusion, lacking the two lines found only in <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title>. 
                            Noticing the shift in tone, <persName corresp="#HRN">Nicoll</persName> may have decided that the additional couplet can only have been the work of a clergyman rather than of a ten&#x2010;year&#x2010;old 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="SUBSEQUENTPUBLICATION1891">Editing for Publication in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [<date when="1891">1891</date>]</title></ref>).</p>
                        
                        <p>At the same time, the revised version for the <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title> intensifies the original&#x02BC;s theme 
                            of playfulness. In lines 12&#x2013;16 of the revision, the original&#x02BC;s description of &#x201C;straggler&#x201D; roots is caught up in a simile about the rambunctious play of an &#x201C;urchin boy&#x201D;, 
                            whose foot tramples and &#x201C;dissolves&#x201D; the root&#x2010;bound &#x201C;mould&#x201D;, just as the dissolving shapes in the clouds chase away one anoother. The added simile parallels <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own original simile 
                            of a &#x201C;boy at play / who labours at the snow to make a man / And when he&#x02BC;s made it knocks it down again&#x201D;. As <persName corresp="#HRN">Nicoll</persName> concluded from his study of the magazine, 
                            <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> did not intend <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title> to be conventionally religious, and yet it is in fact 
                            conventional in its piety, if unexpectedly varied in content (see <ref type="internal" target="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</ref>). Just so, <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> 
                            seems to have been capable equally of pairing <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s snowman maker with a playmate in the urchin boy 
                            and of dampening that playfulness with a cautionary couplet.</p>

                            While it seems surprising that the admiring father could have forgotten <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s very first appearance in print, 
                            <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> was interested in preserving only the &#x201C;best&#x201D; 
                            of his son&#x02BC;s early publications in the collected volume&#x2014;and for him, the &#x201C;best&#x201D; seems by definition to have precluded early, much less first, publications. 
                            He also rejected reprinting of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s first high&#x2010;profile verse publication, the poem <ref type="apparatus" target="saltzburg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title></ref>

                            In contrast, a fascination with what were called &#x201C;firsts&#x201D; or &#x201C;early editions&#x201D; by modern authors

                                    <p>I have before me a volume containing ten numbers, all that were published, of the <hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi>. It was commenced in <date when="1829-05">May, 1829</date>, 
                                        and was published by Mr. D. Freeman, of 52, Paternoster Row, <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, and 8, Keene&#x02BC;s Row, <placeName corresp="#WALWORTH">Walworth</placeName>. The editor was the <persName corresp="#EA">Rev. Dr. Andrews</persName>, 
                                        minister of <placeName type="building" corresp="#BERESFORDCHAPEL">Beresford Chapel</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#WALWORTH">Walworth</placeName>, one of the most distinguished dissenting ministers of his time. In the first number <placeName corresp="#EA">Dr. Andrews</placeName> suggests 
                                        that the composition of his magazine is to be &#x201C;sprightly and elegant&#x201D;, that it is to &#x201C;break out of the trammels in which other religious periodicals 
                                        seem proud to confine themselves, and show that even piety may be connected with high talent, and that vulgarity of style is not inseperable with what are foolishly called 
                                        high doctrines, and dullness from what more sober persons call Evangelical&#x201D;. The magazine is, however, for the most part, explicitly and fervently religious. 
                                        <persName corresp="#EA">Dr. Andrews</persName> contributes some articles on his personal experiences as a minister, including a curious account of his visits to <persName corresp="#EHHM">Edward H. H. Martelly</persName>,

                                        being unable to find an appropriate conclusion. They are as follows:&#x2014;[<persName corresp="#HRN">Nicoll</persName>&#x02BC;s transcription,

                            incidentally, where they obtained a copy of the magazine) did not view <persName corresp="#HRN">Nicoll</persName>&#x02BC;s transcription&#x2014;or, 
                            if they did see it, did not allow themselves to be guided by its choices. As described in the textual notes to the <title type="periodical" corresp="#BOOKMAN"><hi rend="italic">Bookman</hi></title> transcription, 
                            it contains (along with some minor alterations in punctuation) at least two significant departures from the <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title> text, 
                            which do not appear in the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> transcription. If <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName>

                            on their division of the poem into two stanzas, following <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s division of the text, not the undivided copytext;

                            which is supported only by <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s text, not the copytext). At least some of these preferences for <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s editing 
                            over the copytext at hand seem deliberate, whereas there is no evidence that <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> 
                            even accidentally transmitted unique features in <persName corresp="#HRN">Nicoll</persName>&#x02BC;s transcription. (At the same time, it must be admitted that 
                            <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> also may have silently rejected some of <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s

                    <p>Biographically, perhaps the most significant influence on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s composition of his poem was a journey that definitely

                        destined for the <placeName corresp="LAKEDISTRICT">Lakes</placeName>; however, they cut the trip short when they had gotten only so far as <placeName corresp="#CORNWALL">Cornwall</placeName>, 
                        where they received news of the death of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s sister,

                        Looking forward, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> could have relied on an engraving of the scene in his poem to supply the place of memory.

                        but its point may have been to dispel memories of grief with future hope rather than with alternative memories of past pleasures. (For another topographical poem that may have been engaged with grief therapeutically, see

                        As remarked above (<ref type="internal" target="#COMPOSITIONANDANDREWS">The Influence of <persName corresp="#EA">Edward Andrews</persName> on Initial Composition</ref>),

                        just so, the secular pleasantry of a picturesque poem was not out of place in <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s new periodical, 
                        which the editor&#x2010;clergyman promised would &#x201C;break out of the trammels in which other religious periodicals seem proud to confine themselves, 
                        and show that even piety may be connected with high talent, and that vulgarity of style is not inseperable with what are foolishly called high doctrines&#x201D;

                        <p>The mission of <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s magazine to &#x201C;break out of the trammels&#x201D; of sectarianism was not unique. The much longer&#x2010;lived Congregational magazine,

                            and the supposed incompatibility of evangelical seriousness with a broad cultivation of literature and taste. In the <title type="periodical" corresp="#ECLECTICREVIEW"><hi rend="italic">Eclectic</hi></title>&#x02BC;s 
                            first years, regular contributors included the essayist, <persName corresp="#JFOSTER">John Foster</persName> (<date notBefore="1770" notAfter="1843">1770&#x2013;1843</date>), and the poet,

                            was committed to bridging the gap between Dissent and Establishment

                            On a broader scale, <persName corresp="#DSCRITIC">David Stewart</persName> has proposed that Romantic&#x2010;era magazines in general resisted becoming trapped in bunkered positions as culture fissured into 
                            competing disciplines and positions; instead, magazines sought a heterogeneous audience who in turn positioned itself in relation to a magazine culture and not just a single organ of opinion

                            The editors of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#ECLECTICREVIEW"><hi rend="italic">Eclectic Review</hi></title> discovered, however, that an &#x201C;eclectic&#x201D; stance was difficult to maintain, 
                            and found themselves driven to promoting more decisively Nonconformist interests of civic and religious liberty in the turbulent period of reform.</p>
                        
                        <p>Likewise, another heterogeneous periodical, the <title type="periodical" corresp="#PATRIOT"><hi rend="italic">Patriot</hi></title> (<date notBefore="1832" notAfter="1866">1832&#x2013;66</date>), 
                            which was operated jointly by interests of <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalists</orgName> and <orgName corresp="#BAPTISM">Baptists</orgName>, 
                            struggled to build adequate support on a nationwide subscriber base of Dissenters who upheld loyalty to voluntaryism on the question of Church Establishment, 
                            but who shrank from identifying with radical Dissent. The newspaper&#x02BC;s trustees turned to the experienced journalist, <persName corresp="#JCEDITOR">Josiah Conder</persName> (<date notBefore="1789" notAfter="1855">1789&#x2013;1855</date>), 
                            already editor of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#ECLECTICREVIEW"><hi rend="italic">Eclectic Review</hi></title>, to increase subscription, 
                            but the <title type="periodical" corresp="#PATRIOT"><hi rend="italic">Patriot</hi></title> nonetheless almost foundered along with its editor 
                            because <persName corresp="#JCEDITOR">Conder</persName> was perceived as too soft on the question of Establishment even in the view of moderates, 
                            much less of the radical voluntaryists (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#COOPERPATRIOT"><persName corresp="#JNCOOPER">Cooper</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#COOPERPATRIOT">&#x201C;Dissenters and National Journalism&#x201D;</title></ref>). 
                            Given that the weekly <title type="periodical" corresp="#PATRIOT"><hi rend="italic">Patriot</hi></title> and monthly <title type="periodical" corresp="#ECLECTICREVIEW"><hi rend="italic">Eclectic</hi></title> 
                            survived only by virtue of deft political and theological positioning, not to mention the hugely energetic labors of professional journalists like <persName corresp="#JCEDITOR">Conder</persName>, 
                            no wonder that the modest <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title> failed to summon adequate support. In the magazine&#x02BC;s final 
                            issue, <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> attributed the failure to an unspecified &#x201C;want of encouragement&#x201D; (see <ref type="internal" target="#REDISCOVERY">The Rediscovery of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s First Publication</ref>). Add to this 
                            the scale of the competition, with four thousand journal titles estimated to have been founded in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>

                        <p>Compared to these national political struggles, the conflicts staged in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title> 
                            are domestic in scale. In dueling correspondence on the &#x201C;Religious Education of Children&#x201D; contributed by &#x201C;Rector&#x201D; and &#x201C;Cor&#x2010;Rector&#x201D;, the former observes that 
                            &#x201C;children of ministers turn out worse than others&#x201D; for &#x201C;when they do get into the world, they riot in it&#x201D;. Having been &#x201C;made to sit through a long form of worship before they can understand one word&#x201D;, 
                            their overloaded &#x201C;brains are turned&#x201D;; and &#x201C;growing older, and their wishes and desires expanding&#x201D;, they remain dangerously thwarted, &#x201C;not allowed to read anything 
                            in a dramatic form,&#x2014;good or bad,&#x2014;nay&#x201D; not even &#x201C;any thing fictitious&#x201D;. Cor&#x2010;Rector replies with an anecdote about a godly child who read Scripture from infancy, 
                            soon growing so fond of it that he became a prodigy. &#x201C;As he grew older, and his desires expanding, what on earth could anything in a dramatic form benefit his mind, or the reading of any fictitious books? . . . 
                            Would not this supplant all the preceding labours bestowed on the child, and fill the library of his mind with gross fictions, and subverting from his heart in future days the fear of God, which was the beginning of his wisdom? . . . 
                            Hymn learning and hymn singing is charming, and more than refreshing from infants&#x201D;. Rector considers such prodigies to be hypocrites. The argument goes nowhere, partly because the magazine stopped publication, 
                            but also because, despite the promise of the magazine to favor the &#x201C;sprightly and elegant&#x201D;, the editor declined from the start to speak courageously in favor of broad&#x2010;minded cultivation: 
                            according to the &#x201C;Observations by the Editor&#x201D; appended to Rector&#x02BC;s initial letter, &#x201C;We insert the above letter because, in the main its assertions are just: 
                            but we think it dangerous to say any thing that might be mistaken as unfriendly to catechisms, 
                            and the learning of hymns, &#x0026;c.; all of which, if not overdone, may be unspeakably useful&#x201D;

                                which are akin to the topic of worldliness versus anti&#x2010;worldliness, but which may or may not be related to the revision of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem for publication, and may or may not even be meant as poetry. 
                                The fragments appear to record a debate over the respective claims of worldly beauty and religious austerity.</p>

                                The debate&#x2014;if debate it is&#x2014;seems to culminate in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title> with another fragment,

                                which is an almost illegible, scrawled draft. These fragments may bear witness to the revision process, seeking the new concluding couplet for 
                                <title type="poem" corresp="#JRLINESCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines&#x201D;</title>, which would be published in <date when="1829-08">August 1829</date>&#x2014;or, less likely given the lapse of time, they may relate to the new conclusion to the <date when="1830-02">February 1830</date>

                                    The fragments may not be poetry at all, but an attempt to transcribe a sermon. Whatever their origin, the fragments attest to the awareness of a tension between the secular picturesque and the religious sublime in the household during the period of composing and revising <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem (see

                        In its first issue, the journal announced itself as a &#x201C;sprightly and elegant&#x201D; production that would &#x201C;break out of the trammels in which other religious 
                        periodicals seem proud to confine themselves, and show that even piety may be connected with high talent, and that vulgarity of style is not inseparable 
                        with what are foolishly called high doctrines, and dulness from what more sober persons call Evangelical&#x201D; (quoted in

                        The tone matches what <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> remarked as <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s signature &#x201C;expressions&#x201D; of 
                        &#x201C;almost but not quite&#x201D; and of appearing &#x201C;best when he frowns next when he laughs and next when he neither frowns nor laughs.&#x201D; 
                        The characterization suggests the phenomenon of miscellaneity that <persName corresp="#DSCRITIC">David Stewart</persName> has remarked in the 
                        <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> magazine culture of the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, 
                        as a conviction of knowledge as &#x201C;contained within a single intellectual structure&#x201D; was relinquished for an idea of knowledge as 
                        &#x201C;divided between a large number of distinct divisions&#x201D;

                        It is possible that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intended the handmade pamphlet, <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title></ref>, 
                        to reflect this eclectic magazine culture, combining, as it does, poems and sermons, an Edgeworthian lesson and a religious piece entitled "a theme", a start on a play, 
                        and letters to family and friends as if corresponding with a subscribership.</p> 
                    
                    <p>The ephemerality of <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s journal may account for the relative unimportance that the Ruskins appear to have attached to 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s first publication. Yet, while the Ruskins would seek loftier venues for <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        subsequent boyhood publications, a feature of this first effort persisted in the family&#x02BC;s tendency to gravitate to publishers with whom they could establish 
                        a personal connection such as a shared Scottish heritage. In about four years, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s two poems in the 
                        <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title> would be almost forgotten, dimmed by the splendor surrounding the appearance of his poems,

                        and the contribution of his prose piece, <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="enquiries_on_the_causes_of_the_colour_of_the_water_of_the_rhine_apparatus.php"><title type="essay" corresp="#JRENQUIRIES">&#x201C;Enquiries on the Causes of the Colour of the Water of the Rhine&#x201D;</title></ref>,

                        Nonetheless, leading up to these publications, the Ruskins sought the mentorship of men of letters who, while more celebrated than <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>, 
                        had like him visited the Ruskins&#x02BC; suburban home, <placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName>&#x2014;the poet and editor,

                        <persName corresp="#AE">Alexander Elder</persName> (1790&#x2013;1876). All were Scotsmen; and <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName>&#x02BC;s publishing firm, 
                        <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>, even employed <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cousin,

                        also personal acquaintances would help to shape the literary persona known as <persName type="pen_name">&#x201C;J.R.&#x201D;</persName>, which had already gotten his start as 
                        <persName type="pen_name">&#x201C;R.&#x201D;</persName> in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title>.</p> 
                    <p>In <date when="1829">1829</date>, not only could the Ruskins claim personal connections with <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>, but the 
                        <placeName corresp="#WALWORTH">Walworth</placeName> preacher could impress them with his own share of fame.  
                        &#x201C;What a nice face he has,&#x201C; commented the young <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName>. Yet, unlike the distinguished Scotsmen who ushered

                        <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> fell from grace. Perhaps the main discouragement to giving <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s first 
                        publication its full due was the pronouncement by the elder Ruskins in <date when="1831">1831</date> that, while &#x201C;the Dr. has wonderful talents . . . 
                        he is certainly fighty&#x201D; and on his way to compromising &#x201C;his respectability and fortune and prevent[ing] his filling that place in society his talents entitle him to&#x201D;

                        It must have seemed intolerable that the literary birth of <persName type="pen_name">&#x201C;J.R.&#x201D;</persName> could have been attended by anything less than 
                        the most solid assurances of success, much less the want of respectability.</p>
                    
                    <p>While Ruskin's anxiety to conclude, which was imposed by his parents, extended to his other works in progress, 
                        the enchantment with Scott was shared by the entire family at this time, as in February Margaret had "begun Quentin Durward 
                        with which the children are much pleased" (RFL 176). The family was engaged with Scott's novel about the centralizing of the French monarchy 
                        in the fifteenth century while, in Britain in 1829, the debate over the Catholic Emancipation bill was reaching a crisis 
                        (Margaret opined that "the R Catholics and their favourers . . . would take Satan himself into their cabals to further their purposes to bring every thing under 
                        their subjection" [RFL 177]). At the same time, Ruskin wrestled to bring order to his Lake District poem revived his engagement with Scott's novels, The Monastery and The Abbot, treating of the clash between
