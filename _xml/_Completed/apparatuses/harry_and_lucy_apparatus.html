                     <h4><span class="headingNumber">1.5.1.1. </span><span class="head">Volume 1</span></h4>
                     <p><span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span> dated <a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS I</span></a> as having been “begun about <span class="date">Sep<sup>t</sup> or Oct 1826</span>” and as having been “finished about <span class="date">Jan<sup>y</sup> 1827</span>”. Since she inserted this notation within <a class="link_ref" href="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php">“Poetry” [MS I Poetry Anthology]</a> toward the end of the manuscript, it seems likely that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> had devoted the latter part of this period—perhaps, <span class="date">December through January</span>—to fair‐copying and/or composing the poetry anthology, while he had spent <span class="date">the fall of 1826</span> on <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span> (see also <a class="link_ref" href="the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php#DATE"><span class="titlem">“The Needless Alarm”</span>: Date</a>; <a class="link_ref" href="on_papas_leaving_home_apparatus.php#DATE"><span class="titlem">“On Papaʼs Leaving Home”</span>: Date;</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php#DATE"><span class="titlem">MS I</span>: Date</a>). It is also possible that, as suggested by a change in narrative style midway in
                        the text of <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> may have drafted the opening portion at an earlier period (see <a class="link_ref" href="#SOURCES" title="Sources">Discussion: Sources</a>).</p>
                     <p>According to the narrative of Volume 1, while <span class="persName">Harry</span> and <span class="persName">Lucy</span> are visiting the seaside resort of <span class="placeName">Hastings</span>, <span class="persName">Harry</span> identifies the fourth day of their visit as “the longest day”, a remark that <span class="persName">Helen Gill Viljoen</span> interpreted as referring to the summer solstice (which fell on <span class="date">June 21 in 1826</span> and on <span class="date">June 22 in 1827</span>). <span class="persName">Viljoen</span> infers that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs composition date for Volume 1 must therefore be extended well past the terminus
                        a quo of <span class="date">January 1827</span> established by <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs gloss on <a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS I</span></a> to some time after <span class="date">June 1827</span> (“Dating MSS. of Boyhood”, in <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#VILJOENPAPERS"><span class="titlem">Viljoen Papers</span></a>, boxes D.V, E.IX).</p>
                     <p><span class="persName">Viljoen</span> discounted the possibility that <span class="persName">Harry</span>ʼs remark refers to a holiday that, in real life, had already occurred, in <span class="date">June 1826</span>, before <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> started work on <a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS I</span></a> according to <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs gloss. She rejected this interpretation presumably on the grounds that the family
                        could not have holidayed at the seaside in <span class="placeName">Hastings</span> during <span class="date">June 1826</span>, if they had already departed for <a class="link_ref" href="perth_note.php"><span class="placeName">Perth</span>, <span class="placeName">Scotland</span></a>, shortly after <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs birthday on <span class="date">May 10</span>. It is now known, however, that the family must have delayed a vacation that year,
                        since <span class="persName">John James</span> traveled for customer orders well past his birthday (see <a class="link_ref" href="tours_of_1826-27_note.php">Tours of 1826–27</a>). It is thus more plausible that, insofar as <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> drew on actual events that occurred at <span class="placeName">Hastings</span> to help form his tale, he referred to a trip of <span class="date">June 1826</span>, a few months prior to when <span class="persName">Margaret</span> notes that he began work on <a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS I</span></a>. (<span class="persName">W. G. Collingwood</span>, for his part, did not notice the clue about a “longest day”, and assumed that the
                        holiday must have preceded <span class="date">May 10</span>, occurring in “the spring of 1826”, but a visit to the seaside so early in the year
                        is unlikely [<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#WGCLIFEOFJR1893"><span class="persName">Collingwood</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Life and Work of John Ruskin</span> [1893]</span></a>, 1:25; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#WGCLIFEOFJR1900"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Life of John Ruskin</span> [1900]</span></a>, 21].). </p>
                     <p>Greater uncertainty surrounds an alleged association of Volume 1 with a family journey
                        north to <span class="placeName">Scotland</span> in the autumn of <span class="date">1826</span>, an event that <span class="persName">W. G. Collingwood</span> drew from his reading of <a class="link_ref" href="on_scotland_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“On Scotland”</span></a> in <a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS I</span></a> and of <a class="link_ref" href="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Glen of Glenfarg” (“Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill”)</span></a>) in <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III</span></a> (see <a class="link_ref" href="tours_of_1826-27_note.php">Tours of 1826–27</a>). While such a scenario can be dovetailed with <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs dating of <span class="titlem">MS I</span> by imagining <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs starting the first volume of “Harry and Lucy” in “about <span class="date">Sep<sup>t</sup> or Oct 1826</span>” during the journey itself or shortly following the familyʼs return to <a class="link_ref" href="camberwell_note.php"><span class="placeName">Camberwell</span></a>, it seems odd that the volumeʼs sole purported witness to a Scottish journey is a
                        single poem, while Volume 2 of “Harry and Lucy,” written the following year in <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III</span></a>, contains an extensive account of a visit to <span class="placeName">Perth</span>. It is possible, of course, that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> merely saved that material for the second volume. It is also possible that, as proposed
                        in <a class="link_ref" href="tours_of_1826-27_note.php">Tours of 1826–27</a>, the family journeyed to <span class="placeName">Scotland</span> only in <span class="date">1827</span>, not in <span class="date">1826</span>, and that the only recent travel available to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> to describe in Volume 1 was the seaside visit that lay in the opposite direction,
                        southward to <span class="placeName">Hastings</span>.</p>

                     <p>No draft survives of volume 1 of <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span>, but the text in <span class="titlem">MS I</span> shows indications that it is a fair copy based on a lost draft. Given <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs attention to the physical appearance of his text, it is not credible that he could
                        have composed and fair‐copied the text simultaneously in this <a class="link_ref" href="red_book_note.php">Red Book</a>, <span class="titlem">MS I</span>. His attention to the material forms of his models was minute. For his title page,
                        he not only imitated the layout of the printed title page of <a class="link_ref" href="edgeworth_harry_and_lucy_concluded_note.php"><span class="persName">Maria Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</span></span></a>; he also copied the letterforms of the serif typefaces used in printing that text
                        as well as <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank: A Sequel</span></span>, both of which were published by <span class="orgName">Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy</span>. (For <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs copies of these published texts, see <a class="link_ref" href="boyhood_books_note.php#DESCRIPTIONS">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Physical Descriptions</a>.) He extended his use of these letterforms to pattern decorative capitals used throughout
                        his text (see also <a class="link_ref" href="hand_note.php#RUSKINSHANDEARLYPRINTPENCIL">The Ruskin Family Handwriting: <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs Early Print Lettering in Pencil</a>). Besides this exacting attention required for fair‐copying, further evidence of
                        a probable lost draft is suggested by insertions in the fair‐copy text, which are
                        most convincingly explained as correcting errors of transcription, rather than as
                        second thoughts in original composition (for details, see the textual glosses appended
                        to the <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_vol1_msi.php"><span class="titlem">MS I</span> witness</a>).</p>
                     <p>Composition may have entailed two distinct stages of draft. While the four or five
                        months comprised by <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs dating of <span class="titlem">MS I</span> could account for fair‐copying and perhaps some simultaneous drafting of <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy Concluded . . . Vol 1”</span> and <a class="link_ref" href="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Poetry” [MS I Poetry Anthology]</span></a> (see <a class="link_ref" href="#DATEOFCOMPOSITIONVOL1" title="Volume 1">Date of Composition: Volume 1</a>), internal evidence suggests that chapter 1 of the prose narrative may be based on
                        a distinctly earlier stage of composition. At the start of chapter 2, the narrative
                        exhibits an abrupt shift from direct dialogue to third‐person narration. For the first
                        time in the text, a narrator addresses the reader, and the dialogue carries such tags
                        as “said her <span class="persName">mother</span>” and “answered her <span class="persName">father</span>”. Moreover, the shift in narrative technique is accompanied by new characters appearing
                        on the scene. In chapter 1, the dialogue is limited to <span class="persName">Lucy</span> and <span class="persName">Mamma</span>, whereas <span class="persName">Papa</span> is said to be away from home in the City. In chapter 2, <span class="persName">Papa</span> comes home, has a brief exchange with <span class="persName">Lucy</span>, and then, as the narrator informs us, “<span class="persName">Lucy</span> has gone to bed and we shall have time to attend to <span class="persName">harry</span> whose history we have hitherto forgot”.</p>
                     <p>Two stages of composition also are suggested by the sources behind the text. Following
                        the change in narrative technique in chapter 2, the exchanges between characters—which
                        tend to be three‐way between <span class="persName">Papa</span>, <span class="persName">Harry</span>, and <span class="persName">Lucy</span>, largely excluding <span class="persName">Mamma</span>—appear to be modeled predominantly on <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank: A Sequel</span></span> and <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</span></span>. In chapter 1, the evidence of adaptation from these texts is less certain. A likelier
                        inspiration for chapter 1 may be <a class="link_ref" href="barbauld_anna_laetitia_note.php"><span class="persName">Anna Laetitia Barbauld</span></a>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span>. Like <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs conversations between <span class="persName">Lucy</span> and <span class="persName">Mamma</span> in chapter 1, <span class="persName">Barbauld</span>ʼs dialogues consist largely of direct discourse without intervention by a narrator.
                        <span class="persName">Barbauld</span>ʼs influence may also have contributed to the feminine gendering of the subjects in
                        <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs first chapter, along with allocation of a preceptorial role to <span class="persName">Mamma</span>, whereas the more masculine emphasis in chapter 2 and afterward—notable in the preceptorial
                        role shifting to the father, and indeed in the near erasure of <span class="persName">Mamma</span>, though not of <span class="persName">Lucy</span>, from the dialogues—reflect <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs emphasis on the mentorship of <span class="persName">Frank</span> by his father, and of <span class="persName">Harry</span> and <span class="persName">Lucy</span> by their father along with avuncular figures like <span class="persName">Sir Rupert Digby</span>.</p>

                  <p>The genre that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> imitates and adapts in his <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span> series is the <a class="link_ref" href="lesson_note.php">lesson</a> in dialogue form, as developed by <a class="link_ref" href="barbauld_anna_laetitia_note.php"><span class="persName"><span class="persName">Anna Letitia Barbauld</span> (<span class="date">1743–1825</span>)</span></a> and her brother <span class="persName">John Aikin</span> (<span class="date">1747–1822</span>); <a class="link_ref" href="edgeworth_maria_note.php"><span class="persName">Maria Edgeworth</span> (<span class="date">1768–1849</span>)</a> and her father, <span class="persName">Richard Lovell Edgeworth</span> (<span class="date">1744–1817</span>); <a class="link_ref" href="joyce_jeremiah_note.php"><span class="persName">Jeremiah Joyce</span> (<span class="date">1763–1816</span>)</a>; and others. Judging by textual traces in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs dialogues that can be specifically identified, the most prominent of these sources
                     for <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I”</span> were the final volumes in the Edgeworthsʼ series (authored fully by <span class="persName">Maria</span>), <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank: A Sequel to Frank in Early Lessons</span></span>, and <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded, Being the Last Part of Early Lessons</span></span>, along with <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span>, which is frequently referenced likewise in <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs final volumes of “Early Lessons”. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs adaptation was therefore up to date. When he began Volume 1 of his own <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy Concluded”</span> in <span class="date">1826</span>, <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs book of that title, the latest and last in the series of “Early Lessons”, had been
                     published just the previous year, in <span class="date">1825</span>, while <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank: A Sequel</span></span>, was also recent, first published in <span class="date">1822</span>. The Ruskins owned these books in first‐edition copies, which survive. The copy of
                     <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank: A Sequel</span></span> contains more marginalia from early boyhood than does the surviving copy of <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</span></span>, which contains some possible markings from <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs youth but mostly marginalia from his maturity (see <a class="link_ref" href="boyhood_books_note.php#DESCRIPTIONS">Books Used by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> in His Youth: Physical Descriptions</a>).</p>
                  <p>There appears no definite textual evidence that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs sources included the preceding volumes in the Edgeworthsʼ “Early Lessons” series—<span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Harry and Lucy</span></span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Rosamond</span></span>, and <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank</span></span>, which started publication in <span class="date">1801</span>, and which were designed for younger children. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> may have been familiar at this time with the stories in <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Parentʼs Assistant</span></span>, which was published in its first version in <span class="date">1796</span>, and which he listed among his books in <span class="date">1873</span> as a six‐volume edition, which <span class="persName">Dearden</span> dates as <span class="date">1822</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Library of John Ruskin</span></span></a>, 105 [no. 816]). The text more likely to have served as a prelude to the sophisticated
                     dialogues in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank: A Sequel</span></span> and <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</span></span> was <a class="link_ref" href="barbauld_anna_laetitia_note.php"><span class="persName"><span class="persName">Barbauld</span></span></a> and <span class="persName">Aikin</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span> (<span class="date">1792–96</span>)—a book that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> certainly possessed and used extensively (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><span class="persName">Dearden</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Library of John Ruskin</span></span></a>, 8 [no. 34]; and see <a class="link_ref" href="boyhood_books_note.php#DESCRIPTIONS">Books Used by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> in His Youth: Physical Descriptions</a>). This text was probably as significant as the <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span> books in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs development of the childʼs voice in his own dialogues (see Personae).</p>
                  <p>Finally, toward the end of volume 1 of his <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy Concluded”</span> <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> copied extensively from <a class="link_ref" href="joyce_jeremiah_note.php"><span class="persName">Jeremiah Joyce</span></a>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span> (first published in six volumes, <span class="date">1800–1805</span>; the edition used by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> is apparently unknown). While <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs treatment of the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span> remains to some extent implicitly embedded in <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs narrative, dependent on the frame of the story where the lessons are referenced,
                     <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs clustering of paraphrases of <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs experiments at the end of volume 1 suggests that he viewed them as <span class="persName">Joyce</span> intended—as a sequel to introductory natural history presented in <span class="persName">Barbauld</span> and <span class="persName">Aikin</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span>, and as a realization of the rudimentary instruction in science as recommended by
                     the Edgeworths in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Practical Education</span></span> (<span class="date">1798</span>) (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><span class="persName">Joyce</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span></a>, 1:1, vii–x; and see <span class="persName">Fyfe</span>, <span class="titlem">“Young Readers and the Sciences”</span>, 282; and see also <a class="link_ref" href="#BIOGRAPHY" title="Biographical Context and RealLife Lessons">Biographical Context</a>).</p>
                  <p>As suggested in <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPOSITION" title="Composition">Composition</a>, chapter 1 of volume 1 of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy Concluded”</span> may reflect an earlier stage of composition, one modeled on <span class="persName">Barbauld</span> and <span class="persName">Aikin</span>ʼs dialogues and stories, which were recommended for children younger than the intended
                     audience of <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs concluding volumes in the <span style="font-style:italic">Early Lessons</span> series. It would have been in keeping with these educatorsʼ plan for age‐specific
                     reading for <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> to have patterned his chapter 1 on more elementary reading. Although none of the
                     youthful marginalia and drawings in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs surviving boyhood books can be dated, the physical evidence suggests that he did
                     at least read <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank: A Sequel</span></span> prior to grappling with the advanced <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</span></span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="boyhood_books_note.php#DESCRIPTIONS">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Physical Descriptions</a>). The heavier use evident in his copy of <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank: A Sequel</span></span> indicates that, at age seven, he was just inside the scope of ages seven to ten or
                     eleven that <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span> intended for this book. At age seven going on eight, however, when he composed volume
                     1 of his <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="#DATEOFCOMPOSITIONVOL1" title="Volume 1">Date of Composition</a>), he was definitely a precocious student of <span class="persName">Jeremiah Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span>, which was aimed at children aged ten to eleven, and of <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</span></span>, which was meant for readers aged ten to fourteen (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank: A Sequel</span></span></a>, 1:x; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span></a>, 1:viii; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</span></span></a>, 1:vii).</p>

                           Hill Setting</span></h4>
                     <p><span class="persName">Aileen Fyfe</span> has compared the dialogues in <span class="persName">Aikin</span> and <span class="persName">Barbauld</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span> to those in <span class="persName">Sarah Trimmer</span>ʼs (<span class="date">1741–1810</span>) <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">An Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature, and Reading the Holy Scriptures,
                              Adapted to the Capacities of Children</span></span> (<span class="date">1780</span>) in order to highlight the differences in pedagogical approach to science, as adopted
                        respectively by <span class="orgName">Unitarian</span> and by <span class="orgName">Church of England</span> childrenʼs authors in the late eighteenth century. Seeking to understand particularly
                        the effect of these approaches on readers, <span class="persName">Fyfe</span> suggests that <span class="persName">Barbauld</span> and <span class="persName">Aikin</span> inspired child readers to become active inquirers. In the dialogues in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings</span></span>, the fictional children take the initiative in prompting dialogue with their adult
                        interlocutors, and they freely make observations, hazard connections, and draw conclusions.
                        <span class="persName">Trimmer</span>ʼs fictional children, in contrast, are passively guided by their mother, whose voice
                        dominates the text. She directs the childrenʼs attention to natural phenomena and
                        tells the children what to think about them, using the terms of natural theology.
                        The difference reflects a philosophical clash between a Rousseauist belief in enfranchising
                        children to discover the world for themselves, and a conservative <span class="orgName">Christian</span> commitment to guard children against sinful influences, from both within the self
                        and without. <span class="persName">Aikin</span> and <span class="persName">Barbauld</span> encourage discovery and curiosity regarding a wide variety of subjects, which includes
                        science for both boys and girls, albeit to distinct ends. <span class="persName">Trimmer</span> prioritizes religious teaching, embracing natural history only as a means to inspire
                        awe in the revelation of Godʼs design for the world, while ruling out scientific learning
                        that is unmediated by religion as dangerous and likely overly abstruse as well (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#FYFECOPYRIGHTS"><span class="persName">Fyfe</span>, <span class="titlem">“Reading Childrenʼs Books”</span>, [<span class="date">1999</span>]</a> 468–72, 456–64).</p>
                     <p>Admonitory religious voices like Mrs. <span class="persName">Trimmer</span>ʼs persona are represented among <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs surviving early books of tales and poems for children, but there is no evidence
                        specifically of books of natural history that take <span class="persName">Trimmer</span>ʼs approach (see <a class="link_ref" href="boyhood_books_note.php#DESCRIPTIONS">Books Used by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> in His Youth: Physical Descriptions</a>). On the evidence of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs own <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span>, in which he adapts the genre of the educational dialogue to his own domestic setting,
                        the tone suggests that he absorbed the stance of <span class="persName">Barbauld</span> and <span class="persName">Aikin</span>ʼs uninhibited inquirer. In volume 1, chapter 1, which, as proposed in <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPOSITION" title="Composition">Composition</a>, probably reflects the most direct influence of <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span>, <span class="persName">Lucy</span> takes the initiative in directing the topic and development of discourse. She declares
                        what she will do: outside the house, she will visit her rabbit; inside the house,
                        she will draw a head. While <span class="persName">Mamma</span> imposes checks on willfulness (<span class="persName">Lucy</span> cannot go outside in the rain; inside, she should “do one thing at once” and finish
                        her landscape before drawing the head), <span class="persName">Lucy</span> easily diverts <span class="persName">Mamma</span> from captious control. <span class="persName">Mamma</span> does wrest the lead in conversation by inquiring about the condition of <span class="persName">Lucy</span>ʼs silkworms—a topic that leads to an opening to quiz <span class="persName">Lucy</span> on addition. But <span class="persName">Lucy</span> turns the tables and stumps her mother with abstruse questions about silkworms—the
                        answers to which <span class="persName">Mamma</span> might have known had she read <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</span></span> as carefully as <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Lucy</span> evidently has done. In short, this is a household of surprises, which can catch up
                        both <span class="persName">Lucy</span> and <span class="persName">Mamma</span>: before <span class="persName">Lucy</span> can draw anything, she must find her pencils, which <span class="persName">Mamma</span> is amazed to discover in her workbox.</p>
                     <p>That <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> inhabited this freer and more inquisitive child persona, as compared with Mrs. <span class="persName">Trimmer</span>ʼs silently compliant children, is not necessarily surprising for his decade. <span class="persName">Fyfe</span> remarks that, whereas in the <span class="date">1790s</span> the progressive <span class="orgName">Unitarian</span> pedagogical methods in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span> raised alarms among <span class="orgName">Church of England</span> book reviewers, including Mrs. <span class="persName">Trimmer</span>, by the <span class="date">1820s</span> <span class="persName">Aikin</span> and <span class="persName">Barbauld</span>ʼs approach had been integrated into the home educations practiced by both <span class="orgName">Anglican</span> and <span class="orgName">Dissenter</span> families. By this time, readersʼ responses to <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span> had shifted, as shown by testimony of Victorians who were born around <span class="date">1820</span>, and who, like <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, treasured their childhood memories of <span class="persName">Barbauld</span> and <span class="persName">Aikin</span>ʼs book. <span class="persName">Fyfe</span> takes this record of response as proof that the authorsʼ policy of avoiding direct
                        religious commentary—an absence that <span class="persName">Trimmer</span> considered sufficiently damning in itself—succeeded in ultimately making the book
                        acceptable to a wider audidence. Similarly, the <span class="persName">Edgeworths</span> avoided potentially devisive religious topics in their educational dialogues, fearing
                        that controversy would undermine the universality of rational and practical thinking
                        they sought to cultivate (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#FYFECOPYRIGHTS"><span class="persName">Fyfe</span>, <span class="titlem">“Reading Childrenʼs Books”</span>, [<span class="date">1999</span>]</a>, 465–66, 462–63, 472).</p>
                     <p>On the question of <span class="persName">Barbauld</span>ʼs reception by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs generation, see also <a class="link_ref" href="barbauld_anna_laetitia_note.php"><span class="persName">Barbauld</span></a>. <span class="persName">William McCarthy</span> takes a more sardonic view of what he regards as a project of rehabilitation by <span class="persName">Barbauld</span>ʼs niece and others to disassociate the writer from radical positions like Wollstonecraftian
                        feminism. The purge, he believes, was achieved by narrowing <span class="persName">Barbauld</span>ʼs reputation to childrenʼs writing, reducing her to “a sort of national nanny”. <span class="persName">McCarthy</span> quotes a writer for the <span class="titlem">Edinburgh Review</span> in <span class="date">1829</span>—the period when <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> was first reading <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span>—who describes works like the “Hymns and Early Lessons of Mrs Barbauld” as exemplary
                        of the “proper and natural business” of writing by women, which “is the practical
                        regulation of private life, in all its bearings, affections, and concerns” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#MCCARTHYBARBAULDRECEPTION"><span class="persName">McCarthy</span>, <q class="titlea">“‘A High‐Minded Christian Lady’”</q>, [<span class="date">1999</span>]</a> 177–78).</p>

                  <h3><span class="headingNumber">1.7.2. </span><span class="head">Biographical Context and Real‐Life Lessons</span></h3>
                  <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> begins volume 1 with the fatherʼs absence, <span class="persName">Lucy</span> remarking “<span class="persName">papa</span> has gone out to town earlyer than usual”; and when <span class="persName">Papa</span> comes home at the start of chapter 2, his presence significantly eclipses <span class="persName">Mamma</span>ʼs role as interlocutor in the text. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> even neglects to make a place for <span class="persName">Mamma</span> in the seating arrangements of the traveling carriage that carries the family on
                     the excursion to <span class="placeName">Hastings</span> (see contextual glosses for volume 1). At the beach, <span class="persName">Mamma</span> is represented as a voice calling <span class="persName">Harry</span> to lessons, a voice he “did not hear” and “staid away a whole hour later than he
                     should” (chap. 10). <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs desire for his real father during <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs lengthy business travels can therefore be taken as a powerful emotion animating
                     his adaptation of the lesson in dialogue form, just as he makes that desire an explicit
                     theme in the poems that fill the remaining space in his <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span> Red Books (<a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS I</span></a>, <a class="link_ref" href="msii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS II</span></a>, <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III</span></a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="msiiia_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS IIIA</span></a>; and see, e.g., <a class="link_ref" href="on_papas_leaving_home_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“On Papaʼs Leaving Home”</span></a> and <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span></a>). At the same time, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs adaptation of the dialogue form to represent domestic life at <span class="placeName">Herne Hill</span> delivers at times convincing and lively exchanges between his female characters,
                     <span class="persName">Lucy</span> and <span class="persName">Mamma</span>.</p>
                  <p>While <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs narrative can be read biographically for an emotional truth, his <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span> is strikingly embedded in its textual origins, albeit creatively so. <span class="persName">Aileen Fyfe</span> comments that the appeal of eighteenth‐ and nineteenth‐century books of science for
                     children lay in the practical applications that readers could undertake in real life
                     (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#FYFETRACTS"><span class="titlem">“Tracts, Classics and Brands”</span></a>, 213). In <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span>, however, the dialogues often seem less a record of “early lessons” put in practice
                     at <span class="placeName">Herne Hill</span> than a fantasized praxis at one remove—<span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Harry</span> enacting imaginatively what <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs, <span class="persName">Barbauld</span>ʼs, and <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs fictional children do. Certainly, some portions of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs narrative can be most convincingly explained in terms of direct experience (see
                     <a class="link_ref" href="#TRAVEL" title="Records of the Ruskin Family Travels">“Records of the Ruskin Family Travel”</a>). But a number of the scientific experiments lifted from <span class="persName">Joyce</span> and <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span> were obviously too exotic or dangerous to have been been permitted to disturb the
                     peace of <span class="placeName">Herne Hill</span> (e.g., <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Lucy</span> tending to silkworms, or <span class="persName">Harry</span> setting off gunpowder); and specialized apparatus such as the air pump, though omnipresent
                     in the world of <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Harry</span> and <span class="persName">Lucy</span>, seems unlikely to have been household objects in <span class="placeName">Camberwell</span>. <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs meticulous household accounts reveal largesse with books for the library but nothing
                     for a laboratory. (In <span class="date">eighteenth‐century</span> popular science lectures for the middling classes, the use of instruments tended
                     to be emphasized as an alternative to the forbidding mathematics required to understand
                     <span class="titlem">Newtonʼs Principia</span>; see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HUANGTHEATRES"><span class="persName">Huang</span>, <span class="titlem">“Theatres, Toys, and Teaching Aids”</span></a>, 136–42.)</p>
                  <p>Nonetheless, the bookish quality of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs appropriation of experiments may in itself shed light on a biographical connection.
                     A surviving book from the Ruskin family library that is inscribed as an early possession
                     of <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span> rather than of <span class="persName">John</span>, is <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Conversations on Chemistry</span></span> by <span class="persName">Jane Marcet</span> (<span class="date">1769–1858</span>), a popular writer on science and political economy. (See <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><span class="persName">Dearden</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Library of John Ruskin</span></span></a>, 187 [no. 1433], where <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs <span class="date">1809</span> copy of <span class="persName">Marcet</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Conversations</span></span> is misattributed to <a class="link_ref" href="joyce_jeremiah_note.php"><span class="persName">Jeremiah Joyce</span></a>, and the book confused with the provenance of <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span> in the Ruskin household. <span class="persName">Joyce</span> did author a similarly titled <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Dialogues in Chemistry, Intended for the Instruction and Entertainment of Young People</span></span> [<span class="date">1807</span>], but if <span class="persName">Dearden</span>ʼs bibliographical details are correct, it is undoubtedly <span class="persName">Marcet</span>ʼs book that <span class="persName">John James</span> owned.)</p>
                  <p><span class="persName">Marcet</span> first published the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Conversations</span></span> in <span class="date">1805</span>, close on the heels of <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span> (which she represents as having co‐opted rather than having influenced her own project).
                     She wrote the book for the edification of women, particularly as a preliminary foundation
                     for fashionable women who attended the public lectures designed to introduce the British
                     public to abstruse scientific topics but which too often only bewildered their audiences
                     with terminology and concepts over their heads (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#MARCETCONVERSATIONSONCHEMISTRY"><span class="persName">Marcet</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Conversations on Chemistry</span></span></a>, 1:v–x). The complaint is dramatized in an episode by <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span> in which a pompous lecturer on astronomy puts an audience of children to sleep “listening
                     to a vast number of words . . . of which nearly half were nothing to the purpose”.
                     Even an eager boy like <span class="persName">Frank</span>, “after all his reading in [<span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs] <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span>, had much difficulty sometimes in understanding . . . [and] ‘how much more difficult
                     it would have been . . . unless I had read the description and explanation beforehand’”
                     (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank: A Sequel</span></span></a>, 2:249, 255–56). In his earlier days in <span class="placeName">London</span>, <span class="persName">John James</span> often attended lectures; and it seems consistent with his habits of self‐culture
                     that, as an aspiring wine merchant, he would have educated himself in a basic course
                     of chemistry; and that he would have acquired <span class="persName">Marcet</span>ʼs popular text, regardless of its specified female audience, to privide a foundation
                     of concepts and glossary of technical terms. What this opening on <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs scientific self‐culture may reveal is a scenario for father and sonʼs—and motherʼs—home
                     schooling with these scientific dialogues as shared texts. See <a class="link_ref" href="#EDUCATION" title="Trying This at Home Ruskins Adaptation of the Educational Dialogue to the Herne Hill Setting">Reflections of Educational Approaches</a> for how <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs written dialogues may incorporate the pedagogical method recommended for such study
                     sessions.</p>
                  <p>How the Ruskins may have employed these educational texts as a family is lost to us,
                     but <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs written dialogues mention some hands‐on projects, which are independently documented
                     in the family letters. In <span class="date">May 1826</span>, <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span> reported to her husband that <span class="persName">John</span> had almost finished a “cave”. Whether this object was three‐ or two‐dimensional,
                     it appears to have been inspired by Robinson Crusoeʼs refuge on his island; and play
                     associated with it may have given rise to a fantastical episode in volume 1 of <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span>, in which <span class="persName">Mamma</span> is seated inside a cave to observe a motley parade of animals (<a class="link_ref" href="mr_to_jjr_1826-05-25_al_apparatus.xml"><span class="titlem">Margaret to John James Ruskin, 25 May 1826</span></a>, in <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="persName">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a>, 149; and see “Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I”, chaps. 4–5). Another project described
                     in volume 3 of <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span> may also have been based on a material object, a puppet show. While the construction
                     described by <span class="persName">Harry</span> suggests a homemade project, it may have been based on or incorporated a product
                     commonly available in stationersʼ shops in the first half of the century. Printed
                     sheets contained the sections of a proscenium, which could be cut out to form a toy
                     theater, while other sheets held characters from popular plays to be cut out and mounted
                     on sticks for acting out performances (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SHERIKOPATCHWORKPLAY"><span class="persName">Sheriko</span>, <span class="titlem">“Patchwork Play”</span></a>).</p>

                     <p><span class="persName">W. G. Collingwood</span> was certain that the content of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="titlem">Harry and Lucy</span> narratives could be easily sorted between categories of real and “ideal”, and that
                        the travel accounts were self‐evidently biographical: “His <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span> is mainly a dramatised account of tours; himself being <span class="persName">Harry</span>, with an imaginary sister, studied from <span class="persName">Jessie of Perth</span> or <span class="persName">Bridget of Croydon</span>, for he had nobody then to act permanently in that capacity, as his cousin <span class="persName">Mary</span> did afterwards. The moralising <span class="persName">mamma</span>, and literary <span class="persName">papa</span> represent his parents to the life” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#WGCLIFEOFJR1893"><span class="persName">Collingwood</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Life and Work of John Ruskin</span></span> [<span class="date">1893</span></a>], 1:24). <span class="persName">Collingwood</span>ʼs discernment of autobiographical “truth” from fiction was based, one suspects, on
                        extending the charm of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs description of boyhood travels in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Praeterita</span></span> to the travel narratives from fifty years earlier. He ignored, or was not aware,
                        that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs model, the original <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</span></span> by <span class="persName">Maria Edgeworth</span>, likewise contains a lengthy account of a domestic tour—perhaps the first travel
                        narrative that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> read as a youth, apart from adventure tales such as <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Robinson Crusoe</span></span>. <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs child characters accompany their parents for a lengthy sojourn at a seaside cottage,
                        just as <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span> visit one of the seaside resorts that were attracting an increasingly middle-class
                        tourism clientele in the early nineteenth century (see <a class="link_ref" href="seaside_resorts_note.php">The Ruskinsʼ Visits to Seaside Resorts and Spas</a>). <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs family travels from the northwest of <span class="placeName">England</span> to the southwest coast near <span class="placeName">Bristol</span>, stopping along the way at sites showcasing <span class="placeName">Britain</span>ʼs industrial achievements from the late eighteenth century. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span> journey in the opposite direction, to the southeast coast at <span class="placeName">Hastings</span>, taking in highlights of picturesque landscape. While differing in emphasis, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs travelogue derives structural elements from <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs book to frame the journey, and he also imports some entirely fictional details.</p>
                     <p>As explained in the contextual glosses to <span class="titlem">volume 1</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> borrowed from <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs narrative to describe his <span class="persName">Harry</span> and <span class="persName">Lucy</span>ʼs excited departure for the seacoast. An adaptation from <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span> is probably also responsible for an awkward segue where <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> drops his travel narrative because his <span class="persName">Harry</span> is “determined to go on with science”—a long section of the volume consisting of
                        a rote rehearsal of experiments copied from <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span>. While <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span> of course does not plagiarize from <span class="persName">Joyce</span>, the seacoast destination of her fictional family seems nearly incidental to the
                        educational goal of the journey, which is to enhance the childrenʼs “practical education”
                        with on‐site demonstrations of industry and science that they would otherwise have
                        to gather from books. Along the road south to <span class="placeName">Bristol</span>, they tour mills and factories in the <span class="geogName">Midlands</span> to understand how the industries are powered and organized. When settled in their
                        seaside cottage, the children are ascribed a single episode of sublime encounter with
                        the sea; otherwise, their main attraction is access to the extensively equipped “workroom”
                        and library at Digby Castle, the residence of their seaside landlord, <span class="persName">Sir Rupert Digby</span>. The castle offers fabulous opportunities for applied learning—a sort of nineteenth‐century
                        Epcot Center set inside a Disney castle featuring Gothic Revival exhibits such as
                        a great hall and a hermitage. <span class="persName">Sir Rupert</span> is an idealized master of ceremonies, an avuncular character who oversees a largesse
                        of books and scientific equipment. Thus, when <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> determines that his <span class="persName">Harry</span> must “go on with science”, he is not just filling space, but imitating the focus
                        of <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs children on experiments in <span class="persName">Sir Rupert</span>ʼs wonderful workroom, where the “favourite book” of <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Harry</span>, <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span>, “assisted” him in his investigations (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</span></span></a>, 3:319).</p>
                     <p>Yet, while <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> relies on <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs tale for ways to frame his travelogue (and borrows directly from <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span> for an exciting episode involving an exploding wagon, which occurs along the road
                        to <span class="placeName">Hastings</span>), his account of <span class="persName">Harry</span> and <span class="persName">Lucy</span> at <span class="placeName">Hastings</span> fundamentally differs from his source in its relish for the seashore and the surrounding
                        cliffs. Apart from the series of experiments copied from <span class="persName">Joyce</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs account reflects little of <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs educational program. Instead, his narrative aligns convincingly with multiple travel
                        guides to <span class="placeName">Hastings</span> from the period, without copying directly from them. As detailed in the contextual
                        glosses, <span class="persName">Harry</span>ʼs walks with his <span class="persName">Papa</span> on the heights above the town follow the topography of the place; and his activities
                        in a boat, on the shore, and in a hotel reflect the tourism industry in <span class="placeName">Hastings</span> of the <span class="date">1820s</span>. Sowewhat less clearly recognizable, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs description of the road trip from <span class="placeName">London</span> to the coast is at least reconcilable with the route through <span class="placeName">Tunbridge Wells</span> that the <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> family probably followed. There survives no independent evidence to confirm the fact
                        or the dates of this journey (see <a class="link_ref" href="tours_of_1826-27">Tours of <span class="date">1826–27</span></a>). Nonetheless, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs account of the visit to <span class="placeName">Hastings</span> proper, as opposed to how he frames the beginning and end of the visit, is not carried
                        out in a laboratory but through activities associated with the picturesque—viewing,
                        walking, collecting, drawing. While <span class="persName">Collingwood</span> too readily assumed that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs tale recorded experience “to the life” with just the names changed, his instinct
                        was sound for the authenticity of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs engagement with the picturesque tour, which corresponds to the recommendations
                        of <span class="placeName">Hastings</span> guidebooks of the period but is not copied from those sources, so far as presently
                        discovered.</p>
                     <p>Dovetailing the end of <span class="titlem">volume 1 of “Harry and Lucy”</span> with the beginnning of the next, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> locates his characters at <span class="placeName">Hastings</span> at the start of <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_vol2_apparatus.php">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol. 2”</a>. Although he did not begin composition until several months later, in <span class="date">fall or winter 1827</span>, <span class="titlem">volume 2</span> carries his family from the seaside to <span class="placeName">Wales</span> and <span class="placeName">Scotland</span>. . .</p>
