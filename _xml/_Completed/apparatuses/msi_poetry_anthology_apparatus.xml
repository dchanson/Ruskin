                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> could not have modeled the idea of appending a poetry anthology to his <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title> volumes on 
                            <persName corresp="#ME">Maria Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="lesson" corresp="#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><hi rend="italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</hi></title> or

                            primary inspirations for the <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref> narrative&#x2014;since 
                            <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s origingals contain no such feature. Instead, he might have encountered poetry anthologies in numerous places. 
                            The most likely source was the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="evangelical_magazine_note.php"><title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title></ref>, which <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> read regularly from <date when="1823">1823</date> and possibly earlier. 
                            From its founding in <date when="1793">1793</date>, each issue featured a brief collection of poems with a header similar to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s title for his anthology&#x2014;the single word &#x201C;Poetry&#x201D;, 
                            which in the magazine is printed in letter&#x2010;spaced capitals. Especially compelling for these monthly anthologies as an inspiration is their inclusion of occasional poems 
                            such as <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="new_years_poems.php">New Year&#x02BC;s Poems</ref> in the annual January issue, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> likewise composed annually as a present to his father. Unlike the majority of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poems, however, 
                            the poetry selected for anthologizing in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> was almost exclusively religious.</p>
                        
                        <p>Other sources that might have modelded poetry anthologies for early nineteenth&#x2010;century youths include 
                            <persName corresp="#ENFIELD">James Enfield</persName>&#x02BC;s anthology for instructing elocution,

                            as the result of a &#x201C;domestic plan&#x201D; that was followed by the Fairborne family of <placeName type="fictional" corresp="#BEECHGROVE">Beechgrove</placeName> for &#x201C;varying . . . [the] amusements&#x201D; 
                            and &#x201C;promoting the instruction and entertainment of the younger part&#x201D; of the &#x201C;numerous progeny of children of both sexes&#x201D;.

                            &#x201C;would frequently produce a fable, a story, or dialogue, adapted to the age and understanding of the young people&#x201D;. These compositions were 
                            &#x201C;always considered as a high favour&#x201D;, so that, &#x201C;when the pieces were once read over, they were carefully deposited by 
                            <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MRSFAIRBORNEAB">Mrs. Fairborne</persName> in a box, of which she kept the key:</p>

                                            One of the least children was sent to the box, who putting in its little hand, drew out the paper that came next, and brought it 
                                            into the parlour. This was then read distinctly by one of the older ones; and after it had undergone sufficient consideration, 
                                            another little messenger was dispatched for a fresh supply; and so on. . . . Other children were admitted to these readings,

                        <p><persName corresp="#JAIKIN">Aikin</persName> and <persName corresp="#ALB">Barbauld</persName>&#x02BC;s preference for &#x201C;pomiscuous&#x201D; ordering 
                            is a reminder of the flexibility that was advocated by educationists and their system of &#x201C;practical&#x201D; education. 
                            In the <title type="essay" corresp="EDGEWORTHADDRESS">&#x201C;Address to Mothers&#x201D;</title> by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="edgeworth_richard_lovell_note.php"><persName corresp="#RLE">Richard Lovell Edgeworth</persName></ref>, 
                            which prefaces some editions of <title type="lesson" corresp="#EDGEWORTHEARLYLESSONS"><hi rend="italic">Early Lessons</hi></title>, the writer insists on allowing even greater authority to the child&#x02BC;s 
                            &#x201C;little hand&#x201D;&#x2014;not just to sift at random and convey a reading, as in the case of the Fairborne child, but deliberately to select what reading is best &#x201C;adapted to [its] age and understanding&#x201D;. 
                            &#x201C;Well educated children&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#RLE">Edgeworth</persName> writes, &#x201C;are . . . the best judges of what is fit for children&#x201D;; and parents should &#x201C;select what they find upon trial 
                            to be the best for their immediate purpose, and to lay aside the rest for another opportunity&#x201D;. Whereas on the one hand the Edgeworths took care to arrange their books for children as a succession of 
                            age&#x2010;appropriate lessons pitched to the abilities of their readers&#x2014;from the most accessible &#x201C;early lessons&#x201D; in <title type="lesson" corresp="#EDGEWORTHFRANK"><hi rend="italic">Frank: A Book for Boys</hi></title> and

                            and the poetry anthology appended to it, he took advantage of both the graduated progression of the educationists&#x02BC; books and the permission to range at will. 
                            For youngest children, the <title type="essay" corresp="EDGEWORTHADDRESS">&#x201C;Address to Mothers&#x201D;</title> recommends works by

                            While pesumably <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s exposure to works for the nursery predated his project

                            Whereas the <title type="essay" corresp="EDGEWORTHADDRESS">&#x201C;Address to Mothers&#x201D;</title> recommends acquainting young children with natural history,

                    <p>The anthology brings to the surface <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s identity as a British subject with family ties
                        to <placeName corresp="#NBRITAIN">North Britain</placeName>. &#x201C;The Defiance of War&#x201D; may be most persuasively understood as a poem, not about an actual threat of military invasion, but about the
                        coalescence of British identity, <placeName corresp="#NBRITAIN">North</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">South</placeName>, in defiance of the European Other

                        Patriotism is supported by pride in late&#x2010;Enlightenment invention and entrepreneurship epitomized by

                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> must have realized that industrial progress could be credited to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> no less than to <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>. 
                        In <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>, where his relations lived, businessmen vied with <placeName corresp="#DUNDEE">Dundee</placeName> to uphold local dignity by establishing 
                        the town&#x02BC;s own steam packet company by <date when="1822">1822</date>, just in time to join the considerable steamer activity involved in the state visit by <persName corresp="#KG4">George IV</persName> to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>

                        At the same time, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> imagines <placeName corresp="#NBRITAIN">North Britain</placeName> as a preserve of preindustrial nature and history,

                            and the boy&#x02BC;s joy in his father&#x02BC;s return. Two poems, <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#THENEEDLESSALARM">&#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;</title></ref> and

                            probe the uncertainties of safety in a home. A particular threat to security and happiness may lie behind an elegiac note in

                            At the same time, if these poems reveal anxieties, the poems also work to resolve such tensions.</p>
