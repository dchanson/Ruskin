                            the &#x201C;juvenile budget,&#x201D; <title type="lesson" rend="italic" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS">Evenings at Home</title>, came to be collected and opened to view 
                            as the result of a &#x201C;domestic plan&#x201D; that was followed by the Fairborne family of Beechgrove for &#x201C;varying . . . [the] amusements&#x201D; 
                            and &#x201C;promoting the instruction and entertainment of the younger part&#x201D; of the &#x201C;numerous progeny of children of both sexes.&#x201D; 
                            Friends and relations of the family, &#x201C;who were entertained with cheerfulness and hospitality, free from ceremony and parade,&#x201D; 
                            &#x201C;would frequently produce a fable, a story, or dialogue, adapted to the age and understanding of the young people.&#x201D; These compositions were 
                            &#x201C;always considered as a high favour,&#x201D; so that, &#x201C;when the pieces were once read over, they were carefully deposited by 
                            Mrs. Fairborne in a box, of which she kept the key:
                            <hi rend="center">None of these [writings] were allowed to be taken out again till all the children were assembled in the holidays. 
                            It was then made one of the evening amusements of the family to <hi rend="italic">rummage the budget</hi>, as their phrase was. 
                            One of the least children was sent to the box, who putting in its little hand, drew out the paper that came next, and brought it into the parlour. 
                            This was then read distinctly by one of the older ones; and after it had undergone sufficient consideration, 
                            another little messenger was dispatched for a fresh supply; and so on. . . . Other children were admitted to these readings, 
                            and as the <hi rend="italic">Budget of Beechgrove Hall</hi> became somewhat celebrated in the neighbourhood, 
                            its proprietors were at length urged to lay it open to the public. They were induced to comply; and have presented its contents in the promiscuous order 
                            in which they came to hand, which they think will prove more agreeable than a methodical arrangement.

                        <p>This preference for &#x201C;pomiscuous&#x201D; ordering is a reminder of the flexibility that was advocated by educationists and their system of &#x201C;practical&#x201D; education.

                            which prefaces some editions of <title type="lesson" rend="italic" corresp="#EDGEWORTHEARLYLESSONS">Early Lessons</title>, the writer insists on allowing even greater authority to the child&#x02BC;s 
                            &#x201C;little hand&#x201D;&#x2014;not just to sift at random and convey a reading, as in the case of the Fairborne child, but deliberately to select what reading is best &#x201C;adapted to [its] age and understanding.&#x201D; 
                            &#x201C;Well educated children,&#x201D; Edgeworth writes, &#x201C;are . . . the best judges of what is fit for children&#x201D;; and parents should &#x201C;select what they find upon trial 
                            to be the best for their immediate purpose, and to lay aside the rest for another opportunity.&#x201D; Whereas on the one hand the Edgeworths took care to arrange their books for children as a succession of 
                            age&#x2010;appropriate &#x201C;lessons&#x201D; pitched to the abilities of their readers&#x2014;from the most accessible dialogues in <hi rend="italic">Frank</hi>, 
                            to the first part of <hi rend="italic">Harry and Lucy</hi>, to <hi rend="italic">Rosamond</hi>, and finally to the later parts of <hi rend="italic">Harry and Lucy</hi>&#x2014;on the other hand, the Edgeworths emphasized that 
                            &#x201C;different parts of . . . [these books] are suited to the tastes of different children, as well as to children of different ages&#x201D;

                            and the poetry anthology appended to it, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> took advantage of both the graduated progression of the educationists&#x02BC; books and the permission to range at will. 
                        For youngest children, the <title type="essay" corresp="EDGEWORTHADDRESS">&#x201C;Address to Mothers&#x201D;</title> recommends works by

                            and then <persName corresp="#JAIKIN">Aikin</persName> and <persName corresp="#ALB">Barbauld</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="lesson" rend="italic" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS">Evenings at Home</title>. 
                            While pesumably <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s exposure to some of the works for the nursery in these collections predated his project

                            retains vestiges of that earliest reading. At the same time, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> ranged freely, often imitating texts beyond his years. 
                            The &#x201C;Address to Mothers&#x201D; recommends acquainting young children with natural history, 
                        but it advises delaying books that &#x201C;teach particular sciences, or distinct branches of knowledge&#x201D;

                            In the <title type="anthology" corresp="#MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">MS I Poetry Anthology</title>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> reverses this recommended order, by starting with the ambitious

                    <p>The anthology brings to the surface <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s identity as a British subject with family ties
                        to <placeName corresp="#NBRITAIN">North Britain</placeName>. &#x201C;The Defiance of War&#x201D; may be most persuasively understood as a poem, not about an actual threat of military invasion, but about the
                        coalescence of British identity, <placeName corresp="#NBRITAIN">North</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">South</placeName>, in defiance of the European Other

                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> must have realized that industrial progress could be credited to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> no less than to <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>. 
                        In <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>, where his relations lived, businessmen vied with <placeName corresp="#DUNDEE">Dundee</placeName> to uphold local dignity by establishing 
                        the town&#x02BC;s own steam packet company by <date when="1822">1822</date>, just in time to join the considerable steamer activity involved in the state visit by <persName corresp="#KG4">George IV</persName> to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>

                        At the same time, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> imagines <placeName corresp="#NBRITAIN">North Britain</placeName> as a preserve of preindustrial nature and history,
                            as suggested by <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="on_scotland_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="ONSCOTLAND">&#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;</title></ref>, and by poems in his second poetry anthology,

                            poignantly reveals both <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s longings for his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName>, whose business kept him away from home for long periods, 
                            and the boy&#x02BC;s joy in his father&#x02BC;s return. Two poems, <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#THENEEDLESSALARM">&#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;</title></ref> and

                            probe the uncertainties of safety in a home. A particular threat to security and happiness may lie behind an elegiac note in

                            At the same time, if these poems reveal anxieties, the poems also work to resolve such tensions.</p>
