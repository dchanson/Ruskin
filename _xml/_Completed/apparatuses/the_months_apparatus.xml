                        Since the Ruskins were traveling on the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName> <date notBefore="1835-06-02" notAfter="1835-12-10">2 June&#x2013;10 December 1835</date>, the revision was likely completed within five months, by the end of <date notBefore="1835-05-01" notAfter="1835-05-31">May 1835</date>.</p>

                    <p>For the origin of this poem in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s New Year&#x02BC;s ode for <date when="1835-01-01">1 January 1835</date>, see <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPECKHAMRYE">&#x201C;As I was walking round by Peckham rye&#x201D;</title> (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>). <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> (and/or the editors) shortened this poem from 17 stanzas to 3—taken from stanzas 12, 13, and 14 of the original draft/fair copy— essentially creating a new poem entirely. Stanzas 1&#x2013;11 were likely eliminated as more appropriate to private, occasional verse, in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> addresses <persName corresp="#JJR">his father</persName> directly and mulls over his personal ambition as a writer and the difficulty of putting life into a &#x201C;dry&#x201D; topic.
                        Stanzas 12&#x2013;14,  in contrast, were more impersonal and cohesive, requiring the least amount of editing and/or restructuring; and as argued respecting the draft, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have composed them from the start with an eye to publication (<title type="poem" corresp="#JRPECKHAMRYE">see &#x201C;As I was walking round by Peckham rye&#x201D;</title>: Composition and Publication). <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> maintained the three stanzas&#x02BC; structure  with the most notable changes reflected in punctuation and word change.
                        Typically, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> punctuated his draft and fair copy poems sparingly, while punctuation was added to the published stanzas to regulate the grammar of the poem for the public. For example, &#x201C;Marches maddened winds shall roar&#x201D; in the draft gains clarity  when edited as &#x201C;March&#x02BC;s maddenned winds, shall roar&#x201D;. In Victorian publishing, responsibility for this regularization often fell to the compositor; in this case, however, this task may have been taken by the editor, <persName corresp="#WHH">W. H. Harrison</persName>, who thus began his long association with the Ruskin family as a copyeditor of <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s writing and liaison with publishers and printers. 
                        Diction was edited for greater elegance and logic, albeit sacrificing some individuality. In the afore&#x2010;mentioned line, &#x201C;bathed by Marches&#x201D; is changed to &#x201C;lashed by March&#x02BC;s&#x201D;. The colorful but awkward &#x201C;Through all the air the reapers songs are lunging&#x201D; becomes the more conventionally poetic &#x201C;The sun&#x2010;burnt reaper&#x02BC;s jocund lays are singing&#x201D;. Just as the transition from a private audience to a public audience called for elimination of the first eleven stanzas,  the first person pronouns—excessive use of &#x201C;I&#x201D; and &#x201C;myself&#x201D; throughout the first version—gives way to third person narrative.
                        Again, the mediator of this shift appears to be the standalone piece, &#x201C;January Suggesting that, at this point in the draft, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was already thinking about a more public piece.

                    <p>As for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s personal life at the time of publication, he was involved in many educational opportunities.
                        <persName corresp="#JSD">James S. Dearden</persName>&#x02BC;s book <title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINPICTURES">John Ruskin: A Life in Pictures</title> expands upon a miniature portrait of young <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> by <persName corresp="#AECHALON">Alfred Edward Chalon</persName> in <date when="1836">1836</date>. During this time, he &#x201C;was attending the <persName corresp="#TDREV">Rev. Thomas Dale</persName>&#x02BC;s lectures on early English literature at <orgName corresp="#KINGSCOLLEGE">King&#x02BC;s College</orgName>, he was taking watercolour lessons from <persName corresp="#CFARTIST">Copley Fielding</persName> and drawing lessons from <persName corresp="#CR">Charles Runciman</persName>&#x201D; (<persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName> 27). 
                        While tackling all of these tasks, he was preparing to attend <orgName corresp="#OXFORDU">Oxford</orgName> in January of the following year. His mother accompanied him on the trip while his &#x201C;<persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName> would remain in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> or travelling the country in connection with his sherry business&#x201D; (27). <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have omitted the personal sections to his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName> in the poem because he wanted to preserve their connection separate from other influences.
