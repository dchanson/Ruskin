                <p>A loose leaf (not counted in the collation) was inserted between the title page and 1r; it holds a clipping from <ref type="bibliography" target="bibilography.php#JRPOEMS8D1891"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS8D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (8<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891)</title></ref> 
                    describing MS I, along with brief remarks possibly in the hand
                    of <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="wedderburn_note.php"><persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName></ref>. It is
                    not clear in this case whether, for this purpose, an existing notebook leaf was used (e.g.,
                    whether <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;frontispiece&#x201D; originally began on 2r,
                    following this leaf), or whether a piece of paper was trimmed to the 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Book</ref>&#x02BC;s size and inserted
                    here. The latter is more probable, since similar insertions in other Red Books 
                    (e.g., <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msiii_apparatus.php">MS III</ref>) certainly formed no part of the original notebook.</p>
                <p>Despite <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s erratic page numbering, no leaves appear to be missing,
                    except for pp. 30&#x2013;31, which cause a gap in the text. This missing leaf
                    probably included a &#x201C;plate,&#x201D; <ref type="drawing" target="D5.php">[Plate 4, &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1]</ref>.
                    The leaf containing plate 5, <ref type="drawing" target="D6.php">&#x201C;Lucy&#x02BC;s Drawing Room,&#x201D; [Plate] &#x201C;5,&#x201D; [&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1&#x201D;]</ref> (pp.
                    36&#x2013;37) was likewise torn out, although this leaf was reattached, using a
                    glued, perforated sticker (since the tear line fits the remaining stub, this
                    leaf was evidently not moved here from elsewhere). The gummed strip used to mend
                    this leaf&#x2014;resembling the border from a sheet of postage stamps&#x2014;resembles
                    one put to a similar use in proof sheets for <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)</ref> (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS70">RF MS 70</ref>). On this evidence,
                    one infers that <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="collingwood_w_g_note.php"><persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName></ref> had a hand preserving MS I, an inference
                    coincident with his preparing the first bibliography of these manuscripts, the
                    &#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS4D1891"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</title></ref>, 1:261&#x2013;67;

                <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s erratic page numbering through p. 50 probably arose from
                    his attempt to correct earlier misnumbering. Erased earlier numbering remains
                    visible starting on the present p. 21 (&#x201C;19&#x201D; is the erased
                    number, an error since p. 19 had already appeared) and continuing consecutively
                    through p. 49[<hi rend="italic">b</hi>] (i.e., the <hi rend="italic">second</hi>
                    p. 49). Since the latter was written over top of &#x201C;47,&#x201D; it
                    appears that, at about this point, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> realized an error, went back to the
                    present p. 21, and began renumbering; however, he made some new errors and
                    possibly deliberately repeated pp. 48&#x2013;49 in an attempt to bring his
                    numbering in sync with following pages. The erratic numbering after p. 50
                    appears to have resulted from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> writing &#x201C;80&#x201D; for
                    &#x201C;60,&#x201D; and carrying on without correction. The missing p. 87 is
                    probably a mere oversight.</p>

                    (see <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="mr_gloss_dating_msi_apparatus.php">Gloss on the Dating of MS I</ref>). Since she inserted her annotation toward the
                    end, within the <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php">MS I Poetry Anthology</ref>, 
                    it is probable that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> devoted approximately the <date when="1827-01">first month of 1827</date>
                    to fair&#x2010;copying the poems (and possibly also composing some of them), whereas
                    he had spent the <date notBefore="1826-09-22" notAfter="1826-12-31">fall/winter 1826</date> composing and fair&#x2010;copying

                <p>Evidence for this sequence of events is supported by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s likely mimicry of
                    his <persName corresp="#MR">mother</persName>&#x02BC;s form of dating MS I, when he dated a 1&#x2010;leaf presentation copy of

                    (see <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="the_ship_apparatus.php#DATE">&#x201C;The Ship&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">and</hi> &#x201C;Look at That Ship&#x201D; [1827]: Date</ref>). 
                    It can easily be imagined that, on this manuscript in <date notBefore="1827-02-10" notAfter="1827-02-20">mid-February 1827</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>
                    mimicked his <persName corresp="#MR">mother</persName>&#x02BC;s manner from only a few weeks earlier of dating MS I.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s annotation, depending on how one interprets it, possibly
                    suggests also that at least one of the poems, <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php">&#x201C;The Needless Alarm,&#x201D;</ref> was composed earlier than its
                    extant witness in MS I, while the rest of the poems may be dated no earlier than their
                    witnesses here (see <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php#DATE">&#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;: Date</ref>; and

                <p>Probably a few months after <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> entered her note dating the entire 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Book</ref>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> added

                    to the back inside endboard and dated the drawing <date when="1827-03-21">21 March</date>, although no year is given. This appears to establish the
                    latest date of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s work on the manuscript.</p>
                <p>Thus, in summary, while <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> probably composed or at least fair&#x2010;copied the contents of the
                    manuscript <date notBefore="1826-09" notAfter="1827-03">between September 1826 and March 1827</date>, he may have composed some of
                    the contents earlier. In particular, <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php">&#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;</ref> may date from <date notBefore="1826-01" notAfter="1826-04">early 1826</date>; and

                <p>MS I is written entirely in large penciled print, more childish than that in any other

                    was already carefully imitating published books by justifying the margins;
                    devising a title page, frontispiece, and colophon; labeling his drawings as
                    &#x201C;plates&#x201D;; and filling out the volume with the <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php">MS I Poetry Anthology</ref>, which he

                <p>MS I shows more uniform control over the entirety of its contents than tended to
                    be the case in later <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref>,
                    which grew more miscellaneous with successive uses at different times. For
                    example, the title page appears more nearly to serve for the entire manuscript than is the case in 
                    <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msiii_apparatus.php">MS III</ref> and <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msiiia_apparatus.php">MS IIIA</ref>, which likewise begin with volumes of
                    &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; but which also contain much else that is
                    altogether unrelated to the opening narrative.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, the <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php">MS I Poetry Anthology</ref>,
                    which fills out MS I, appears less haphazard than poetry miscellanies in the other Red Books. The first of
                    these poems, <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="the_steam_engine_apparatus.php">&#x201C;When furious up from mines the water pours&#x201D; [&#x201C;The Steam Engine&#x201D;]</ref>,

                    sustaining the <date notBefore="1637" notAfter="1815">Enlightenment</date>, entrepreneurial spirit of the immediately
                        preceding <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</ref>, which imitates works by associates of <persName corresp="#ED">Erasmus Darwin</persName>, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="edgeworth_maria_note.php"><persName corresp="#ME">Maria Edgeworth</persName></ref> and <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="joyce_jeremiah_note.php"><persName corresp="#JJ">Jeremiah Joyce</persName></ref>.</p>
                <p>As a visual artifact, MS I imitates the appearance of books <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would have
                    known: he modeled the title page directly on <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED">Maria Edgeworth, <hi rend="italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</hi></ref>; 
                    and in the &#x201C;plates,&#x201D; he imitated any
                    number of books in the Ruskin family library (<persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s volumes were
                    not illustrated). Most of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;plates&#x201D; bear no
                    apparent relation with the text, but the frontispiece,
                    <ref type="drawing" target="D4.php">&#x201C;Frontispiece&#x201D; [Plate] &#x201C;1&#x201D; [&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D; Vol 1]</ref>, 
                    which features &#x201C;a rainbow,&#x201D; may be
                    complemented by the last of the poems in the anthology, <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="on_the_rainbow_apparatus.php">&#x201C;On the Rainbow: In Blank Verse.&#x201D;</ref> The
                    rainbow drawing, moreover, could refer to Harry&#x02BC;s vision of the Witch of
                    the Alps at the end of <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</ref>. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> could have added the rainbow to the
                    frontispiece as an afterthought: we cannot know for certain whether the textual
                    rainbow suggested the graphic one, or vice versa, or whether the two are
                    definitely related at all. But it seems likely that he arranged the contents in
                    order to frame the book with the theme of the rainbow as both promise and
                    closure.</p>
                <p>Another sign of control over the entirety of the contents appears at the end of
                    the Red Book, on p. 106, where <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> placed a colophon:
                    &#x201C;The end / <placeName corresp="#HERNE">hernhill</placeName> / <placeName corresp="#FOUNTAINST">fountain street</placeName> / <del>end of the poems</del> / juvenile library <placeName corresp="#FOUNTAINST">fountain street</placeName>.&#x201D; The
                    colophon is followed by <ref type="drawing" target="D1.php">&#x201C;Heights of Wisdom, Depth of Fools<!--Fools or Folly?  Answer from CWB: It is "fools" in the ms.-->&#x201D; [Miscellaneous Drawing, MS I]</ref>, in
                    which the concave shape of the narrow valley appears to answer to the convex
                    form of the rainbow in the frontispiece. The colophon could be based on 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED">Maria Edgeworth, <hi rend="italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</hi></ref>, which concludes in the fourth volume with
                    &#x201C;<hi rend="smallcaps">The End.</hi>&#x201D; and, below that,
                    &#x201C;<hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>:</hi> / <hi rend="smallcaps">Printed by <persName corresp="#CW">Charles Wood</persName>,</hi> / <placeName corresp="#POPPINSCT">Poppin&#x02BC;s Court</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#FLEETST">Fleet Street</placeName>.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> evidently meant the colophon to unify the entire contents of MS I&#x2014;<ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</ref>, 
                        along with the <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php">MS I Poetry Anthology</ref>&#x2014;but the
                    deletion within the colophon of &#x201C;end of the poems&#x201D; points to how his
                    attempts at symmetry and closure were ongoing decisions. It appears that the deleted phrase originally formed part of a colophon that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> meant to apply only to the poetry anthology, 
                    but that, by deleting the phrase, he caused to refer to the entire Red Book, not just the
                    poems (reading, in effect, &#x201C;The end / <placeName corresp="#HERNE">hernhill</placeName> / <placeName corresp="#FOUNTAINST">fountain street</placeName> / juvenile library <placeName corresp="#FOUNTAINST">fountain street</placeName>&#x201D;). Another, slightly different scenario is possible: the fact that the final two
                    poems of the anthology fall after <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s annotation dating the whole of
                    MS I may indicate that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> added these poems (on pp.
                    103&#x2013;6) after his <persName corresp="#MR">mother</persName>&#x02BC;s dating, and as he did so, he deleted &#x201C;end of
                    the poems&#x201D; on p. 106 so as not to belie his addition. But this possibility seems contradicted by the placement of the colophon following all of the poems. 
                    It is also possible, of course, whatever the scenario, that the deletion was not made by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, but by someone
                    else.</p>

                    reviewed his juvenilia for those later autobiographical writings. Unfortunately,
