                    <p>While <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s fragment lacks clues to the specific occasion that he was transcribing or summarizing, 
                        one can connect the piece generally with the stir of interest in missionary work that arose in the Ruskins&#x02BC; environment of worship 
                        during the <date notBefore="1825" notAfter="1829">second half of the 1820s</date>, and specifically with arguments for <hi rend="italic">Christian liberality</hi> in support of foreign missions.</p>

                            the fragment of argument transcribed by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> corresponds to the sentiments, if not specific language and examples, of an essay 
                            in the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="evangelical_magazine_note.php"><title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title></ref>, 
                            <title type="essay" corresp="#ANONLIBERALITYEVANGELICALMAG1829-05">&#x201C;The Question of Liberality Considered in Reference to Missions and Other Christian Efforts&#x201D;</title>. Published in the <date when="1829-05">May 1829</date> issue, 
                            its date makes a good fit with a terminus ad quem for <title type="essay" corresp="#JRATHEME">&#x201C;a theme&#x201D;</title> based on the position of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s piece in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title>, 
                            particularly if the magazine essay originated in a sermon or lecture that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> might have heard a month or two earlier. 
                            Regardless of whether this published essay had any specific connection with the origin of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s transcript, however, 
                            its argument and context may help to illuminate the circumstances surrounding what <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> heard.</p>
                            
                        <p>The subtitle of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> essay describes its purpose: 
                            &#x201C;An attempt to ascertain what Classes of Professing <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christians</orgName> are most defective in liberality towards the cause of Evangelical Religion, both at Home and Abroad&#x201D;. 
                            The audience is the &#x201C;church of <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#CREATOR">God</persName>&#x201D;, and the <orgName corresp="#LMS">London Missionary Society (LMS)</orgName> in particular, which has taken on &#x201C;nothing less 
                            <hi rend="italic">than the conversion of the whole world to <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#CREATOR">God</persName></hi>&#x201D;. The writer believes that the <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christian</orgName> liberality on which this enormous mission depends is 
                            &#x201C;but imperfectly understood, and but partially felt&#x201D; if the <orgName corresp="#LMS">LMS</orgName> congratulates itself on having raised forty&#x2010;six thousand pounds in the previous year&#x2014;a sum that 
                            may seem munificent compared to collections prior to the cause of foreign missions, but that is paltry compared to the goal that the (British) church has now set for itself. 
                            The moral danger of underestimating both the challenges of the missions and their cost is a &#x201C;prone[ness] to set up wrong standards of duty, and to make ill&#x2010;established comparisons of conduct, 
                            and thus to flatter ourselves into groundless conceits of our high attainments in moral excellence&#x201D;. Rhetorically, then, the speaker poses both as an &#x201C;expostulating friend&#x201D; 
                            against the &#x201C;unbelief and selfishness&#x201D; of the &#x201C;Classes of Professing <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christians</orgName>&#x201D; who are &#x201C;defective in liberality&#x201D; and as a skeptical agent who is not dazzled into complacency by seeming success (pp. 180&#x2013;81, 184&#x2013;85). 
                            The speaker recorded by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> targets comparatively vulnerable classes in theater&#x2010;goers and trinket buyers, 
                            and the speaker even falters when invoking the enormity of the charitable goal, but the rhetorical structure of the talk that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> heard presumably was similar to this essay. 
                            Such arguments formed a context of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s later rhetorical exaggerations in <title type="essay" corresp="#JRNATUREOFGOTHIC">&#x201C;The Nature of Gothic&#x201D;</title> in which he compares ladies who buy glass beads to slave drivers.</p>
                        
                        <p>In a similar fashion, the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> essay proceeds to identify groups who fail in Christian liberality. 
                            First to be called out are &#x201C;our more wealthy ministers&#x201D;, hypocrites who hoard their own wealth while urging their congregations to philanthropy. The next classification would have struck the Ruskins as closer to home&#x2014;the 
                            the secular &#x201C;rich&#x201D;, specifically &#x201C;the men who have either retired from business with their comfortable competency of one, two, or three thousand a year and upwards; 
                            or who are still in trade with an income of the same amount&#x201D;. Rich men in these circumstances, the writer supposes, annually allow perhaps a total of thirty pounds to 
                            &#x201C;the cause of religion generally, both at home and abroad&#x201D;, an amount the writer considers the least &#x201C;they ought to contribute to the cause of Missions alone&#x201D; (pp. 182&#x2013;83). 
                            By this standard, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> was generous, effectively tithing a tenth of his income. In <date when="1829">1829</date>, to sample just that year, he received &#x00A3;3853 in income from his firm plus a few hundred pounds from other sources, 
                            while he logged &#x00A3;229 in &#x201C;Charity &#x0026; Gifts&#x201D; as well as &#x00A3;135 to support three of his nieces and nephews orphaned by the death of his sister and &#x00A3;38 to help <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s relations. 
                            <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s abbreviated notes make it difficult to sort the donations precisely among religious, secular, and family causes, but all three categories 
                            are certainly represented. The various &#x201C;church&#x201D; and &#x201C;Bible&#x201D; donations include &#x00A3;50 for &#x201C;orphans&#x201D; paid to the family&#x02BC;s clergyman, <persName corresp="#EA">Edward Andrews</persName>, 
                            but how much, if any, went to foreign missions in this year is obscure (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28">Account Book</ref>, 15r, 13r, 13v).</p>
                        
                        <p>The remaining classes named in the essay as failing to give their share are &#x201C;the <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christians</orgName> who inhabit small towns and villages&#x201D;, 
                            the fault lying in part with the &#x201C;great public institutions of the age&#x201D; habitually looking to the metropolis for support, but also 
                            with village dwellers who &#x201C;have never seriously considered their obligations to the cause of <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName> at large&#x201D; (p. 183).

                            Finally, the writer is stern with &#x201C;young persons, who, though they live with their parents, possess a separate income at their own disposal&#x201D;, yet substitute their parents&#x02BC; benevolence 
                            for their own (p. 184). For years to come, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> relied on his father for charities that <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> did not necessarily approve, but <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> controlled no income of his own until after his father&#x02BC;s death.
