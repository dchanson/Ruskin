                            (<date when="1816">1816</date>) by <persName corresp="#FDH">Felicia Hemans</persName>, which commemorates the return of artworks that French Revolutionary forces had taken 
                            from <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> and installed in the <placeName type="building" corresp="#LOUVRE">Louvre</placeName>. Lexical evidence in Ruskin's borrowings from <persName corresp="#FDH">Hemans</persName>'s poem 
                            prove that he read the second, lengthier edition of the poem, published by <orgName corresp="#MURRAY">John Murray</orgName> in the same year, 1816, as the first edition 
                            (for details, see contextual glosses in the texts).</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>&#x02BC;s agents began confiscating artworks in Italy in <date when="1797">1797</date> 
                            for installation in the Palace of the Louvre, already declared a museum for public access to the French royal collection, and later to be renamed the Mus&#x00E9;e Napol&#x00E9;on. 
                            As Martin Rosenberg explains, Napoleon craved possession of acknowledged masterpieces of art, because their status awarded him the prestige and legitimacy of patron-rulers 
                            from Charlemagne to Louis XIV. Especially significant were the classical statues confiscated from the Vatican 
                            on terms conceded by the pope in the Treaty of Tolentino (1797). The spoils of classical sculpture not only enabled Napoleon to pattern 
                            his conquest on the plundering of Athens's treasures by the Roman general Sulla, as recounted by Plutarch; 
                            control over these works also enshrined his regime in the cultural significance that Enlightenment thinkers like Johann Winckelmann 
                            had conferred on such exemplary works as the Apollo Belvedere. Thus, Paris became the "new Rome" in both an imperial and cultural sense 
                            (Rosenberg, Raphael's Transfiguration and Napoleon's Cultural Politics, 180-85).</p>
                        <p>The classical sculptures were marched into the Louvre in a public triumphal procession on 27 July 1798. 
                            Carried immediately behind the Apollo Belvedere and Laocoon was the Transfiguration, the last painting completed by Raphael before his death. 
                            For the French Academy, Raphael's work represented the continuity of the classical tradition and authorization modern neoclassicism. 
                            His style seemed to condense the tradition from the ancients to Leonardo and Michelangelo, and re-present that heritage as a set of teachable rules, 
                            which for the Academy epitomized "a model of invention, design, and expression"--the methods of the "'exemplary history painter'" 
                            (Rosenberg, Raphael's Transfiguration and Napoleon's Cultural Politics, 186, 191-96).</p>
                        <!-- MAYBE NEW TAGGING MIXED WITH OLD NOW--><p>After <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>&#x02BC;s defeat, artworks began to be restored to their prewar origins in <date notBefore="1815" notAfter="1816">1815&#x2013;16</date>. 
                            <persName corresp="#FDH">Hemans</persName> traces the homecomings, combining ekphrastic description of the works with celebration of the Italian cities that welcomed them home.

                            reinstated in the <placeName corresp="#VATICAN">Vatican</placeName>. <persName corresp="#FDH">Hemans</persName> concludes with the restoration of Italian Renaissance paintings,

                        and that therefore <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s commission for <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title>
                        must have been associated with his family&#x02BC;s visit to <placeName corresp="#SALZBURG">Salzburg</placeName>

                        This alleged timing of the commission would have been impossible, however, given that the poem must have been submitted for publication one year earlier than this journey,
                        in order to be included in <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering . . . for MDCCCXXXV</hi></title>,

                        The poem was composed in response, not to nature, but to the print culture of illustrated travel writing of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>.
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, like many other contributors to the literary annuals,
                        had no personal experience of the place that his persona pretended to traverse; instead, his informaton about the place was drawn from printed sources,
                        while his creative response was primarily ekphrastic, an engagement with the engraving of the foreign scene

                    <p>While <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> was certainly wrong about the <date when="1835">late 1835</date> date of this commission, his speculation about the circumstances of the assignment bear inquiry.
                        He assumes a casual happenstance, under pressure of a deadline: &#x201C;It happened that <persName corresp="#TP">Mr. Pringle</persName> had a plate of <placeName corresp="#SALZBURG">Salzburg</placeName>
                        which he wanted to print in order to make up the volume of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> for the next Christmas&#x201D;

                        It is credible that <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s regard for the Ruskin family and his genuine appreciation of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s abilities
                        prompted him to solicit, for the same volume of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> containing <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title>,

                        <!-- START TAGGING -->It seems an extraordinary undertaking, however, to have appointed a fifteen&#x2010;year&#x2010;old first&#x2010;time contributor to compose a text so prominent,
                        as a poem to explain one of the eleven embellishments&#x2014;for many readers, the main features of an annual. <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s assumption that the assignment of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title> was a rush job
                        is disproven by the probable <date notBefore="1834-04" notAfter="1834-05">April&#x2010;May 1834</date> date of the poem&#x02BC;s draft, as well as by the many differences between the draft and publsihed version, which indicate ample time for revision.
                        Also, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s neophyte status made him an unusual choice, <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> having previously appointed mainly experienced hands to supply letterpress for plates.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s commissioning of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to compose an ekphrastic verse accompaniment to <persName corresp="#WPPURSER">Purser</persName>&#x02BC;s engraving was, therefore, thoughtfully planned and deliberate;
                            and the appointment of so young a contributor for such an important role was rare, and possibly unprecedented under <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s editorship.
                            The editing must have entailed considerable effort, for while the presence of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand in the draft of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title>

                            All of this points to a considerable act of mentorship on <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s part, which he put forth on top of editing

                            which occupied a prominent place in the volume. If any truth lies in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s comment on <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s mentorship, written decades later,

                        Consisting of a prose preface and a poem, the piece fills the page facing the engraving with an extract about the town from a travelogue,

                        as if <persName corresp="#DW">Dorothy Wordsworth</persName> had composed a secondary <title type="poem" corresp="#WORDSWORTHTINTERNABBEY">&#x201C;Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey, on Revisiting the Banks of the Wye&#x201D;</title>;
                        and the poem moves on from the prospect to dwell on indebtedness and friendship, themes that define the literary annual.
                        &#x201C;So rose the scene on <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC; classic eye&#x201D;,
                        the final section begins, reverting to the prose preface and shared journal entry, and the section concludes with a declaration that the act of sharing testifies to one
                        &#x201C;Whom &#x02BC;tis a pride and grace to call my Friend&#x201D;. Between these testimonials, <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> negotiates
                        his position in this friendship, which is unequal. While his speaker has adopted <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x201C;s viewpoint,
                        <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s speaker confessedly has not visited <placeName corresp="#SPOLETO">Spoleto</placeName>; and viewing only its picture, this poet/speaker can produce only secondary prospect lyric, like secondary epic.
                        Even if he did on some &#x201C;reflective summer&#x02BC;s day&#x201D; stretch his person before the scene, <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> modestly denies his the capacity to measure up to it,
                        suggesting that he lacks <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;classic eye&#x201D;. For had <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> made use of his journal entry, &#x201C;[h]ad <hi rend="italic">he</hi> to verse transferred it [the scene] from his mind&#x201D;,
                        the &#x201C;touching image&#x201D; would have been &#x201C;enshrined&#x201D; and &#x201C;embalmed in words that could ne&#x201C;er die&#x201D;.
                        whereas &#x201C;Far other fate awaits this rustic lay, / Framed for the passing purpose of a day&#x201D;. In <title type="poem" corresp="#PRINGLESPOLETO">&#x201C;Spoleto&#x201D;</title>,
                        <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> transforms the workaday letterpress for a landscape print into an occasion for demonstrating the literary annual&#x02BC;s purpose of cultivating memory and fellow&#x2010;feeling;
                        however, he also maintains the neoclassical ordering of the arts, subordinating <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>
                        and his own &#x201C;rustic lay&#x201D; to <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;classic&#x201D; verse

                        <p>In this deferential conception of the annual&#x02BC;s place in literary and artistic culture,
                            we perhaps can glimpse the <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s expectations when he arranged to usher his prodigy into the <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s august preence,

                            on those amiable and shining pages&#x201D;. The characterization of amiability and friendship is tied to the annual itself,
                            while a hierarchical rigidity is associated with <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> and his &#x201C;cross&#x2010;examination&#x201D; of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s presence, resulting in a rebuke of the boy

The characterization is consistent with the unequal friendship between poets represented in <title type="poem" corresp="#PRINGLESPOLETO">Spoleto</title>,
                        and with <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s estimation of the literary annual as &#x201C;amiable&#x201D; but humble. Presumably, this would have been <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s expectation also

                        as chose <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in spite of the youth&#x02BC;s lack of professional experience,
                        in part because the editor was impressed by the youth&#x02BC;s ability to match words with pictures, but also because behind the scene he could dedicate the assignment as an act of friendship.
                        Four years later, when Pringle had another plate by Purser, Saltzburg, to assign to a writer for the upcoming volume for 1835,
                        he chose Ruskin in spite of the youth's lack of professional experience,
                        in part because the editor was impressed by the youth's ability to match words with pictures, but also because behind the scene he could dedicate the assignment as an act of friendship.
                        Since it was at about this time that Pringle arranged for Ruskin to be introduced to Samuel Rogers,
                        and escorted him to Rogers's St. James Place residence
                        (Hanson, Ruskin in the 1830s, 000; Samuel Rogers),
                        it is more probable that Pringle would have invested the "Saltzburg" commission with greater significance than the mere happenstance that W. G. Collingwood supposes, that
                        "[i]t happened that Mr. Pringle had a plate of Salzburg which he wanted to print in order to make up the volume of Friendship's Offering for the next Christmas"
                        (Life and Work of John Ruskin, 1:52). Rather, in conferring such an impressive commission on a fifteen-year-old first-time contributor,
                        Pringle would have shown his regard for the Ruskin family, and formalized his role of mentor and friend to the young poet, just as Rogers had condescended to Pringle.
                        A tribute to an elder and greater poet occupies the entirety of Pringle's conclusion of his poem on Spoleto, framing the ekphrasis
                        as an offering to a lasting poet from the pages of an ephemeral publication, "Framed for the passing purpose of a day" in the calendar of an annual, by a "rustic" Scots poet:</p>
                    <p>About four years later, when <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> had another plate by <persName corresp="#WPPAINTER">Purser</persName>,

                        one can only speculate whether, in bestowing that significant opportunity on a (practically) unpublished fifteen-year old, he imagined himself replicating
                        the patronage by the senior man of letters that. If so, did Pringle cast Ruskin as the lesser talent, or merely less experienced?
                        The one certainty is that Pringle premised his bid for the reader's friendship on his humility. The conclusion to <title type="poem" corresp="#PRINGLESPOLETO">&#x201C;Spoleto&#x201D;</title>,
                        consists of an offering to a lasting poet from the pages of an ephemeral publication, &#x201C;Framed for the passing purpose of a day&#x201D; in the calendar of an annual, by a &#x201C;rustic&#x201D; Scots poet:</p>
