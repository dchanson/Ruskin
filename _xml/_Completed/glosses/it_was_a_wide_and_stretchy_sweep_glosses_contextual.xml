                    which encircled the interior of the building&#x02BC;s dome, but the subordinate exhibits, which surrounded the building on its perimeter. By the time of the

                    had begun encircling the structure with pleasure gardens, which contained a bewildering variety of attractions, amongst which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                    singled out these seemingly random objects.</p>
                    
                    <p>The crocodile stools are explained by an <date when="1829">1829</date> aquatint by the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann firm</orgName>,

                        The scene in the print opens out to a large fountain from inside a &#x201C;treillage pavilion&#x201D; designed in the manner of <persName corresp="#HR">Humphry Repton</persName>. 
                        This pavilion apparently was never built at the <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName>, but the aquatint includes a garden seat fancifully 
                        speared by a reptile, its head protruding from one end, its tail curling outward from the other end, and its legs forming the stool&#x02BC;s frame. With unconscious irony, 
                        the print&#x02BC;s caption highlights the heterogeneous mixing of styles and objects: the scene &#x201C;represents the south side of the grounds which surround the building, 
                        embracing a picturesque trait of the beautiful union of Greek Architecture, thus judiciously combining with plants and flowering shrubs. The view is taken from the 
                        Corridor or covered way, leading from the interior of the structure [the trellised pavilion] to the first Fountain, whose refreshing showers are felt delightfully cooling 
                        after the ascent to the Gallery of the <title type="artwork" corresp="#HORNORSLONDONPANORAMA">Panorama</title>, 
                        and the circuit of the Pavilion enriched with so great a treasury of art. This enchanting spot leads through delightful alleys formed by extensive greenhouses, 
                        abounding in all the richest productions of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FLORA">Flora</persName>, from almost every region, to the <placeName type="building" corresp="#SWISSCOTTAGECOLOSSEUM">Swiss Farm&#x2010;House</placeName>,

                        which it is intended to describe. This part of the great scheme, when completed, it is believed, will amount to an illusion, having been prepared 
                        with rare skill and at a vast expense&#x201D;. Thus, the print&#x02BC;s caption leads the viewer from the crocodile stools shown in the print&#x02BC;s foreground

                    book 21, chapters 35&#x2013;37, <persName corresp="#LIVY">Livy</persName> relates that <persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName>&#x02BC;s army reached the summit 
                    of an <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alpine</geogName> pass having suffered great losses in the climb upward. <persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName> encouraged 
                    the men by leading them to an eminence from which they could survey the plains of <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> below. Yet the descent threatened to become 
                    even more treacherous than the ascent, since wintry weather had rendered the barren ground slippery with snow and ice, which the pack animals made worse by trampling 
                    into a slurry. At this crisis, the army advanced by using a technology that, while crude, would have evoked a modern parallel for post&#x2010;Napoleonic readers,

                    <p><quote>At length, after the men and beasts of burden had been fatigued to no purpose, the camp was pitched on the summit, the ground being cleared for that purpose 
                        with great difficulty, so much snow was there to be dug out and carried away. The soldiers being then set to make a way down the cliff, 
                        by which alone a passage could be effected, and it being necessary that they should cut through the rocks, having felled and lopped a number of large trees 
                        which grew around, they make a huge pile of timber; and as soon as a strong wind fit for exciting the flames arose, they set fire to it, and, 
                        pouring vinegar on the heated stones, they render them soft and crumbling. They then open a way with iron instruments through the rock thus heated by the fire, 
                        and soften its declivities by gentle windings, so that not only the beasts of burden, but also the elephants could be led down it. Four days were spent 
                        about this rock, the beasts nearly perishing through hunger: for the summits of the mountains are for the most part bare, and if there is any pasture the snows bury it. 
                        The lower parts contain valleys, and some sunny hills, and rivulets flowing beside woods, and scenes more worthy of the abode of man. 
                        There the beasts of burden were sent out to pasture, and rest given for three days to the men, fatigued with forming the passage: 
                        they then descended into the plains, the country and the dispositions of the inhabitants being now less rugged.</quote></p>
