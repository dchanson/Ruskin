                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> also adds a &#x201c;frontispiece&#x201d; and &#x201c;plates&#x201d; to his imitation of <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02bc;s text,

                    In the transcription, end&#x2010;of&#x2010;line horizontal marks that are not notated as justification marks are hyphens connecting syllables of words broken between lines, 
                    as will be evident where they occur. Occasionally, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drops word&#x2010;break hyphens to the beginning of the line that follows the word division. 
                    More often, he breaks words without using a hyphen at all.</p></note>

                    More or less correct usage of commas&#x2014;at least, in the middle of sentences, rather than at the end&#x2014;remains rare

                    Since the tear line fits the remaining stub, the leaf evidently was not moved here from elsewhere. 
                    Gummed strips can be found put to a similar use in <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G.

                    the plate numbering suggests that the missing leaf contained a plate, numbered plate 4. An alternative explanation is suggested 
                    by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s having left p. 25 blank, the verso of which contains plate 3, 
                    raising the possibility that he meant to add a plate to this space, which would have been numbered plate 4.</p></note>

                    may be meant as a justification mark, but the function of the (upside&#x2010;down) caret can only be guessed. Possibly, having stretched out the word 
                    <hi rend="italic">Presently</hi> using a justification mark to fill the line, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> felt he needed to tie the suffix securely to the base word.</p></note>

                    after the centered &#x201c;chap 7&#x201d; heading was already in place. Since the insertion is necessary to complete the dependent clause begun on the line above, 
                    and not an afterthought extending the sentence, it serves as evidence that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> fair&#x2010;copied the text in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title> from a draft (not extant). Only an omission

                <note xml:id="PAGE88" resp="#DCH"><p><hi rend="bold">Page number 88 (MS I)&#x2014;</hi><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> misnumbers this page as &#x201C;88&#x201D;, which should be &#x201C;87&#x201D; as the verso of &#x201C;86&#x201D;. 
                    Like the previoius misnumbering of &#x201C;80&#x201D; for what should have been &#x201C;60&#x201D;, the error affects the page&#x2010;numbering sequence 
                    for the remainder of the manuscript. The number &#x201C;9&#x201D; to the left of &#x201C;88&#x201D; perhaps reveals <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s 
                    awareness that something was wrong; if so, he attempted to correct the error in the wrong direction.</p></note>
                
                <note xml:id="SEGUE" resp="#DCH"><p><hi rend="bold">Page number 80 (MS I)&#x2014;</hi>Although Ruskin returned Harry and Lucy 
                    from Joyce's pneumatics experiments to the seaside setting little more than one page earlier, he makes an abrupt segue from the unannounced 
                    arrival of a guest at the hotel back to Joyce's text. The abrupt shift in topic is marked by a possible change in handwriting, 
                    not in lettering style or medium, but in control: from here to the end of the chapter, the letters seem smaller and the strokes more assured. 
                    The combined evidence may indicate that some time elapsed between Ruskin's writing about the new arrival at the hotel and inventing his conclusion.</p></note>
