                                <p>I could not help feeling now, and I felt it still more when I began to attempt to commit the prospect to paper, 
                                    that the awe and wonder which I experienced were of a very complex character,
                                    and greatly detached from the simple act of vision. The eye is, by itself, and without some objects to
                                    form a comparison, unable to judge of such heights at such a distance. [The Welsh mountains]

                                    good a picture as the mountains now before me; and the reason that I am so much more impressed 
                                    with the present view, is partly the mysterious idea of aweful and inaccessible remoteness attached 
                                    to the Indian <placeName corresp="#CAUCASUS">Caucasus</placeName>, the centre of earth, &#x201C;Its Altar, and its Cradle, and its Throne&#x201D;, 
                                    and still more the knowledge derived from books that the objects now before me are really among

                    but digs at <placeName corresp="#HERCULANEUM">Herculaneum</placeName> were renewed in <date when="1828">1828</date>, and extended through the period of the composition, revision, and publication 
                    of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem. Earlier excavations at <placeName corresp="#HERCULANEUM">Herculaneum</placeName> had consisted mainly in tunneling, removing antiquities, and backfilling, so that there was little 
                    to be seen of the city structures apart from the amphitheater. The renewed excavations were aimed at laying bare structures and spaces 
                    such as what tourists were accustomed to viewing at <placeName corresp="#POMPEII">Pompeii</placeName>. Thus, in <date notBefore="1829" notAfter="1830">1829&#x2013;30</date>, <placeName corresp="#HERCULANEUM">Herculaneum</placeName> was prominent in the news; 
                    and since the reference to the site occurs only in lines added to the <date when="1830">1830</date> <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title> version of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, 
                    the idea probably originated with <persName corresp="#EA">Edward Andrews</persName>, who as a classicist would have been interested in the antiquities, which included a library of papyrus rolls 
                    found at <placeName corresp="#HERCULANEUM">Herculaneum</placeName>, raising hopes of finding lost classical texts.</p>
                    
                    <p>In English literature, these treasures, along with the imagined drama of the disaster that buried the cities, were themes of poems 
                        about <placeName corresp="#HERCULANEUM">Herculaneum</placeName> written in the <date notBefore="1700" notAfter="1835">eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries</date>, including one by <persName corresp="#WW">Wordsworth</persName>. In particular, 
                        the apocalyptic light surrounding the reference in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem probably reflects popular narratives of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date> that 
                    invented a Christian community living in <placeName corresp="#HERCULANEUM">Herculaneum</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#POMPEII">Pompeii</placeName> at the time of the disaster. According to these stories, 
                    a Christian sect imbued with the &#x201C;purity&#x201D; of the primitive church was rescued from the Vesuvian punishment 
                    meted out to the pagan civilization for its decadence and stubborn refusal of the Christian call. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem was too early to have been influenced 
                    by the most popularly succcessful of these narratives, <title type="book" corresp="#BULWERLYTTONLASTDAYSOFPOMPEII"><hi rend="italic">The Last Days of Pompeii</hi></title> by <persName corresp="#EBL">Edward Bulwer&#x2010;Lytton</persName>, 
                    which the Ruskins probably acquired in the first year of its publication, <date when="1834">1834</date>, but predecessors to the novel advanced the Christian theme. 
                    In one form, romances pretended to be derived from the charred scrolls discovered at <placeName corresp="#HERCULANEUM">Herculaneum</placeName>. A tale in this genre was authored later in the <date notBefore="1835" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>
