                                <p>I could not help feeling now, and I felt it still more when I began to attempt to commit the prospect to paper, 
                                    that the awe and wonder which I experienced were of a very complex character,
                                    and greatly detached from the simple act of vision. The eye is, by itself, and without some objects to
                                    form a comparison, unable to judge of such heights at such a distance. [The Welsh mountains]

                                    good a picture as the mountains now before me; and the reason that I am so much more impressed 
                                    with the present view, is partly the mysterious idea of aweful and inaccessible remoteness attached

                    Roman city, destroyed by an eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D. Excavations of the city along with Pompeii started in the early eighteenth century, 
                    but digs at Herculaneum were renewed in 1828, and extended through the period of the composition, revision, and publication 
                    of Ruskin's poem. Earlier excavations at Herculaneum had consisted mainly in tunneling, removing antiquities, and backfilling, so that there was little 
                    to be seen of the city structures apart from the amphitheater. The renewed excavations were aimed at laying bare structures and spaces 
                    such as what tourists were accustomed to viewing at Pompeii. Thus, in 1829-30, Herculaneum was prominent in the news; 
                    and since the reference to the site occurs only in lines added to the 1830 Spiritual Times version of Ruskin's poem, 
                    the idea probably originated with Edward Andrews, who as a classicist would have been interested in the antiquities, which included a library of papyrus rolls 
                    found at Herculaneum, raising hopes of finding lost classical texts.</p>
                    
                    <p>In English literature, these treasures, along with the imagined drama of the disaster that buried the cities, were themes of poems 
                        about Herculaneum written in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, including one by Wordsworth. In particular, 
                        the apocalyptic light surrounding the reference in Ruskin's poem probably reflects popular narratives of the 1830s that 
                    invented a Christian community living in Herculaneum and Pompeii at the time of the disaster. According to these stories, 
                    a Christian sect imbued with the "purity" of the primitive church was rescued from the Vesuvian punishment 
                    meted out to the pagan civilization for its decadence and stubborn refusal of the Christian call. Ruskin's poem waw too early to have been influened 
                    by the most popularly succcessful of these narratives, The Last Days of Pompeii by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 
                    which the Ruskins probably acquired in the first year of its publication, 1834, but predecessors to the novel advanced the Christian theme. 
                    In one form, romances pretended to be derived from the charred scrolls discovered at Herculaneum. A tale in this genre was authored later in the 1830s 
                    by the Reverend George Croly, who mentored Ruskin as a rising young author. On the archaeology and literary response to Herculaneum, see
