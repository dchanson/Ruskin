                    <date when="1833-06-14">14 June 1833</date> at six o&#x02BC;clock in the morning, the Ruskins left <placeName corresp="#CHIAVENNA">Chiavenna</placeName> 
                    for their first excursion on the Italian lakes. The little bay, which was the point of embarkation, refers, not to <geogName corresp="LAKECOMO">Lago di Como</geogName> 
                    which is the main subject of the poem, but to what <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName> describes as &#x201C;the lake of Chiavenna which joins that of Como&#x201D;&#x2014;that is, 
                    <geogName corresp="#LAGOMEZZOLA">Lago Mezzola</geogName>. <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>&#x02BC;s guidebook names the lake 
                    &#x201C;<geogName corresp="#LAGOMEZZOLA">Lago Mezzola</geogName>, called also <geogName corresp="#LAGORIVA">Lago di Riva</geogName>&#x201D;, 
                    and <persName corresp="#MSA">Starke</persName>&#x02BC;s guidebook calls it simply &#x201C;<geogName corresp="#LAGORIVA">La Riva</geogName>&#x201D; 
                    (i.e., <hi rend="italic">lakeshore</hi>), a term <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> also uses. Describing the journey

                    <p>The Ruskins&#x02BC; carriage having been loaded on a large boat bound for the town of <placeName corresp="#COMO">Como</placeName>, the family took a passenger boat, 
                        rowing down <geogName corresp="#LAGOMEZZOLA">Lago Mezzola</geogName>, &#x201C;none but Italians with us . . . , <persName corresp="#SALVADOR">Salvatore</persName> having gone with the carriage&#x201D;. 
                    At <placeName corresp="#DOMASO">Domaso</placeName>, a village at the north end of <geogName corresp="#LAKECOMO">Lake Como</geogName>, 
                        the family transferred to a steamer to carry them down the length of the lake, <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> 
                        enthusing about the scenery presenting a different view every moment. By four o&#x02BC;clock in the afternoon, they reached <placeName corresp="#CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</placeName>, 
                    a town on the west bank at the top of the western &#x201C;leg&#x201D; of the lake, opposite <placeName corresp="#BELLAGIO">Bellagio</placeName>; 
                    and since the steamer did not stop there, they took a small boat to <placeName corresp="#CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</placeName>, which they made their base for the weekend 
                    before traveling on to <placeName corresp="#COMO">Como</placeName> at the start of the next week 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson</title>, <date when="1833">1833</date></ref>, 42).</p>
                    
                    <p>These movements are in keeping with the recommendations of the guidebooks. <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName> cautioned travelers against pausing on their journey through these lakes, 
                        particularly &#x201C;the lower valley of the <geogName corresp="#MERA">Meira</geogName>&#x201D; (or <geogName corresp="#MERA">Mera River</geogName>), 
                        which connects &#x201C;<placeName corresp="#CHIAVENNA">Chiavenna</placeName> to the <geogName corresp="#LAGORIVA">Lago di Riva</geogName>&#x201D; 
                        (i.e., <geogName corresp="#LAGOMEZZOLA">Lago di Mezzola</geogName>) and then continues onward to connect the latter to <geogName corresp="LAKECOMO">Lago di Como</geogName>. 
                        Travelers should push onward, <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName> urged, until reaching either <placeName corresp="#BELLAGIO">Bellagio</placeName> on the promontory 
                        dividing the lower legs of <persName corresp="LAKECOMO">Lago di Como</persName>, or <placeName corresp="#CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</placeName> on the west shore, 
                        or <placeName corresp="#VARENNA">Varenna</placeName> on the east shore. Until travelers reached those points south, <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName> 
                        sternly lectured, they risked contracting malaria: &#x201C;the stranger who neglects this warning may pay for his temerity by a fever&#x201D; since 
                        &#x201C;stopping for the night [anywhere] near the embouchure of a river, where it empties itself into a lake&#x201D;, exposes the traveler to &#x201C;the morasses 
                        and flat land created by the deposits of the river&#x201D;, which &#x201C;are the hotbeds of malaria, and inevitably teem with disease&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book for Travellers in Switzerland</hi></title></ref>, 212, xxiii). 
                        <persName corresp="#MSA">Mariana Starke</persName>, in her guidebook, confirms a lesser detail in <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName>&#x02BC;s account&#x2014;that a separate boat 
                        conveyed the family&#x02BC;s carriage from <geogName corresp="#LAGORIVA">Lago di Riva</geogName> to <placeName corresp="#COMO">Como</placeName>, 
                        while the family took a small passenger boat, until joining a steamer at <placeName corresp="#DOMASO">Domaso</placeName>. <persName corresp="#MSA">Starke</persName> mentions 
                        that the steamer concession at <placeName corresp="#DOMASO">Domaso</placeName> was &#x201C;managed by Englishmen&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#STARKETRAVELSINEUROPE"><persName corresp="#MSA">Starke</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#STARKETRAVELSINEUROPE"><hi rend="italic">Travels in Europe</hi></title></ref>, 568).</p>
                    
                    <p>Note that, in the poem, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> does not mention the steamer, describing only the splash of oars in the water 
                        of <geogName corresp="LAKECOMO">Lago di Como</geogName>. By confining his description to the gentle sounds of the excursion on the smaller passenger boats, 
                        he was erasing such signs of modernity as the noisy steam packet for the sake of maintaining the picturesque, 
                        just as in the poem <title type="composite" corresp="#JRCALAISCOMP">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</title> he replaces 
                        the &#x201C;french steamer&#x201D; on the horizon with the picturesque, lugubrious movements nearby of French fishing boats.</p>
                    
                    <p>As detailed in the textual notes to this poem, <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> omitted the first ten lines of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft 
                        from the version of the poem in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)</title>, an omission that effectively erases the prelude 
                        describing <geogName corresp="#LAGOMEZZOLA">Lago Mezzola</geogName> and focuses the poem on <geogName corresp="#LAKECOMO">Lago di Como</geogName>. With this omission, 
                        <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> blunted the strategy of the poem, which contrasts the severe character of <geogName corresp="#LAGOMEZZOLA">Lago Mezzola</geogName> 
                        with the blue breadth of <geogName corresp="#LAKECOMO">Como</geogName> and its richly vegetated banks.</p></note>

                    where the narrator mentions having &#x201C;launched from below / The shade of the tall cliffs&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                    comments on the enclosed feeling of <geogName corresp="#LAGOMEZZOLA">Lago Mezzola</geogName>, compared with the breadth of <geogName corresp="LAKECOMO">Lago di Como</geogName>, 
                    which "rolled his breast of flame&#x201D; (line 20). Mary considered the smaller lake "rather gloomy" "with the mountains coming down close to the water" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson</title>, <date when="1833">1833</date></ref>, 42). 
                    In <date when="1833">1833</date>, the mountainous shore of <geogName corresp="#LAGOMEZZOLA">Lago Mezzola</geogName> perhaps appeared even more dramatic, 
                    since the perimeter of the lake was not as yet recessed by a road, which <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName> says was opened in <date when="1835">1835</date>. 
                    Even then, <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName> comments on the &#x201C;naked and savage mountains around [which] have a very peculiar outline. 
                    Their sides are furrowed with ravines, down which furious torrents precipitate themselves . . . , strewing the margin of the lake with wreck&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book for Travellers in Switzerland</hi></title></ref>, 212). 
                    These torrents must be what <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> means by a &#x201C;thousand mountain rills&#x201D;.</p></note>
