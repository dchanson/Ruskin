                    editors of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> felt justified in naming this section of prose and verse

                    which would have indicated their responsibility for the title. 
                    Their reasoning, presumably, was that <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> had already published the poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHERHINE">&#x201C;The Rhine&#x201D;</title>

                    with the poem&#x02BC;s title as found in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>; and the prose essay drafted in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>,

                    although untitled, surely must have been intended to be associated with that poem, since its related topic is announced in the first sentence. The association, however, is problematic.</p>
                    
                    <p>That <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intended a composite section centered on the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine River</geogName> appears likely; in fact, according to the

                        he intended more than one&#x2014;the sections named

                        which (if either) of these two section titles were meant to contain (either or both) the poem in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title> and the essay in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, 
                        and indeed whether the poem and essay belong together in the same section at all. Of the two sections in the list named for the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>, the first, 
                        <title type="composite" corresp="#JRFALLOFTHERHINECOMP"><geogName corresp="#RHINEFALLS">&#x201C;The Fall of the Rhine&#x201D;</geogName></title>, 
                        is centered in <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName>, falling among a group of titles associated with the sighting of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> from <placeName corresp="#SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</placeName>, 
                        prior to the family&#x02BC;s crossing into <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> (see the contextual glosses for

                        The second of the two <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> titles in the list, <title type="composite" corresp="#JRTHERHINECOMP"><geogName corresp="#RHINE">&#x201C;The Rhine&#x201D;</geogName></title>, is centered in <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName>, 
                        falling between the proposed sections <title type="composite" corresp="#JRBASLECOMP"><placeName corresp="#BASLE">&#x201C;Basle&#x201D;</placeName></title> and

                        in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>, the sole piece of these sections to be created or survive). 
                        The respective contents of the poem and essay about the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> suggest that they should not be joined in the same composite section, but that the prose essay was meant for the German group, 
                        and the poem for the Swiss group. This division is consistent with the manuscript contexts in which the pieces respectively appear&#x2014;the essay about the German <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> being 
                        consistent with most of the draft in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, which concerns northern <geogName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</geogName> and crossing the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> into <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>; and the poem about the Swiss <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> complementing the only other

                    (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>; <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>; <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title> [<date when="1903">1903</date>])&#x2014;</hi>Referring 
                    to the portion of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine River</geogName> that runs through the south of <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName>, and to the <geogName corresp="#HARZ">Harz Mountains</geogName> in the north. 
                    The Ruskins did not visit the <geogName corresp="#HARZ">Harz</geogName> in <date when="1833">1833</date>. In his <date when="1836">1836</date> guidebook, <persName corresp="#JM">John Murray III</persName> adopts a tone of British superiority toward this district, if not toward the people 
                    as does <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in this essay: &#x201C;<geogName corresp="#BROCKEN">The Brocken</geogName>, the loftiest summit, is lower than the highest British mountains, but the <geogName corresp="#HARZ">Hartz</geogName> chain rises alone immediately out of a level plain 
                    extending all the way to the <geogName corresp="#BALTICSEA">Baltic</geogName>, whose inhabitants, accustomed to an uninterrupted flat, exaggerate both the elevation and the beauties of the only range of hills 
                    that fall within their observation. Their scenery would probably appear tame, and their height inconsiderable to one accustomed to the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>, in comparison with which the <geogName corresp="#HARZ">Hartz</geogName> is a mere molehill&#x201D;. 
                    <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName> goes on to note, like <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, that the &#x201C;district may indeed be considered the cradle of innumerable superstitions, some of them even now not extinct, of Gnomes and Cobolds, 
                    witches, and the headless horseman. Several odd&#x2010;shaped masses of granite around the summit of the <geogName corresp="#BROCKEN">Brocken</geogName> are named after the witches; for example, the <geogName corresp="#TEUFELSKANZEL">Devil&#x02BC;s Pulpit</geogName> . . . ; 
                    the <geogName corresp="#HEXENALTAR">Witches&#x02BC; Altar</geogName>; and not far off, the Witches&#x02BC; Lake. According to the well&#x2010;known legend, the witches hold their Sabbath on this spot once a&#x2010;year, 
                    upon the <hi rend="italic">eve</hi> of May&#x2010;day, called in <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName> <hi rend="italic">Walpurgis nacht</hi> from the name of a saint who converted the Saxons

                    <p>In contrast to this condescending introduction to the region, <persName corresp="#FMT">Frances Trollope</persName>, wrote an impressive account of her family&#x02BC;s experiences in the <geogName corresp="#HARZ">Harz</geogName>, 
                    undertaken in the same year as the Ruskins&#x02BC; tour. <persName corresp="#FMT">Trollope</persName> was moved by the forest scenery, even as she suffered trials while scaling the <geogName corresp="#BROCKEN">Brocken</geogName> 
                    on mules. She acknowledges that her imagination was colored by her prior appreciation of German romance, in the form of <persName corresp="#JWG">Goethe</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#GOETHEFAUST"><hi rend="italic">Faust</hi></title> and

                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> refers to its &#x201C;vaulted chambers&#x201D; perhaps because the Renaissance portion of the castle included a vast vaulted cellar. In her travel diary,

                    <p>The nationalistic pride in the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> as a &#x201C;German&#x201D; river was a comparatively recent cultural development, as was the sentiment surrounding the ruined medieval 
                        castles towering on the romantic heights above the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Middle Rhine</geogName>. Until well into the eighteenth century, according to <persName corresp="#RRT">Robert R. Taylor</persName> explains, the castles 
                        evoked in Rhinelanders feelings of rivalrous disunity and oppression rather than a unifying national feeling. For each settlement, the river represented 
                        a differently configured boundary and trade artery. Sentiments changed with the development of German Romanticism and taste for the picturesque in the time of <persName corresp="#JWG">Goethe</persName>, 
                        while a more unified German nationalism accompanied the political realignments that followed the defeat of <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName> and the dissolution of the Napoleonic <orgName corresp="#GERMANCONFEDERATION">German Confederation</orgName>

                        (<date when="1834">1834</date>) by <persName corresp="#EBL">Edward Bulwer&#x2010;Lytton</persName>, in which English fairies accompany a human couple on a tour of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> sets his tale in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>,

                    <p>By rendering these sources as an English story, and framing the story as an inset tale, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> follows the same pattern he used for inserting another 
                        English narrative within a topographical poem describing a non&#x2010;English setting&#x2014;his digression relating the <geogName corresp="#LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</geogName> story of 
                        <persName corresp="#CGOUGH">Gough</persName> and his faithful dog (<ref type="witness" target="the_summit_poem_msviii.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESUMMIT">&#x201C;The Summit&#x201D;</title></ref>). 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> likely adopted this technique of digressing from topographical description to introduce variety of narrative from <persName corresp="#SR">Samuel Rogers</persName>, 
                        whose <title type="poem" corresp="ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> introduces tales in this way to vary the symmetrical structures and forward geographical sequence 
                        of the poem. <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s stories, however, always pretend to be indigenous to the places where they occur in the poem. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> prefers English stories, whether from familiarity or British pride or both.</p>
                    
                    <p>While the idea for <title type="poem" corresp="#JREMIGRATIONOFSPRITES">&#x201C;The Emigration of the Sprites&#x201D;</title> may have originated with the framing introduction 
                        of a narrator that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> sets up at the end of this essay, <title type="essay" corresp="#JRTRADITIONSOFTHERHINE">&#x201C;The traditions of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> have long been celebrated&#x201D; [<geogName corresp="#RHINE">&#x201C;The Rhine&#x201D;</geogName>]</title>, 
                        by the time of composing the narrative poem he had likely abandoned any serious intention of uniting it with the essay in the unfinished fair&#x2010;copy of the 
                        <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>. He had moved on, just as <title type="poem" corresp="#JREMIGRATIONOFSPRITES">&#x201C;The Emigration of the Sprites&#x201D;</title> 
                        advances beyond the octosyllabic couplets that predominate throughout the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, 
                        to experiment with a twelve&#x2010;line stanza. The stanza continues to rely on octosyllabic lines, but consists of a quartet, sestet, and couplet, built from a more ambitious rhyme scheme 
                        (abba cdcdcd ee)&#x2014;an improvisation, perhaps, on a stanza type in <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName> or <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>. Rather than planning the poem for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> perhaps destined it for the annuals&#x2014;the public ambition that had swerved his attention from completing the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> in the first place,

                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears to use the name of the <geogName corresp="#DINARICALPS">Dinaric Alps</geogName> similarly to his evocation of the <geogName corresp="#RHAETIANALPS">Rh&#x00E6;tian Alps</geogName>, to evoke distant boundaries
