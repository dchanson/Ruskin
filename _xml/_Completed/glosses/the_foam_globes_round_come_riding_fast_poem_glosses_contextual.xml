                    In 1813, the year of the poem's publication, the young <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> penned a wry account of the narrative to his mother, 
                    <persName corresp="#CTWR">Catherine</persName>, predicting that it 
                    "will never be much read &#x0026; I hope the Reviewers will assist in checking the career of such loose &#x0026; foolish poems. Mr. Scott 
                    consulted his fame in writing <title type="poem" corresp="#SCOTTMARMION">Marmion</title> &#x0026; the <title type="poem" corresp="#SCOTTMINSTREL">Minstrel</title>&#x2014;if 
                    he continues to value his fame he will write no more". 
                    John James especially scoffed at the character of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WILFRIDWYCLIFFE">Wilfrid</persName>, a boy who is 
                    "very tender hearted, mild, shy, innocent, amorous, &#x0026; sickly, very studious moreover," 
                    and who "prefers sitting up all night hearing the wind howl &#x0026; looking at the moon" in order to write poems about it, rather than "going like other folks to bed. . . . 
                    I expected the first Canto was to send this weekly youth to his grave in a galloping consumption . . . when lo! &#x0026; behold he breaks out upon us all at once 
                    with a song &#x0026; seems as well &#x0026; merry as possible considering that he had nothing but the moon to sing to &#x0026; not even a pipe nor a pot of porter to comfort him withall." 
                    John James could not have predicted how uncannily the character would conform, two decades later, with that of the young John Ruskin

                    <p>In 1823, a drawing of this <geogName corresp="#TEESDALE">Teesdale</geogName> landscape by J. M. W. Turner was published as

                    Ruskin later owned Turner's original 1817 watercolor of this subject).

                    Ruskin could also have had access to another, very different conception of this subject by Turner,
