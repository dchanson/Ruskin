                    Before him is the venerable ruin, rearing its still majestic form on a commanding height. . . . Beyond the town a broad evening shadow mingles the <geogName corresp="#NECKAR">river</geogName> 
                    with the surrounding plain; and it is only when the eye has wandered amongst the dark objects which intersect the valley in every direction, 
                    that it again detects in the distance the silvery thread, gracefuly winding till it is lost in the ample <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> at <placeName corresp="#MANNHEIM">Mannheim</placeName>. 
                    The course of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">&#x2018;Vater Rhein&#x2019;</geogName> may, perchance, be faintly traced, and beyond may be dimly seen the plain and the mountains of Rhenish <placeName corresp="#BAVARIA">Bavaria</placeName>,

                    traveling in the same year as did the Ruskins, explained that &#x201C;there are two approaches to the castle; one, by a fair smooth path, sheltered by noble trees, 
                    and gradually leading above the tops of those which grow on the hill&#x2010;side, till at length the level space behind the castle and in front of the great gateway is reached; 
                    the other is by a steep flight of steps into the very heart of the fortress, through a vast, subterranean, vaulted hall. . . . Take which route you will, 
                    there is no danger of the highest&#x2010;wrought expectations being disappointed. By the first, you will wind round the base of towers, which look as if a giant architect 
                    had reared them for a giant prince . . .  and both lead to a terrace, from whence a view is seen, so much beyond what the power of words can paint, 
                    that all the most faithful traveller can say, to any purpose, on the subject is, &#x2018;Go, all, with as little delay as possible, and look at it.&#x2019; . . . 
                    On reaching the esplanade, before the chief entrance, you have no very extended view; for the lofty summit of the <geogName corresp="#GEISSBERG">Geissberg</geogName> is on one side, 
                    and the wide&#x2010;spreading castle on the other; but, on passing under this portal, and crossing the court&#x2010;yard, you reach another archway, 
                    which leads to the grand north terrace, acknowledged to be one of the finest points of view in <geogName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</geogName>&#x201D;

                    after having been three times burnt, and having ten times experienced the horrors of war. Its final destruction was owing to its having been struck by lightning

                    On one border, <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> was threatened by the <placeName corresp="#SPANISHNETHERLANDS">Spanish Netherlands</placeName>.

                    On another border, <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> was threatened by the German Hapsburgs via the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> and <geogName corresp="#MOSELLE">Moselle</geogName> valleys. In this region, the French did control <placeName corresp="#ALSACE">Alsace</placeName> as a legacy of the <date notBefore="1618" notAfter="1648">Thirty Years&#x02BC; War</date>, 
                    and additional security had been secured through the diplomacy of <persName corresp="#KL14">Louis XIV</persName>&#x02BC;s boyhood minister, <persName corresp="#CJRM">Cardinal Mazarin</persName> (<date notBefore="1602" notAfter="1661">1602&#x2013;61</date>), who forged an alliance with neutral <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">German</placeName> states

                    <p>Within this larger context, the conflict to which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> refers was the second of <persName corresp="#KL14">Louis</persName>&#x02BC;s wars for glory, the <date notBefore="1672" notAfter="1678">Dutch War</date> (<date notBefore="1672" notAfter="1678">1672&#x2013;78</date>), 
                        in which <persName corresp="#TURENNE">Henri de la Tour d&#x02BC;Auvergne, Vicomte Turenne</persName>, the Marshal of <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> (<date notBefore="1611" notAfter="1675">1611&#x2013;75</date>), distinguished himself. In a conflict prior to the <date notBefore="1672" notAfter="1678">Dutch War</date>, 
                        the <date notBefore="1667" notAfter="1668">War of Devolution</date> (<date notBefore="1667" notAfter="1668">1667&#x2013;68</date>), <persName corresp="#KL14">Louis</persName> had laid claim to parts of the <placeName corresp="#SPANISHNETHERLANDS">Spanish Netherlands</placeName> on the grounds that these holdings had &#x201C;devolved&#x201D; 
                    on his Spanish queen. To the immediate north of the <placeName corresp="#SPANISHNETHERLANDS">Spanish Netherlands</placeName>, the <placeName corresp="#DUTCHREPUBLIC">Dutch Republic</placeName> became alarmed by <persName corresp="#KL14">Louis</persName>&#x02BC;s aggression; 
                        and although the <placeName corresp="#DUTCHREPUBLIC">Republic</placeName> had been warring with the English navy, broke off that contest to sign a treaty with <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#SWEDEN">Sweden</placeName>, forming a <orgName corresp="#TRIPLEALLIANCE1668">Triple Alliance</orgName> (<date when="1688">1668</date>). 
                    <persName corresp="#KL14">Louis</persName> regarded this alliance as a betrayal by the <placeName corresp="#DUTCHREPUBLIC">Republic</placeName>, which had stood as a longtime ally against the Hapsburg power in <placeName corresp="#SPANISHNETHERLANDS">Spanish Netherlands</placeName>; 
                    and therefore, he avenged himself by launching the <date notBefore="1672" notAfter="1678">Dutch War</date> directly against the <placeName corresp="#DUTCHREPUBLIC">Republic</placeName>&#x02BC;s territory. 
                        Meanwhile, he undermined the <orgName corresp="#TRIPLEALLIANCE1668">Triple Alliance</orgName> of <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>, the <placeName corresp="#DUTCHREPUBLIC">Dutch Republic</placeName>, 
                        and <placeName corresp="#SWEDEN">Sweden</placeName> by making a secret treaty with the king of <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>, <persName corresp="#KC2">Charles II</persName> (<date notBefore="1630" notAfter="1685">1630&#x2013;85</date>). 
                    For this reason, English troops joined in the French assault on the Dutch, including the young

                        Although the <orgName corresp="#PARLIAMENTBRITAIN">English Parliament</orgName> forced <persName corresp="#KC2">Charles II</persName> to make peace with the <placeName corresp="#DUTCHREPUBLIC">Dutch Republic</placeName> in <date when="1674">1674</date>, motivated both by mercantile interests and by sympathy for <orgName corresp="#PROTESTANTISM">Protestant</orgName> <placeName corresp="#HOLLAND">Holland</placeName>, 
                    some English troops under <persName corresp="#JCDM">Churchill</persName>&#x02BC;s command remained with the French, and they joined with the army led by <persName corresp="#TURENNE">Turenne</persName>, 
                    which was stationed in <placeName corresp="#ALSACE">Alsace</placeName> and the <placeName corresp="#PALATINATE">Palatinate</placeName>

                    <p>In this year, <persName corresp="#KL14">Louis</persName>&#x02BC;s attention turned to the German theater in order to protect <placeName corresp="#ALSACE">Alsace</placeName> while, if possible, capturing <placeName corresp="#FRANCHECOMTE">Franche&#x2010;Comt&#x00E9;</placeName> to the immediate south of <placeName corresp="#ALSACE">Alsace</placeName>. 
                        <persName corresp="#KL14">Louis</persName> treated Franche&#x2010;Comt&#x00E9;, like the <placeName corresp="#SPANISHNETHERLANDS">Spanish Netherlands</placeName>, as a Spanish Hapsburg inheritance that was owing to him. 
                    But <persName corresp="#KL14">Louis</persName> met resistance in the region from <persName corresp="#LGCF">Leopold I</persName>, who was allied with the Dutch, and who 
                        turned Imperial forces against <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>. Meanwhile, the German <orgName corresp="#PROTESTANTISM">Protestant</orgName> <placeName corresp="#PALATINATE">Palatinate</placeName>, which <persName corresp="#CJRM">Mazarin</persName> had drawn to the French side against the <placeName corresp="#HOLYROMANEMPIRE">Empire</placeName>, 
                    was turning against <persName corresp="#KL14">Louis</persName> and his armies owing to <persName corresp="#TURENNE">Turenne</persName>&#x02BC;s occupation of the region between the <geogName corresp="#NECKAR">Neckar</geogName> and the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>. 
                    In <date when="1674-06">June 1674</date>, <persName corresp="#TURENNE">Turenne</persName> led a battle against Imperial forces up to the gates of <placeName type="building" corresp="#HEIDELBERGCASTLE">Heidelberg</placeName>, the seat of the <orgName corresp="#ELECTORALPALATINATE">Elector of the <placeName corresp="#PALATINATE">Palatinate</placeName></orgName>. 
                    In the summer months following, he laid waste to the <geogName corresp="#NECKAR">Neckar</geogName> valley, pillaging to supply his troops, and burning villages that refused to cooperate

                    <p>In <persName corresp="#KL14">Louis</persName>&#x02BC;s ongoing wars, the suffering of the <placeName corresp="#PALATINATE">Palatinate</placeName> continued to stand as symbol for the perceived ruthlessness of the French. 
                        In <date notBefore="1688" notAfter="1689">1688&#x2013;89</date>, at the onset of the <date notBefore="1688" notAfter="1697">Nine Years&#x02BC; War</date> (<date notBefore="1688" notAfter="1697">1688&#x2013;97</date>)&#x2014;the same period in which <persName corresp="#KL14">Louis</persName>&#x02BC;s old enemy, 
                        <persName corresp="#KW3">William of Orange and Stadtholder</persName> of the <placeName corresp="#DUTCHREPUBLIC">Dutch Republic</placeName>, supplanted his father&#x2010;in&#x2010;law, <persName corresp="#KJ2">James II</persName>, 
                        as king of <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>&#x2014;<persName corresp="#KL14">Louis</persName> took defensive measures against the Dutch&#x2010;Imperial alliance by adopting a scorched&#x2010;earth campaign in the <placeName corresp="#PALATINATE">Palatinate</placeName>. 
                    The objective was to prevent an enemy army from being able to support itself in the region. This brutal destruction was not unique in <persName corresp="#KL14">Louis</persName>&#x02BC;s wars, 
                    but &#x201C;the devastation of the <placeName corresp="#PALATINATE">Palatinate</placeName> . . . burned itself into the European conscience&#x201D;, and became,
                    according to a modern historian, &#x201C;one of the influences that inspired Europeans to try to make the conduct of war more restrained and humane in the eighteenth century&#x201D;

                    <p>For this reason, combined with entrenched suspicion of <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> and support for <orgName corresp="#PROTESTANTISM">Protestant</orgName> <geogName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</geogName>, British feeling could still be stirred in the nineteenth century by signs

                        &#x201C;In <date when="1674">1674</date>, the Elector, <persName corresp="#CL1">Charles Louis</persName> [<date notBefore="1617" notAfter="1680">1617&#x2013;80</date>], incurred the displeasure of <persName corresp="#KL14">Louis XIV</persName>; and a French army, under <persName corresp="#TURENNE">Turenne</persName>, was in consequence let loose 
                    upon the <placeName corresp="#PALATINATE">Palatinate</placeName>, carrying slaughter and desolation before them. <persName corresp="#CL1">The Elector</persName> beheld with distress, from the castle in which he had shut himself up, 
                    the inroads of foreign troops, and flame and smoke rising up along the plain from burning towns and villages. Unable to oppose the French with equal force 
                    at the head of an army, but anxious to avenge the wrongs of his country, he resolved, in a spirit which some may deem Quixotic, others chivalrous, 
                    to endeavour to end the contest with his own sword; and accordingly he sent a cartel to <persName corresp="#TURENNE">Marshal Turenne</persName>, challenging him to single combat. 
                    The French general returned a civil answer, hut did not accept it. The ambition of <persName corresp="#KL14">Louis XIV</persName> led him, on the death of the <persName corresp="#CL1">Elector</persName>, to lay claim to the <placeName corresp="#PALATINATE">Palatinate</placeName> 
                    on behalf of [his younger brother,] the <persName corresp="#P1DO">Duke of Orleans</persName> [<date notBefore="1640" notAfter="1701">1640&#x2013;1701</date>, whose second marriage was to the daughter of Elector <persName corresp="#CL1">Charles Louis</persName>], 
                    and another French army, more wicked than the first, was marched across the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>. 
                        <placeName corresp="#HEIDELBERG">Heidelberg</placeName> was taken and burnt, <date when="1688">1688</date> [the onset of the <date notBefore="1688" notAfter="1697">Nine Years&#x02BC; War</date>], by <persName corresp="#EDM">[Compte de] M&#x00E9;lac</persName> [<date notBefore="1630" notAfter="1704">1630&#x2013;1704</date>], a general whose brutality and cruelty surpassed that

                    But it was at the following siege under <persName corresp="#NBM">[the Marquis de] Chamilly</persName> [<date notBefore="1636" notAfter="1715">1636&#x2013;1715</date>], in <date when="1693">1693</date>, that it was reserved for the French to display the most merciless tyranny, 
                    and practise excesses worthy of fiends rather than men, upon the town and its inhabitants, paralleled only in the <date notBefore="1789" notAfter="1799">French Revolution</date>, 
                    and which will ever render the name of Frenchman odious in the <placeName corresp="#PALATINATE">Palatinate</placeName>. The castle was betrayed through the cowardice or treachery of the governor, 
                    with the garrison, and many of the townspeople who had fled to it for refuge. The cruelty of the treatment they met with was, in this instance, 
                    heightened by religious intolerance, and no mercy was shown to the <orgName corresp="#PROTESTANTISM">Protestants</orgName>. On this occasion <placeName type="building" corresp="#HEIDELBERGCASTLE">the castle</placeName> was entirely destroyed&#x201D;
