                    to cross the <geogName corresp="#SPLUGEN">Spl&#x00FC;gen</geogName>, &#x201C;one of the wildest and most beautiful passes of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>&#x201D;,

                    <p><persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName>&#x02BC;s account of the day&#x02BC;s journey is condensed, starting with where &#x201C;the lower and higher Rhine unite&#x201D; 
                        (i.e., the confluence of the <geogName corresp="#VORDERRHEIN">Vorderrhein</geogName> and <geogName corresp="#HINTERRHEIN">Hinterrhein</geogName> at <placeName corresp="#REICHENAU">Reichenau</placeName>), 
                        &#x201C;a little below <placeName corresp="#THUSIS">Thusis</placeName>&#x201D;. From here, she continues, the &#x201C;road goes along the side of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>&#x201D; 
                        (i.e, the <geogName corresp="#HINTERRHEIN">Hinterrhein</geogName>); and entering the gorge of the <geogName corresp="#VIAMALA">Via Mala</geogName>, the passage leads between 
                        &#x201C;immense high rocks [that] rise almost perpendicularly on each side of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> (which is here a narrow stream) . . . covered 
                        in many parts to the very top with majestic pines&#x201D;. Her next sentence remarks &#x201C;houses surrounded by richly cultivated land&#x201D;, and then she briefly describes 
                        <geogName corresp="#SPLUGEN">Spl&#x00FC;gen Pass</geogName> and the <placeName corresp="#SPLUGENVILLAGE">village of Spl&#x00FC;gen</placeName>. 
                        The cultivated region beyond the <geogName corresp="#VIAMALA">Via Mala</geogName> probably refers to the village of <placeName corresp="#ANDEER">Andeer</placeName> 
                        in the <geogName corresp="#SCHAMS">Schams Valley</geogName>. Beyond its &#x201C;beautiful rich vineyards&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> fails to mention the 
                        cataract in the <geogName corresp="#ROFLARAVINE">Gorge of Rofla</geogName>, where the river is confined into a torrent, but she does comment approvingly on the new <placeName corresp="#AUSTRIA">Austrian</placeName> road, 
                        &#x201C;good as any road in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Great Britain</placeName>&#x201D;, which led the family over the <geogName corresp="#SPLUGEN">Spl&#x00FC;gen</geogName>. 
                        Had they continued traveling along the <geogName corresp="#HINTERRHEIN">Hinterrhein</geogName>, they would have entered the <geogName corresp="#RHEINWALD">Rheinwald Valley</geogName> 
                        and crossed instead at the <geogName corresp="#SANBERNARDINOPASS">San Bernardino Pass</geogName>, which descends to <geogName corresp="#LAKEMAGGIORE">Lago Maggiore</geogName> 
                        rather than to <geogName corresp="LAKECOMO">Lago di Como</geogName> below the <geogName corresp="#SPLUGEN">Spl&#x00FC;gen</geogName> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48">Diary of <persName corresp="MRC">Mary Richardson</persName>, 1833</ref>, 40&#x2013;41).</p>
                    
                    <p>Preferring the sublime over the beautiful cultivated places that catch his cousin&#x02BC;s eye, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> focuses his poem on the foaming 
                        of the swollen yet narrowly confined <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>, &#x201C;like an avalanche below&#x201D;, which, as the traveler climbs the precipitous steep above the river, 
                        is gradually &#x201C;softened&#x201D; in its roar to &#x201C;Murmuring up from the profound / Of distance dark where light of day / Pierced not&#x201D; but 
                        &#x201C;Whence the white foam looked up so clear&#x201D;. Some of these details may have been prompted by <persName corresp="#WBI">William Brockedon</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        description in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BROCKEDONILLUSTRATIONS"><title type="book" corresp="#BROCKEDONILLUSTRATIONS"><hi rend="italic">Illustrations of the Passes of the Alps</hi></title></ref>, 
                        which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> received for his <date when="1834-02">February 1834 birthday</date>. For a span of four miles, <persName corresp="#WBI">Brockedon</persName> writes, 
                        &#x201C;a deep ravine is formed by the bases of mountains, rising 6000 and even 8000 feet above the torrent of the <geogName corresp="#HINTERRHEIN">Hinter-Rhin</geogName>, 
                        which separates them&#x201D;. He adds in a note: &#x201C;In many places, where the road is carried 300 or 400 feet above the river, the sides of the ravine are not 50 feet apart. 
                        Such spots have been chosen for the construction of bridges, which it requires a firm head to look over steadily. The struggles of the torrent from that depth reach the ear 
                        only in murmurs; and when seen amidst the deep and dark abyss, its white foam appears to go up the ravine, from the eddy which its violence produces&#x201C; 
                        (vol. 2, &#x201C;The Pass of the Bernardin&#x201D;, p. 7). In his poem, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> does not recoil from &#x201C;looking oer the barrier&#x201D;, 
                        and he reports what may be more unique to his memory of the vista, &#x201C;A strange cold light through the yawning dread / Of the Abyssy gulph below&#x201D;.</p>
                    
                    <p>By <date when="1838">1838</date>, <persName corresp="#JM">John Murray III</persName> was moved to give the traveler a more expansive and dramatic description of the <geogName corresp="#VIAMALA">Via Mala</geogName> than 
                        <persName corresp="#WBI">Brockedon</persName>&#x02BC;s: &#x201C;It is difficult to give, with any precision, the dimensions of this gorge, which has cleft the mountains through the chine. 
                        The precipices, which often rise perpendicularly on both sides of it, are certainly in some places 1600 ft. high, and, in many places, not more than 10 yards apart. 
                        The <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>, compressed within this narrow, stony bed to the width of a pigmy rivulet, is barely audible as it rushes 
                        through the depths below the road. The rocks of slate and limestone, composing the walls of the ravine, are so hard that they appear to have suffered no disintegration 
                        from the weather; the fracture is so fresh and sharp that, were the convulsive force from below, which divided them, again called forth to unite them, 
                        it seems as though the gulf would close and leave no aperture behind. When the traveller enters the mouth of the defile&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;the peasants give it the name of the

                        of sunshine, to the gloom of a chasm so narrow that it leaves but a strip of sky visible overhead, is exceedingly striking&#x201D;. <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName> 
                        urges the traveler to dismount from the carriage and make the journey on foot, as he describes the scenery from the three bridges that cross from side to side above the river

                    <p><persName corresp="#WBI">Brockedon</persName>, who was an inventor as well as an artist and writer, weights his description more on the side of engineering than of poetry, 
                        impressed by the feat of <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>&#x02BC;s engineers in laying roads across the <geogName corresp="#SIMPLON">Simplon</geogName> 
                        and <geogName corresp="#CENIS">Cenis</geogName> passes, which he perceives as overcoming not only natural barriers but also the &#x201C;prejudices of those nations 
                        who had opposed the making of such roads as would facilitate future communication&#x201D;. Now that &#x201C;national jealousies have been removed, and a more enlightened policy 
                        has extended commercial intercourse&#x201D;, he believes, other &#x201C;mule paths&#x201D; across the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> &#x201C;have been superseded 
                        by carriage roads; and not only have the governments of <placeName corresp="#AUSTRIA">Austria</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#SARDINIAKINGDOM">Sardinia</placeName>, 
                        and <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName>, carefully preserved the routes in the great lines of communication which were made by <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>, 
                        for military or commerical purposes, but they have made other roads on their frontiers acros the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>&#x201D;

                        Because of these efforts, the sublime experience of <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alpine</geogName> crossing had been rendered safe for travelers in the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date> 
                        (albeit set back by disastrous floods of <date when="1834">1834</date>)&#x2014;a &#x201C;surface . . . as good as any road in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Great Britain</placeName>&#x201D;,

                        almost as much as they mythologize the ambition of <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>. (Credit properly belonged also to <persName corresp="#GLP">Pocobelli</persName>&#x02BC;s assistant, 
                        <persName corresp="#RLN">Richard La Nicca</persName> [<date notBefore="1794" notAfter="1883">1794&#x2013;1883</date>].) For <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>, 
                        marveling about engineering could combine easily with admiration of the picturesque: <persName corresp="#GLP">Pocobelli</persName> having blasted a tunnel through the 
                        <geogName corresp="#VERLORENLOCH">Verlohrne Loch</geogName>, piercing a &#x201C;projecting buttress of rock which had previously denied all access&#x201D;, the resulting 
                        view &#x201C;is very pleasing&#x201D;, &#x201C;looking back from this [tunnel passage], through the dark vista of black rock and the fringe of firs upon the ruined
