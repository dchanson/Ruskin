                    The city was important as a banking and mercantile center, with a large Jewish population
                    including such prosperous families as the <orgName corresp="#ROTHSCHILD">Rothschilds</orgName>. Ministers from <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Great Britain</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</placeName> were stationed here; accordingly, in his guidebook,

                    In <placeName corresp="#FRANKFURT">Frankfurt</placeName>, the family stayed in the <placeName type="building" corresp="#HOTELDERUSSIE">Hotel de Russie</placeName>, erected by a gentleman of property for his own use, according to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cousin, <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName>,

                    <p>On Monday, <persName corresp="#KOCH">Mr. Koch</persName> drove the Ruskins to a cemetery, doubtless the <placeName type="building" corresp="#FRANKFURTNEWCEMETERY">New Cemetery (Neue Friedhof)</placeName> beyond the city walls,
                        which <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName> recommended for its &#x201C;charming view of <placeName corresp="#FRANKFURT">Frankfort</placeName>, and the <geogName corresp="#TAUNUSR">Taunus [River]</geogName>&#x201D;.
                        Opened in <date when="1828">1828</date> along with the adjacent Jewish cemetery, the <placeName type="building" corresp="#FRANKFURTNEWCEMETERY">New Cemetery</placeName> presented an example of the public cemetery that was starting to replace church and churchyard burial,
                        an antiquated custom according to <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="loudon_j_c_note.php"><persName corresp="#JCL">John Claudius Loudon</persName></ref> 
                        that &#x201C;deserve[d] to be abolished&#x201D; especially in &#x201C;large and densely inhabited cities&#x201D;. 
                        The most famous example of the new trend was the

                        which the Ruskins visited toward the end of their tour 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>, <hi rend="italic"><title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836">Hand&#x2010;book for Travellers on the Continent</title></hi></ref>, 405;

                    <p>Visiting the <placeName corresp="FRANKFURT">Frankfurt</placeName> cemetery in about the same year as did the Ruskins, 
                        the English artist <persName corresp="#JML">James Mathews Leigh</persName> (<date notBefore="1808" notAfter="1860">1808&#x2013;60</date>) 
                        noted, like <persName corresp="#JCL">Loudon</persName>, the neoclassicism of the architecture,
                        while also enjoying propects influenced by the picturesque tradition.
                        The structures were designed by the neoclassical architect, <persName corresp="#FRUMPF">Friedrich Rumpf</persName> (<date notBefore="1795" notAfter="1867">1795&#x2013;1867</date>),
                        and the grounds were laid out in English garden style by <persName corresp="#SRINZ">Sebastian Rinz</persName> (<date notBefore="1782" notAfter="1861">1782&#x2013;1861</date>).
                        A Doric propylaeum formed the entrance, which doubled as apartments for burial preparations &#x201C;undertaken by a Company at small cost&#x201D;, indicating the new commercial cemetery operations
                        that were displacing parish church control; and the burial plots were housed both in a necropolis&#x2010;style &#x201C;simple colonnade . . . divided into fifty&#x2010;five compartments&#x201D;,
                        &#x201C;each . . . devoted to a family vault&#x201D;, and in grander, &#x201C;handsome mausoleum[s]&#x201D; that stood apart from the colonnade. <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName>, with her usual British pride,
                        considered the <placeName corresp="#FRANKFURT">Frankfurt</placeName> cemetery inferior to one in <placeName corresp="#LIVERPOOL">Liverpool</placeName>,
                        likely referring to <placeName type="building" corresp="#STJAMESSCEMETERY">St. James&#x02BC;s Cemetery</placeName>, opened in <date when="1829">1829</date> as a pioneering British alternative to overcrowded urban churchyards.
                        Designed by <persName corresp="#JFOSTERA">John Foster</persName> (<date notBefore="1787" notAfter="1846">1787&#x2013;1846</date>), this site likewise featured severe neoclassicism in the form of a Doric temple,
                        the <placeName type="building" corresp="#LIVERPOOLORATORY">Oratory</placeName>. Thus, contemporary cemetery architecture and sepulchral monuments presented <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>
                        with one notable experience of modern neoclassicism; see also

                    Since <persName corresp="#MDESAXE">Maurice de Saxe</persName> remained a Lutheran throughout his life, the commission of his elaborate tomb by the French crown
                    was regarded as a symbol of tolerance of Protestantism in the province of <placeName corresp="#ALSACE">Alsace</placeName>.</p>

                    but it is now very much decayed, notwithstanding the efforts which <persName corresp="#NBE">Buonaparte</persName> made to re&#x2010;establish it.
                    The town is badly built, the houses filthy, and many of them uninhabited&#x201D;. As principal tourist sites,

                    She then describes their intrepid descent into the gorge, again borrowing on the following account in <persName corresp="#JGE">Ebel</persName>:</p>
                    <floatingText>
                        <body>
                            <div type="essay">
                                <p>The most lively imagination could not describe the entrance of <placeName corresp="#TARTARUS">Tartarus</placeName>, under so hideous a form as that which nature has displayed in framing the defile of the <geogName corresp="#TAMINAG">Tamina</geogName>.
                                    You enter it over a bridge composed of planks that rest on wedges beat into the rocks. This bridge is 6 or 700 paces long, which requires above a quarter of an hour
                                    to get over, as you must proceed with great caution. It is suspended over the <geogName corresp="#TAMINAG">Tamina</geogName>, which is heard to roll furiously beneath it thirty or forty feet deep.
                                    Near to the bridge the defile is thirty feet wide, but lower down it straitens as it descends along the torrent. The lateral walls, cleft and torn in divers ways,
                                    rise 200 feet high, bend towards each other in the shape of a dome, and are 290 feet in height at that part where they entirely join. The faint light which illumines
                                    the entrance of the defile disappears in proportion as you proceed; and the damp cold that prevails increases the horror of the place. Sometimes the rocks
                                    that overhang the bridge are so close, that they will not allow one to stand up; and at another time they are so distant from it, that they no longer serve as a support.
                                    The bridge is narrow, often very slippery, and it will sometimes occur that one single plank stands between the traveller and the dark abyss of the <geogName corresp="#TAMINAG">Tamina</geogName>. . . .
                                    The best method of avoiding danger is to walk between two men, each of them holding the extremities of a pole on the side of the precipice, which will serve as a support
                                    and a railing to the tourist. The spring is situated beyond the bridge. . . . I shall invite all such people, who are unwilling to expose themselves to the danger
                                    of going as far as the spring, to advance at least fifty paces on the bridge, beyond the entrance of the defile, and to sit down there to view at leisure the terrific prospect
                                    of that dreadful passage.</p>

                    responded enthusiastically to the Gothic cathedral, a preference that led early in the development of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNT">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s only completed poem about <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName>,

                    In that poem, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> emphasizes the vertical thrust of the carthedral, comparing its spires to <geogName corresp="#MONTEROSA">Monte Rosa</geogName> rising on the city&#x02BC;s horizon,
                    whereas he projected, but evidently failed to execute a poem or essay on the <placeName type="building" corresp="#PORTAVENEZIA">Corso</placeName>, which presumably would have directed attention to the horizontal axes and breadth of the <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Enlightenment city</placeName>.
                    Nonetheless, the Ruskins did seek out monuments in <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName> that attested to <persName corresp="NBE">Napoleon</persName>&#x02BC;s thwarted plans

                    both to glaciers near the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STRADADELSEMPIONE">Simplon Road</placeName> and to the glaciers of the <geogName corresp="#BERNESEALPS">Bernese Alps</geogName> 
                    as viewed from the summit of the pass. The road approached especially close to glaciers

                    from the <geogName corresp="#KALTWASSERPASS">Kaltwasser Glacier</geogName> on <geogName corresp="#MONTELEONE">Monte Leone</geogName> (the terminus and highest peak of the <geogName corresp="#LEOPONTINEALPS">Leopontine Alps</geogName>, which forms the east side of the pass). 
                    The galleries, &#x201C;partly excavated, partly built of masonry strongly arched&#x201D;, were constructed with &#x201C;ingenious contrivance&#x201D;  
                    to &#x201C;serve in places as bridges and aqueducts at the same time, the torrents being conducted over and beneath them; 
                    and the traveller is surprised to find his carriage suddenly driven in perfect safety underneath a considerable waterfall&#x201D;. 
                    Gazing ahead into the distance, meanwhile, &#x201C;the traveller&#x02BC;s attention&#x201D; was &#x201C;riveted by the glorious view&#x201D; of the <geogName corresp="#ALETSCH">Aletsch Glacier</geogName> between the peaks of the <geogName corresp="#BERNESEALPS">Bernese Alps</geogName>,

                    According to <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>, a twenty&#x2010;minute walk behind the main inn brought the traveler to a cascade, of which the &#x201C;volume of water is considerable&#x201D;,

                        Even more curiously, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> situates <placeName corresp="#TURTMANN">Turtmann</placeName> where one would expect <placeName corresp="#SION">Sion</placeName> in his <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">List of Proposed Additional Contents for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>. 
                        <placeName corresp="#SION">Sion</placeName> was considered the principal town of <placeName corresp="#CANTONVALAIS">canton Valais</placeName>, and the Ruskins spent two nights and their entire Sunday (<date when="1833-07-08">July 8</date>) there. </p>

                <p>In departing from <placeName corresp="MARTIGNY">Martigny</placeName> for the <geogName corresp="#STBERNARD">Great St. Bernard</geogName>, the Ruskins would have been mindful&#x2014;alerted by the guidebooks of the period&#x2014;that 
                    they followed <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>&#x02BC;s path in <date when="1800">1800</date>, when he led his army through the treacherous pass

                    <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName>&#x02BC;s account of the ascent agrees with particulars in the guidebooks, although <persName corresp="#JGE">Murray</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1838">1838</date> account 
                    reflects improvements in the road that may have postdated the Ruskins&#x02BC; journey.</p>
                    
                    <p>From <placeName corresp="#MARTIGNY">Martigny</placeName>, the family along with <persName corresp="#SALVADOR">Salvador</persName> and <persName corresp="#ASB">Ann</persName> traveled in two char&#x2010;&#x00E0;&#x2010;bancs
                    through scenery that the guidebooks dismiss as dull, but then, on entering the <geogName corresp="#VALDENTREMONT">Val d&#x02BC;Entremont</geogName>, as <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> says, the scenery became 
                    &#x201C;very fine, high rocks, with <name type="botanical" corresp="#PINE">pine</name> forests and cottages and cultivated ground almost to the top&#x201D;. The valley is drained by the <geogName corresp="#DRANSEDENTREMONT">Dranse d&#x02BC;Entremont</geogName>, 
                    a tributary of the <geogName corresp="#DRANSERIVER">Dranse</geogName>, which the Ruskins skirted on their four&#x2010;and&#x2010;a&#x2010;half&#x2010;hour ride from <placeName corresp="#MARTIGNY">Martigny</placeName>. They 
                    paused in the village of <placeName corresp="#LIDDES">Liddes</placeName>, where they found other tourists preparing to continue the ascent. While the Ruskins dined, their mules were unhitched 
                        from the vehicles and allowed a rest, before being saddled to carry them the remaining four&#x2010;hour trek up the mountain to the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STBERNARNDHOSPICE">hospice</placeName>.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Ruskins started out from <placeName corresp="#LIDDES">Liddes</placeName> on foot, the muleteer and animals catching up with them at <placeName corresp="#BOURGSAINTPIERRE">Bourg Saint Pierre</placeName>, the last village in the valley before the final ascent to the pass. 
                    Beyond the village, the path rose high above the river, the incline becoming &#x201C;more rapid and the road narrower and more stony&#x201D;, 
                    and the <name type="botanical" corresp="#PINE">pines</name> and <name type="botanical" corresp="#LARCH">larches</name> giving way to &#x201C;bare rocks&#x201D;. Even here, the Ruskins observed &#x201C;cultivation&#x201D; of land and &#x201C;great quantities of the beautiful <name type="botanical" corresp="#ALPINEROSE">Alpine rose</name>&#x201D;. 
                    But now in view the highest peak, <geogName corresp="#MONTVELAN">Mont V&#x00E9;lan</geogName>, and its glaciers, the Ruskins had entered on the most rugged stage of the climb through the forest of <placeName corresp="#BOURGSAINTPIERRE">Saint Pierre</placeName> and, 
                    crossing the snow line, onto a bleak slope that writers called the <geogName corresp="#PLAINOFPROU">Plain of Prou</geogName> or <geogName corresp="#PLAINOFPROU">Sommet de Prou</geogName>. 
                    At this height, as <persName corresp="#WBI">Brockedon</persName> along with other guidebook writers remarks, &#x201C;the brethren of the convent&#x201D; had established both a refuge and a charnel house, 
                    since &#x201C;many of the victims to the storms of these regions&#x201D; were discovered by the monks and their dogs.</p>
                    
                    <p>In <date when="1800">1800</date>, <persName corresp="#WBI">Brockedon</persName> adds, this final segment of the climb presented 
                    <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>&#x02BC;s army with &#x201C;the chief obstacles to the conveyance of the mounted artillery&#x201D;; and the general himself had a narrow escape, 
                        when falling from his mule, and had to be rescued by a peasant&#x2014;an inglorious reality, compared to the impression of this expedition conveyed by the equestrian portrait, <title type="artwork" corresp="#DAVIDNAPOLEONCROSSINGALPS"><hi rend="italic">Napoleon Crossing the Alps</hi></title> (<date when="1803">1803</date>), 
                    by <persName corresp="#JLD">Jacques&#x2010;Louis David</persName>. The Ruskins experienced a similar hazard, <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> relates, when the lead mule carrying <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> tumbled into the snow, 
                    though both animal and rider landed softly. Following this accident, and now enshrouded by fog, the family party decided to walk the rest of the way, 
                    coming suddenly on the obscured <placeName type="building" corresp="#STBERNARNDHOSPICE">hospice</placeName> at 7:15 in the evening&#x2014;a total of ten hours following their departure from <placeName corresp="#MARTIGNY">Martigny</placeName>, 
                    which is exactly the time predicted for the ascent by <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>&#x02BC;s guidebook

                        &#x201C;Such is the scene presented to the traveller at the <hi rend="italic"><placeName type="building" corresp="#SAINTMAURICEBRIDGE">Bridge of St. Maurice</placeName></hi>,
                        which spans the rapid river with one bold arch, 70 ft. wide, leaning for support (appuy&#x00E9;) on the rt. side upon the <geogName corresp="#DENTDEMORCLES">Dent de Morcles</geogName> [i.e., the western end of the <geogName corresp="#BERNESEALPS">Bernese Alps</geogName>]

                        whose bases are pushed so far forward as barely to leave room for the river. The <placeName type="building" corresp="#SAINTMAURICEBRIDGE">bridge</placeName>, erroneously attributed to the Romans,
                        is not older than the <date notBefore="1400" notAfter="1499">15th century</date>, but may possibly rest on Roman foundations. It unites the <placeName corresp="#CANTONVAUD">canton Vaud</placeName> [to the west, above <geogName corresp="#LAKEGENEVA">Lake Geneva</geogName>]

                    <p>British travelers often applied a more invidious meaning to the passage at <placeName type="building" corresp="#SAINTMAURIC">Saint&#x2010;Maurice</placeName>, 
                        regarding it as the divide between the <orgName corresp="#ROMANCATHOLICCHURCH">Catholic</orgName> and <orgName corresp="#PROTESTANTISM">Protestant</orgName> Swiss cantons. Proceeding west toward <orgName corresp="#PROTESTANTISM">Protestant</orgName> <placeName corresp="#GENEVA">Geneva</placeName>, 
                        <persName corresp="#MURRAY">Murray</persName> lectures the traveler: &#x201C;No one can cross the <placeName type="building" corresp="#SAINTMAURICEBRIDGE">bridge at St. Maurice</placeName> 
                        without being struck with the change in the condition of the inhabitants of the two cantons. The neatness and industry
                        of the <placeName corresp="#CANTONVAUD">Vaudois</placeName> are exchanged within the space of a few hundred yards for filth and beggary, equally apparent in the persons and habitations 
                        of the <placeName corresp="#CANTONVALAIS">Vallaisans</placeName>. Their physical condition is lamentable; no part of <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName> is afflicted 
                        to a greater extent with the maladies of go&#x00EE;tre and cretinism . . . , and the victims of them shock the traveller&#x02BC;s sight at every step&#x201D;
