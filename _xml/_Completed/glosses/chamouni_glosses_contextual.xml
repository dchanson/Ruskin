                    describes the ascent to the <geogName corresp="#MONTANVERT">Montanvert</geogName>, an elevated viewpoint overlooking the <geogName corresp="#MERDEGLACE">Mer de Glace</geogName>.</p>
                    
                    <p>The enormous glacier, a confluence of three glaciers descending from <placeName corresp="#MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</placeName>, reached the edge of the valley in the eighteenth and nineteenth 
                        centuries, terminating in the so&#x2010;called <geogName corresp="#GLACIERDESBOIS">Glacier du Bois</geogName> and the source of the <geogName corresp="#ARVERON">Arveron</geogName>. To gain a view 
                        of the <geogName corresp="#MERDEGLACE">Mer de Glace</geogName>, travelers followed a path from the village to the top of the <geogName corresp="#MONTANVERT">Montanvert</geogName>. 
                        From here, according to <persName corresp="#JM">John Murray III</persName> in his <date when="1838">1838</date> guidebook to <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName>, 
                        the spectator enjoyed a prospect &#x201C;of two leagues up the valley&#x201D; between the needles that was filled by the glacier. &#x201C;The view of this enormous sea of ice 
                        is one of the most striking in these scenes of wonder, but its great extent, from the vast size of every object about it, is very deceptive. Directly across the <geogName corresp="#MERDEGLACE">Mer de Glace</geogName> 
                        [facing northeast] are some of the those pinnacled mountains which form so striking a feature in the <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamouny</placeName> scenery. The nearest is the <geogName corresp="#AIGUILLEDUDRU">Aiguille du Dru</geogName>, 
                        and still further on the right, is the <geogName corresp="#AIGUILLEDUMOINE">Aiguille du Moine</geogName>. A thousand nameless pinnacles pierce the clouds between them, 
                        and seem to prop the loftiest of this stupendous mass which is the <geogName corresp="#AIGUILLEVERTE">Aiguille Verte</geogName>, that rises more than 13,000 feet above the level 
                        of the sea and nearly 7000 feet above the <geogName corresp="#MONTANVERT">Montanvert</geogName>&#x201D;. Atop the <geogName corresp="#MONTANVERT">Montanvert</geogName>, 
                        travelers could rest in two shelters, which were built in the late eighteenth century (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITERZERLAND1838"><hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book for Travellers in Switzerland</hi></title></ref>, 294;

                    <p><persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName> remarks that the <geogName corresp="#MONTANVERT">Montanvert</geogName> was &#x201C;generally the first, often the only excursion made 
                        from <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamouny</placeName>&#x201D;. The Ruskins made this excursion on <date when="1833-08-17">17 August</date>, riding on mules led by official guides. 
                        Although steep and formidable, the ascent was safe for &#x201C;ladies, or unpractised travellers&#x201D;, according to<persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>, since &#x201C;the guide 
                        is generally in attendance in all places of difficulty&#x201D;. One of the Ruskins&#x02BC; guides was said in his youth to have accompanied <persName corresp="#HBC">Saussure</persName> himself

                    <p><persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>&#x02BC;s description of the trek up the <geogName corresp="#MONTANVERT">Montanvert</geogName> corresponds well to 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s account of the climb on the &#x201C;steepy crag&#x201D; in his poem, winding among the trees above the <geogName corresp="#ARVE">Arve</geogName>, 
                        with glimpses of the valley below: &#x201C;To go to the <geogName corresp="#MONTANVERT">Montanvert</geogName> it is necessary to cross the <geogName corresp="#ARVE">Arve</geogName> 
                        and the opposite meadows, by a path which leads across the valley to the foot of the <geogName corresp="#MONTANVERT">Montanvert</geogName>, where the path rises above the valley, 
                        through the forest of pines which skirts the base of the mountain, in some places very steep. . .el . After a scramble amidst rocks, and the roots of 
                        <name type="botanical" corresp="#PINE">pine</name>s and <name type="botanical" corresp="#LARCH">larch</name>es, occasional openings among the trees afford peeps into the valley, 
                        and mark the great height so rapidly attained. Sometimes <hi rend="italic">crues</hi> are crossed&#x2014;the channels of avalanches in the winter, which sweep down every thing 
                        in their course. Here the guides generally perform the <hi rend="italic">mystery</hi> of desiring silence, lest a whisper should disturb the slumbering snows above, 
                        and bring down destruction by displacing a rock&#x201D;. Despite <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>&#x02BC;s skepticism about these mysteries, <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName> 
                        claims that the family witnessed a small avalanche while gazing at the peaks from atop the <geogName corresp="#MONTANVERT">Montanvert</geogName>

                        [appear], which rise nearly 8000 feet above the level of the sea, and immediately over the village of <placeName corresp="#STMARTINSAVOY">St. Martin</placeName>, which now opens to the view. . . . 
                        [In the village,] a bridge crosses the <geogName corresp="#ARVE">Arve</geogName>, and leads to the town of <placeName corresp="#SALLANCHES">Sallenches</placeName>. . . . On this bridge 
                        one of the noblest views on the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> is presented of <geogName corresp="#MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</geogName>: its actual distance to the peak is more than 
                        12 miles in a direct line, yet so sharp, and bright, and clear in every part of its stupendous mass, that the eye, unused to such magnitude with distinctness, is utterly deceived, 
                        and would rather lead to the belief that it was not one third of the distance. On looking up the valley over the broad winter&#x2010;bed of the <geogName corresp="#ARVE">Arve</geogName> however, 
                        objects recede, and give the accustomed impressions of distance; above this rises the mountain of the Forclaz, its sides clothed with pines, and its summit with pasturage. 
                        Over these, are seen the <geogName corresp="#AIGUILLEDUGOUTER">Aiguille de Gout&#x00E8;</geogName>, the <geogName corresp="#DOMEDUGOUTER">Dome de Gout&#x00E8;</geogName>, 
                        and the head of the loftiest mountain in Europe, propped by ridges of aiguilles, and the intervals of these filled with glaciers. This one view, the first usually enjoyed by travellers 
                        from <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamouny</placeName>, is so impressive as to be generally acknowledged a sufficient reward for the journey&#x201C;

                        they could not engage a guide, who would have been fined for leading an excursion prior to church service. Accordingly, <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName> writes, 
                        they engaged a guide&#x02BC;s little boy, who had helped lead them on the previous day&#x02BC;s trek up the <geogName corresp="#MONTANVERT">Montanvert</geogName>. The child 
                        &#x201C;made his appearance, dressed in his Sunday clothes which all seemed made to allow for his growing. The poor child seemed buried under them especially the hat which might have done 
                        for his father&#x201D;. They set out on the the previous day&#x02BC;s easy path to the source of the <geogName corresp="#ARVERON">Arveyron</geogName>, but found a steeper path, 
                        which interested the Ruskins but tired the boy. Excusing the boy to return to the village, the party pushed onward, until they found where the path divides, leading two ways 
                        through the mountain pass to <placeName corresp="#MARTIGNY">Martigny</placeName>. One direction led to the <geogName corresp="#COLDEBALME">Col de Balme</geogName>, and the other
