                    The <placeName type="building" corresp="#VILLAPLINIANA">Villa Pliniana</placeName> was built on the lakeshore in the sixteenth century around the supposed spring mentioned

                    and described at length by the younger <persName corresp="#PLINYYOUNGER">Pliny</persName> in a letter to <persName corresp="#LLSURA">Licinius Sura</persName> 
                    (<title type="book" corresp="#PLINYEPISTULAE"><hi rend="italic">Epistulae</hi></title>, bk. 4, letter 30): &#x201C;There is a spring which rises in the mountain, and running among the rocks is received into a little banqueting&#x2010;room, 
                    from whence, after being detained a short time, it falls into the <geogName corresp="#LARIANLAKE">Larian lake</geogName>&#x201D;. <persName corresp="#PLINYYOUNGER">Pliny</persName> 
                    relishes reclining by the fountain, drinking the cool water and watching the spring &#x201C;rise and fall by fixed and measured gradations&#x201D;. He goes on to speculate about the cause

                    Visitors to the villa could read this letter inscribed on &#x201C;two large tablets of black marble&#x201D;, one in Latin and the other in an Italian translation

                    <p><persName corresp="#PLINYYOUNGER">Pliny</persName>&#x02BC;s letter demonstrates engagement in the idealized pursuits of country villa life (see 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ACKERMANVILLA"><persName corresp="#JSACKERMAN">Ackerman</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#ACKERMANVILLA"><hi rend="italic">The Villa</hi></title></ref>, 37). 
                        In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, not only is the point of <persName corresp="#PLINYYOUNGER">Pliny</persName>&#x02BC;s refinement 
                        missed in the clich&#x00E9;s drawn from the vocabulary of the picturesque about the dead underfoot; the poem also perversely fails to look overhead at surroundings that impressed 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cousin, just as it moved other English visitors, such as <persName corresp="#PBS">Percy Shelley</persName>. 
                        In <date when="1818">1818</date>, <persName corresp="#PBS">Shelley</persName> wrote to <persName corresp="#TLPEACOCK">Thomas Love Peacock</persName> about trying to procure the 
                        <placeName type="building" corresp="#VILLAPLINIANA">Villa Pliniana</placeName> for an extended stay on the lake. As published by <persName corresp="#MWS">Mary Shelley</persName> 
                        in <date when="1840">1840</date>, the letter describes &#x201C;a magnificent palace, . . . now half in ruins, . . . built upon terraces <hi rend="italic">raised from</hi> the bottom 
                        of the lake, together with its garden at the foot of a semicircular precipice, overshadowed by profound forests of <name type="botanical" corresp="#CHESTNUT">chestnut</name>. 
                        The scene from the colonnade is the most extraordinary, at once, and the most lovely that eye ever beheld. On one side is the mountain, and immediately over you are clusters of cyprus&#x2010;trees 
                        of an astonishing height, which seem to pierce the sky. Above you, from among the clouds, as it were, descends a waterfall of immense size, broken by the woody rocks into a thousand channels to the lake. 
                        On the other side is seen the blue extent of the lake and the mountains, speckled with sails and spires. The apartments of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#VILLAPLINIANA">Pliniana</placeName> 
                        are immensely large, but ill furnished and antique. The terraces, which overlook the lake, and conduct under the shade of such immense <name type="botanical" corresp="#LAUREL">laurel&#x2010;trees</name> 
                        as deserve the epithet of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PYTHIA">Pythian</persName>, are most delightful&#x201D;

                    <p>Four years after this poem, in <title type="essay" corresp="#JRPOETRYOFARCHITECTURE1837_38"><hi rend="italic">The Poetry of Architecture</hi></title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                        clung to the characterization of <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> as &#x201C;glorious in its death&#x201D;. Here the picturesque view does rise from the &#x201C;principal character of 
                        Italian landscape&#x201D; of melancholy to that of &#x201C;elevation&#x201D;; and a word picture traces &#x201C;small fountains&#x201D; such as those falling into the &#x201C;Larian Lake&#x201D; 
                        to a broader vista of &#x201C;peak, precipice, and promontory&#x201D;. Appreciation of such scenes is necessary to the object of these essays, which is the &#x201C;formation of taste&#x201D;, 
                        although later in the series Ruskin recurs to <placeName type="building" corresp="#VILLAPLINIANA">Pliniana</placeName> as an impractical model for the modern English villa, 
                        when built in hill country: &#x201C;The ﬁrst thing . . . which the architect has to do in hill country is to bring his employer down from heroics to 
                        common sense; to teach him that, although it might be very well for a man like <persName corresp="#PLINYYOUNGER">Pliny</persName>, whose whole spirit and life was wrapt up in that of Nature, 
                        to set himself down under the splash of a cascade 400 feet high, such escapades are not becoming in English gentlemen; and that it is necessary, for his own satisfaction, 
                        as well as that of others, that he should keep in the most quiet and least pretending corners of the landscape which he has chosen&#x201D;. (The editors of the 
                        <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSKLE">Library Edition</title> corrected these remarks, noting that the <placeName type="building" corresp="#VILLAPLINIANA">Pliniana</placeName> 
                        &#x201C;is not . . . on the site of that built by <persName corresp="#PLINYYOUNGER">Pliny</persName>; it is called after him from an intermittent spring which is asserted to be the one 
                        minutely described by him&#x201D; in the <title type="book" corresp="#PLINYEPISTULAE"><hi rend="italic">Epistulae</hi></title>
