                    the <geogName corresp="#LORELEI">Lorelei</geogName>. <persName corresp="#MURRAY">John Murray III</persName> explains: &#x201C;In front of the <geogName corresp="#LORELEI">Lurleiberg</geogName> is the whirlpool (Wirbel), called the Gewirr, and above it a rapid, called the Bank, 
                    formed by the stream dashing over a number of sunken rocks, encreased by the sudden bend which the river here makes. The passage of the large rafts 
                    which navigate the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> over this spot is difficult and dangerous, and men have been washed overboard by the tumultuous waves dashing over the slippery plank. 
                    The perils of this spot, taken in connexion with the mysterious echo, no doubt gave birth to the superstition that the <geogName corresp="#LORELEI"><hi rend="italic">Lurlei</hi></geogName> 
                    was haunted by a spirit, a beauteous but wicked water&#x2010;nymph, who distracted and beguiled the passing boatman with her magical voice,

                    These contrasting modes of representation and response would have been supported by the drawings completing the MS IX fair copy. According to the

                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intended to follow the headpiece depicting the &#x201C;whirlpool&#x201D; (beneath the <geogName corresp="#LORELEI">Lorelei</geogName>) with a trio of images 
                    (two set between the poem and essay, and a tailpiece): <placeName corresp="#GODESBERG">Godesberg</placeName>, <placeName type="building" corresp="#RHEINFELS">Rheinfels</placeName>, and <geogName corresp="#DRACHENFELS">Drachenfels</geogName>. 
                    In the center of these, the header for the prose essay, a drawing of <placeName type="building" corresp="#RHEINFELS">Burg Rheinfels</placeName>, 
                    the thirteenth&#x2010;century castle ruin that rises above the town of <placeName corresp="#STGOAR">St. Goar</placeName>, would have complemented 
                    the headpiece drawing of the <geogName corresp="#LORELEI">Lorelei</geogName> whirlpool below the town. Before and after the <placeName type="building" corresp="#RHEINFELS">Rheinfels</placeName> drawing, 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> planned to feature the prominences on opposite sides of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>

                    with their respective hilltop fortresses. Thus, from the station at <placeName corresp="#STGOAR">St Goar</placeName>, the illustrations (as well as the narration) 
                    point backward to the commencement of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> journey below <placeName corresp="#COLOGNE">Cologne</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#BONN">Bonn</placeName>.</p>

                    While referring to the deep sea, the drowned men may distantly allude to the legend of the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LORELEISIREN">Lorelei siren</persName>, 
                    which is noticeably absent from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem about <placeName corresp="#STGOAR">St. Goar</placeName>. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> avoids even naming the <geogName corresp="#LORELEI">Lorelei</geogName> hill, 
                    referring in the poem only to the weatherbeaten &#x201C;rock&#x201D; around which the river bends. It is possible that the Ruskins were unacquainted with the legend: 
                    although traceable to the fifteenth century, the story of the siren had been brought to life comparatively recently, in the first three decades of the nineteenth century, 
                    in poetry by <persName corresp="#CBRENTANO">Clemens Brentano</persName> (<date notBefore="1778" notAfter="1842">1778&#x2013;1842</date>), <persName corresp="#JVE">Joseph von Eichendorff</persName> (<date notBefore="1788" notAfter="1857">1788&#x2013;1857</date>), and <persName corresp="#HHEINE">Heinrich Heine</persName> (<date notBefore="1797" notAfter="1856">1797&#x2013;1856</date>); and the popularization of <persName corresp="#HHEINE">Heine</persName>&#x02BC;s poem in art song, 
                    particularly the settings by <persName corresp="#FSILCHER">Friedrich Silcher</persName> (<date notBefore="1789" notAfter="1860">1789&#x2013;1860</date>) and by <persName corresp="#FLISZT">Franz Liszt</persName> (<date notBefore="1811" notAfter="1886">1811&#x2013;86</date>), lay in the later <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date> and <date notBefore="1840" notAfter="1849">1840s</date>

                    Nonetheless, it seems surprising that the Ruskins could have escaped notice of what <persName corresp="#FMT">Frances Trollope</persName>, 
                    traveling the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> in the same year, described as &#x201C;the celebrated <geogName corresp="#LORELEI">Lurleyberg</geogName>, amidst whose inaccessible caverns dwells, as the neighbouring peasantry believe to this day,
