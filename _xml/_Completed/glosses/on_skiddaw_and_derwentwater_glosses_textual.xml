                    <ref type="witness" target="play_msii.php">&#x201C;Play&#x201D;</ref>, which could be interpreted as a metamark, a commentary on the act of composition 
                    of the poem, although forming no part of the text of the poem (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="editorial_rationale_note.php#METAMARKS">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology: Element, Attribute, and Value Usage&#x2014;Metamarks</ref>). 
                    Since the word &#x201C;Play&#x201D; is capitalized and roughly centered at the top of a page, however, the word can also be interpreted, 
                    and perhaps more persuasively, as a title. As such, it may represent <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s first attempt at composing what became

                    The solitary and deleted line below the title is not attributed to a speaker, and it does not appear in the play as fair&#x2010;copied; 
                    however, the line might represent a start on dialogue spoken by one of the French characters in the play. The fair copy of the play 
                    appears along with the fair copy of the poem, <ref type="witness" target="on_skiddaw_and_derwent_water_msv.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATERMSV">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D;</title></ref>,

                    it is superfluous to the meter of the lines preceding and following it, and its position at the left margin suggests neither

                    which was octosyllabic, but provided an imperfect rhyme of &#x201C;falls&#x201D; for &#x201C;call&#x201D; in the following line. Ruskin therefore revised the line 
                    to the version found in the fair copy, &#x201C;Which from thy mountain head doth fall&#x201D;, which is also correctly octosyllabic, but the line appears confused in the draft. 
                    Ruskin deleted &#x201C;highest&#x201D; and substituted &#x201C;head&#x201D; above, appearing to create the nonsense phrase, &#x201C;head mountain&#x201D;, 
                    but in fact intending &#x201C;head&#x201D; to follow &#x201C;mountain&#x201D; as an above&#x2010;the&#x2010;line runover, forming &#x201C;mountain head&#x201D;. Finally, at the end of the line, he deleted the <hi rend="italic">s</hi> on &#x201C;falls&#x201D; 
                    and squeezed &#x201C;doth&#x201D; in front of &#x201C;fall&#x201D;.</p></note>
