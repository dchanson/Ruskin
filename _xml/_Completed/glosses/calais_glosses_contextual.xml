                    guidebooks, which began appearing in <date when="1836">1836</date>, were not free from apodictic judgments about the superior good sense of the British, this sentiment about the wide differences 
                    between the &#x201C;races&#x201D; of the British and the French seems more typical of English observers arriving shortly after the victory at <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName> 
                    than of English tourists arriving almost two decades after the reopening of the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName> 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PARSONSWORTHTHEDETOUR"><persName corresp="#NTP">Parsons</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#PARSONSWORTHTHEDETOUR"><hi rend="italic">Worth the Detour</hi></title></ref>, 184&#x2013;88). 
                    For example, writing about his Continental tour of <date when="1817">1817</date>, the <placeName corresp="#LIVERPOOL">Liverpool</placeName> <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregational</orgName> minister, 
                    <persName corresp="#TRAFFLES">Thomas Raffles</persName> (<date notBefore="1788" notAfter="1863">1788&#x2013;1863</date>), described his culture shock when coming in view of the port at <placeName corresp="#DIEPPE">Dieppe</placeName>: 
                    &#x201C;the land I had so ardently desired to see&#x2014;the people with whom I had longed to mingle&#x2014;the habits and the manners I had often contemplated at a distance, were now before me&#x201D;. 
                    The first encounter shook him, as &#x201C;multitudes&#x201D; of women efficiently lent their arms to pull the English vessel into harbor: 
                    &#x201C;Their dress&#x2014;their language&#x2014;their manners&#x2014;their whole appearance, was quite new, and we felt in a moment that we were in a foreign land. It is scarcely 
                    conceivable that so few miles and hours should make so vast a difference in one&#x02BC;s feelings, and completely excite all that can be conveyed by the word <hi rend="italic">foreigner</hi> 
                    in the bosom. It was not a little strange to hear a language which we had been accustomed to associate with every idea of polish and of elegance, 
                    chattered with amazing volubility by the motley group collected on the quay to witness our arrival&#x201D;.</p>
                    
                    <p>If the French women disconcerted <persName corresp="#TRAFFLES">Raffles</persName>, the &#x201C;military men&#x201D; idly &#x201C;sauntering&#x201D; on the quay failed to &#x201C;excite a very favourable impression in my mind 
                        of the French military character or costume. Their dress was extremely mean and slovenly&#x201D;, and one &#x201C;looked in vain for that bold and manly air&#x2014;that dignified and 
                        noble independence, which are the usual indications of bravery, and generally associated with the profession of a soldier. . . . Are these, thought I, 
                        the men that have made monarchs tremble on their thrones, and kept the world in awe&#x2014;were they such men as these that bore the eagles of <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName> 
                        to the gates of <placeName corresp="#VIENNA">Vienna</placeName>, and reaped the laurels of <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> on the fields of <placeName corresp="#AUSTERLITZ">Austerlitz</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#MARENGO">Marengo</placeName>&#x201D;?</p>
                    
                    <p>Finally, it was brought home to <persName corresp="#TRAFFLES">Raffles</persName>&#x02BC;s traveling party that they had arrived &#x201C;in a Catholic country&#x201D; by the erection &#x201C;on the pier&#x201D; of an &#x201C;immense crucifix of wood&#x201D;, 
                        on which &#x201C;the image of the Saviour is as large as life, with the <persName corresp="#VIRGINMARY">Virgin Mary</persName> weeping at his feet. At this image, our pilot&#x2014;a hardy, muscular old man, 
                        whose robust figure and weather&#x2010;beaten countenance would form a fine subject for the pencil, crossed himself as he stood at the helm, and the vessel passed along&#x201D;

                    (&#x201C;a little France, a miniature picture&#x201D;). Similarly, in her journal of the tour, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_mary_note.php"><persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName></ref> 
                    framed a picturesque view: &#x201C;much pleased with the appearance of <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName> from the sea&#x201D;

                    As guidebooks and travel accounts of the period shifted to more practical advice about arrival in Continental towns 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PARSONSWORTHTHEDETOUR"><persName corresp="#NTP">Parsons</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#PARSONSWORTHTHEDETOUR"><hi rend="italic">Worth the Detour</hi></title></ref>, 180&#x2013;84), 
                    <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName> was sized up in terms of British travelers&#x02BC; complaints about difficulties in negotiating customs and finding lodging; see, for example,

                    Whereas <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s account turns the abrupt transition from English character to French, separated only by the <geogName corresp="#ENGLISHCHANNEL">Channel</geogName> crossing, into a topic for picturesque contrasts of scenery and costume, 
                    <persName corresp="#JM">John Murray III</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1836">1836</date> guidebook emphasizes the comforts of familiarity: <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName> &#x201C;is half Anglicised and our language is generally spoken&#x201D;

                    fixation on the picturesque feature of &#x201C;peculiarly french&#x201D; fishing boats, there is also perhaps a reflection of the most picturesque image in 
                    <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, the &#x201C;passage&#x2010;boat [that] swept gaily by, / Laden with peasant&#x2010;girls

                    however, is the older poet&#x02BC;s crowded historical references. <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> uses the trope of the city gate to allude to the story in the

                    (MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2)&#x2014;</hi>Steamers from <geogName corresp="#DOVERCLF">Dover</geogName> to <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName> averaged, according to <persName corresp="#JM">John Murray</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1836">1836</date> guidebook, 
                    two&#x2010;and&#x2010;a&#x2010;half hours for the crossing  
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book for Travellers on the Continent</hi></title></ref>, 86). 
                    This was the time required for the Ruskins&#x02BC; crossing, <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName> commenting: &#x201C;two hours and a half exactly in crossing and just saved the tide 
                    so that we all landed at the pier, without having recourse to small boats&#x201D;

                    Unless a return crossing (which is what <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;four hours&#x201D; estimates) did require a longer time, 
                    his narrator is mistaken; and in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> version <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                    substituted &#x201C;half an hours&#x02BC;&#x201D; crossing&#x2014;a change that did not improve on the accuracy of &#x201C;four hours&#x201D;, 
                    but that captured the tone he desired for his narrator.</p>
                    
                    <p>From the <placeName type="building" corresp="#TOWEROFLONDON">Tower of London</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName>, the trip lasted twelve hours,
