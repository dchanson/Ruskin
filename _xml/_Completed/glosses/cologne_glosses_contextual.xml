                    of <persName corresp="#PPR">Peter Paul Rubens</persName> (<date notBefore="1577" notAfter="1640">1577&#x2013;1640</date>) has been disputed since the seventeenth century, 
                    when writers made claims for both <placeName corresp="#ANTWERP">Antwerp</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#COLOGNE">Cologne</placeName>. 
                    The controversy became heated in <date when="1853">1853</date>, thirty years after the Ruskins&#x02BC; visit, 
                    when a Dutch historian uncovered a story about <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName>&#x02BC;s father, who was arrested for an adulterous affair with <persName corresp="#AOS">Anna of Saxony</persName>, imprisoned, 
                    and then sent to <placeName corresp="#SIEGEN">Siegen</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#WESTPHALIA">Westphalia</placeName>, 
                    where he lived under conditions of house arrest. He was joined in <date when="1573">1573</date> by his wife and children, who had been living in <placeName corresp="#COLOGNE">Cologne</placeName>. According to this account, 
                    the family stayed in <placeName corresp="#SIEGEN">Siegen</placeName> until <date when="1578">1578</date>, a year after <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName>&#x02BC;s birth, and then they returned to <placeName corresp="#COLOGNE">Cologne</placeName>, 
                    where <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName> spent his boyhood until <date when="1589">1589</date>. In that year, his father died, and the family relocated to <placeName corresp="#ANTWERP">Antwerp</placeName>. 
                    These revelations of the affair in the nineteenth century&#x2014;far from settling the question of <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName>&#x02BC;s birthplace, by placing the event logically in <placeName corresp="#SIEGEN">Siegen</placeName>&#x2014;only 
                    fired the respective champions of <placeName corresp="#COLOGNE">Cologne</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#ANTWERP">Antwerp</placeName> to defend their claims. Scholarly debate on the subject persists to the present day, but the most persuasive arguments 
                    point to <placeName corresp="#SIEGEN">Siegen</placeName>.</p>
                    
                    <p><placeName corresp="#COLOGNE">Cologne</placeName> may have become known as the birthplace not only because <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName> definitely grew up there, 
                    but also because his mother connived at identifying the city as the family&#x02BC;s continuous residence prior to her husband&#x02BC;s death and the move to <placeName corresp="#ANTWERP">Antwerp</placeName>. 
                    She had strong motives to suppress the family&#x02BC;s associations with <placeName corresp="#SIEGEN">Siegen</placeName>, since exposure of the scandal of her husband&#x02BC;s love affair 
                    would have disastrously damaged her family&#x02BC;s fortunes. The house in <placeName corresp="#COLOGNE">Cologne</placeName> that was marked 
                    for tourists as the birthplace was the <placeName type="building" corresp="#GRONSFELDERHOF">Gronsfelder Hof</placeName>, no. 10, in the <placeName corresp="#STERNENGASSE">Sternengasse</placeName>, a mansion that was also known for providing a refuge for 
                    <persName corresp="#MDM">Marie de&#x02BC; Medici</persName> in the final years of her exile from the French court

                    The <persName corresp="#MDM">French queen</persName> was a major patron of <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName>, as was another seventeenth&#x2010;century resident of the <placeName corresp="#STERNENGASSE">Sternengasse</placeName>, the important collector 
                    <persName corresp="#EJIV">Everhard Jabach IV</persName>.

                    <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName> painted this harrowing work for the high altar of the church in which he was probably confirmed as a boy, and in which his father was entombed. 
                    In the picture, <persName corresp="#STPETER">Peter</persName> is martyred by being nailed by his feet and hands while being hung upside down on a cross. 
                    While the personal connections were compelling for <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName>, with <persName corresp="#STPETER">Peter</persName>&#x02BC;s upside&#x2010;down cross effectively pointing at his father&#x02BC;s tomb, 
                    the commission came from the collector, <persName corresp="#EVJIV">Everhard Jabach IV</persName>, who was interested more in creating an epitaph 
                        for his own father. A tradition relayed by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, therefore, that <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName> 
                        &#x201C;bequeathed . . . [the altarpiece] at his death to his native city&#x201D; 
                        is not accurate. Nonetheless, <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName> overrode his patron&#x02BC;s suggestions for more dignified subjects 
                        from <persName corresp="#STPETER">Peter</persName>&#x02BC;s life in favor of this scene. 
                        Along with any personal significance the subject may have held for <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName>, artistic fame was also connected with the subject, 
                        which had prompted competition among painters in the sixteenth and the earlier seventeenth centuries 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SAUERLANDERCATHOLICRUBENS"><persName corresp="#WSAUERLANDER">Sauerl&#x00E4;nder</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#SAUERLANDERCATHOLICRUBENS"><hi rend="italic">The Catholic Rubens</hi></title></ref>, 219&#x2013;32). 
                    The upside&#x2010;down crucifixion of <persName corresp="#STPETER">Peter</persName> was the subject also of <persName corresp="#MAA">Michelangelo</persName>&#x02BC;s last painting,

                    <p><persName corresp="SJR">Joshua Reynolds</persName> did not admire <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="artwork" corresp="#RUBENSCRUCIFIXIONSTPETER"><hi rend="italic">Crucifixion</hi></title> 
                        in particular, although his appraisal of <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName> overall gradually rose in estimation. 
                    In <title type="book" corresp="#REYNOLDSJOURNEY"><hi rend="italic">A Journey to Flanders and Holland</hi></title> (<date when="1797">1797</date>), <persName corresp="SJR">Reynolds</persName> 
                    acknowledged that <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName> expressed &#x201C;his own approbation of this picture&#x201D;, which was &#x201C;painted a little time 
                    before <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName>&#x02BC;s death&#x201D;, and which the painter declared &#x201C;the best he ever painted&#x201D;. Thanks to this comment, 
                    the painting held &#x201C;great fame&#x201D;, <persName corresp="SJR">Reynolds</persName> admitted, and he traveled from <placeName corresp="#DUSSELDORF">D&#x00FC;sseldorf</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#COLOGNE">Cologne</placeName> 
                    &#x201C;on purpose to see it; but it by no means recompenced us for our journey&#x201D;, for he considered parts of the figure &#x201C;ill drawn, or rather in a bad taste of drawing&#x201D;. 
                    &#x201C;Many parts of this picture are so feebly drawn, and with so tame a pencil, that I cannot help suspecting that <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName> died before he had cmpleted it, 
                    and that it was finished by some of his scholars&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#REYNOLDSWORKS1797">Reynolds, <title type="book" corresp="#REYNOLDSWORKS1797"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title> [<date when="1797">1797</date>]</ref>, 2:111). 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears unacquainted with this opinion; and indeed, the Ruskins may have been responding primarily to the fame bestowed on the painting 
                        by <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName>&#x02BC;s own assessment of it. Another influence besides traditions presented to tourists was changing taste: 
                    the huge flow of Old Master paintings into <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> during the Napoleonic era had shifted taste from neoclassicism 
                    to &#x201C;the warmth and colour of Venetian, Dutch, and Flemish masters&#x201D;

                    personalized as the <hi rend="italic">rubenistes</hi> versus the <hi rend="italic">poussinistes</hi>, although <persName corresp="#JRE">Richardson</persName> listed <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName> as a master in both categories.

                    (<date notBefore="1769" notAfter="1790">1769&#x2013;90</date>), frames his discussion in the same terms of <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName> versus <persName corresp="#NP">Poussin</persName>, but he finds <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName> wanting both in composition and coloring. 
                    In composition, <persName corresp="#SJR">Reynolds</persName> asserts in Discourse 5, his &#x201C;art is too apparent&#x201D;, his figures exhibiting &#x201C;expression&#x201D; and &#x201C;energy&#x201D;, but lacking &#x201C;simplicity and dignity&#x201D;; and in coloring, there is 
                    &#x201C;too much of what we call tinted&#x201D;. In what perhaps comes closest in the <title type="book" corresp="#REYNOLDSDISCOURSES"><hi rend="italic">Discourses</hi></title> to the criticism relayed by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in <title type="essay" corresp="JRCOLOGNEPROSE">&#x201C;Cologne&#x201D;</title>, <persName corresp="#SJR">Reynolds</persName> believes that, 
                    in the &#x201C;higher walks of painting&#x201D; (i.e., history and religious painting), <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName> failed in a &#x201C;nicety of distinction and elegance of mind&#x201D;. 
                    Despite these detractions, <persName corresp="#SJR">Reynolds</persName> regarded <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName>&#x02BC;s work overall as &#x201C;a remarkable instance of the same mind being seen in all the various parts of the art&#x201D; 
                    so that &#x201C;whilst his works continue before us, . . . his deficiencies are fully supplied&#x201D;.</p>
                    
                    <p>In <date when="1781">1781</date>, when <persName corresp="#SJR">Reynolds</persName> took a tour of the <placeName corresp="#LOWCOUNTRIES">Low Countries</placeName>, his estimation of <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName> was raised by observing more of the painter&#x02BC;s work. 
                    The change is summarized in <title type="essay" corresp="#REYNOLDSRUBENS">&#x201C;Character of Rubens&#x201D;</title>, an essay within <persName corresp="#SJR">Reynolds</persName>&#x02BC;s notes from the tour, which were 
                    published posthumously as <title type="book" corresp="#REYNOLDSJOURNEY"><hi rend="italic">A Journey to Flanders and Holland</hi></title> (<date when="1797">1797</date>). The &#x201C;Character of Rubens&#x201D; begins by challenging criticism 
                    with &#x201C;the works of men of genius&#x201D;, in which &#x201C;great faults are united with great beauties&#x201D;. As in Discourse 5, 
                    <persName corresp="#SJR">Reynolds</persName> understands <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName> according to &#x201C;the genius which prevails and illuminates the whole&#x201D;, but 
                    the English critic goes on to develop his ideas oppositely to the young <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s, for now he finds: &#x201C;It is only in large compositions that his [<persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName>&#x02BC;s] 
                    powers seem to have room to expand themselves. . . . His superiority is not seen in easel pictures&#x201D;&#x2014;the more intimate scale preferred by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>. 
                    <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName>&#x02BC;s best works, <persName corresp="#SJR">Reynolds</persName> goes on, 
                    &#x201C;flow with a freedom and prodigality, as if they cost him nothing&#x201D;. Respecting the traditional contest between color and line, <persName corresp="#SJR">Reynolds</persName> reflects <persName corresp="#JRE">Richardson</persName>&#x02BC;s assessment by placing <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName> high in both categories: 
                    &#x201C;The striking brilliancy of his colours, and their lively opposition to each other, the flowing liberty and freedom of his outline, and animated pencil, 
                    with which every object is touched, all contribute to awaken and keep alive the attention of the spectator&#x201D;. Thus, a view that in the <title type="book" corresp="#REYNOLDSDISCOURSES"><hi rend="italic">Discourses</hi></title> was offered as 
                    a concession, now reads as an inevitability: <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName> achieves &#x201C;the complete uniformity in all the parts of the work&#x201D;, 
                    a unity that seems to &#x201C;grow out of one mind&#x201D;. The &#x201C;confidence&#x201D; of that mind places <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName> above rules, which are &#x201C;subject to his control&#x201D;, 
                    rather than he being &#x201C;himself subject to the rules&#x201D;. His &#x201C;originality of manner&#x201D; can therefore &#x201C;be truly said to have extended the limits of the art&#x201D;.</p>
                    
                    <p>Even in the <title type="essay" corresp="#REYNOLDSRUBENS">&#x201C;Character of Rubens&#x201D;</title>, however, <persName corresp="#SJR">Reynolds</persName> admits to some shortcomings 
                        in <persName corresp="#PPR">Rubens</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;excellencies, which would have perfectly united with his style&#x201D;, and this list of failings 
                    possibly corresponds to some of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s comments in <title type="essay" corresp="JRCOLOGNEPROSE">&#x201C;Cologne&#x201D;</title>. 
                    In the figures, <persName corresp="#SJR">Reynolds</persName> finds wanting a &#x201C;poetical conception of character&#x201D;; and in his &#x201C;representations of the highest characters 
                    in the christian or the fabulous world, . . . the spectator finds little more than mere mortals, such as he meets with every day&#x201D;
