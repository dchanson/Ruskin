                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><persName corresp="#MURRAY">Murray</persName> <title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book for Travellers on the Continent</hi></title></ref>, 202).</p>
                    
                    <p>The settlements ending eighteenth&#x2010;century wars on the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName> were significant to British tradesmen like the Ruskins, <persName corresp="#LC">Linda Colley</persName> argues; 
                    merchants viewed these conflicts favorably, &#x201C;particularly before <date when="1775">1775</date>&#x201D;, as having filled &#x201C;the pockets of a multitude of [British] commercial pawns. . . . 
                    <date notBefore="1701" notAfter="1714">[T]he War of Spanish Succession</date>, the <date notBefore="1740" notAfter="1748">War of Austrian Succession</date> and, above all, the <date notBefore="1756" notAfter="1763">Seven Years War</date> seemed to many traders abundantly worthwhile&#x201D;. 
                    The <date notBefore="1756" notAfter="1763">Seven Years War</date>, especially, she says, seemed &#x201C;the high point of the interplay between commercial interests and British imperial aggression&#x201D;, 
                    as its settlement helped &#x201C;British exports [to] reach a record level&#x201D; and resulted in taking captive &#x201C;vast areas of the world&#x201D; for <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BRITONS"><persName corresp="#LC">Colley</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#BRITONS"><hi rend="italic">Britons</hi></title></ref>, 99).
                    For similar reasons, tradesmen supported the Peace of Aix&#x2010;la&#x2010;Chapelle concluding the <date notBefore="1740" notAfter="1748">War of Austrian Succession</date>.</p>
                    
                    <p>In a popular history of modern times that (in its first version of <date notBefore="1757" notAfter="1758">1757&#x2013;58</date>) 
                    ended with the latter treaty, <persName corresp="#TGS">Tobias Smollett</persName> (<date notBefore="1721" notAfter="1771">1721&#x2013;71</date>) reflects <persName corresp="#LC">Colley</persName>&#x02BC;s assessment of tradesmen&#x02BC;s views, albeit tempering the popular view with his characteristic skepticism: 
                    &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">Peace of Aix&#x2010;la&#x2010;Chapelle</hi>, however unstable or inglorious it might appear to those few who understood the interests, and felt for the honour of their country, 
                    was nevertheless not unwelcome to the nation in general. . . . The English . . . had suffered considerable losses and interruption in the article of commerce, 
                    which was the source of their national opulence and power. . . . To a people influenced by these considerations, the restoration of a free trade, [and] 
                    the respite from that anxiety and suspense which the prosecution of a war never fails to engender, . . . were advantages that sweetened the bitter draught 
                    of a dishonourable treaty, and induced the majority of the nation to acquiesce in the peace, not barely without murmuring, but even with some degree of satisfaction and applause&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SMOLLETTHISTORYOFENGLAND"><persName corresp="#TGS">Smollett</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#SMOLLETTHISTORYOFENGLAND"><hi rend="italic">History of England</hi></title></ref>, 3:218&#x2013;19; 
                    and see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GREENESMOLLETTTHEHISTORIAN"><persName corresp="#DGREENE">Greene</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#GREENESMOLLETTTHEHISTORIAN">&#x201C;Smollett the Historian&#x201D;</title></ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p><persName corresp="#LC">Colley</persName> looks to this kind of sentiment as evidence of her larger thesis that &#x201C;the relationship between the [British] trading interest on the one hand, and the landed 
                    interest that dominated the legislature and policy&#x2010;making on the other, though by no means an equal or an invariably tranquil one, was for much of the eighteenth century 
                    and after mutually beneficial. Trade was not only an indispensable part of the British economy, but also vital for the state&#x02BC;s revenue and naval power. 
                    In return, traders depended on the state for the maintenance of civil order, for sympathetic legislation, for protection in peace and war, and for access to captive markets overseas&#x201D;. 
                    Although this mutually supportive relationship between land and trade was later frayed by the protracted <date notBefore="1799-11-09" notAfter="1815-06-18">Napoleonic conflict</date>, which was costly to British trade, 
                    the relationship was for many Britons the foundation of patriotism. This was especially the case for Tory Lowland Scots like the Ruskins, whose patriotism intensified 
                    following the failed invasion in <date when="1745">1745</date> by the Young Pretender, <persName corresp="#PCES">Prince Charles Edward Stuart</persName>, who was supported by Highland Scots. 
                    Both in the midst and in the aftermath of that crisis, <persName corresp="#LC">Colley</persName> argues, 
                    <orgName corresp="#JACOBITISM">Jacobitism</orgName> was defeated not only by British <orgName corresp="#PROTESTANTISM">Protestantism</orgName> and anti&#x2010;Catholic fervor but also by fear of civil war, apprehension of loss of lives and property, 
                    and the belief that successful <orgName corresp="#JACOBITISM">Jacobitism</orgName> would lend an advantage in trade to <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BRITONS"><persName corresp="#LC">Colley</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#BRITONS"><hi rend="italic">Britons</hi></title></ref>, 71, and see 71&#x2013;85). Thus, for British travelers, 
                    Continental sites commemorating peace treaties could stir patriotism, evoking not only military pride but also the mercantile interests that underlay that patriotism.</p>
                
                    <p>At the <placeName type="building" corresp="#HOTELDEVILLEAIX">H&#x00F4;tel de Ville</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#AIXLACHAPELLE">Aix&#x2010;la&#x2010;Chapelle</placeName>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName> mentions, its grand salon was hung with &#x201C;portraits of the ministers and sovereigns who assisted&#x201D; at the negotiations of the <date notBefore="1814-11" notAfter="1815-06">Congress of Vienna</date> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><persName corresp="#MURRAY">Murray</persName> <title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book for Travellers on the Continent</hi></title></ref>, 202). 
                        The idea of a portrait collection commemorating the Congress was connected with a scheme by 
                        <persName corresp="#KG4">George</persName>, the Prince Regent (<date notBefore="1762" notAfter="1830">1762&#x2013;1830</date>), and his circle to commission the fashionable portraitist, <persName corresp="#TL">Thomas Lawrence</persName> (<date notBefore="1769" notAfter="1830">1769&#x2013;1830</date>), 
                        to paint the monarchs and major military heroes involved in the victory over <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>&#x2014;an ambitious undertaking that was finally 
                        realized in the decoration of the Waterloo Chamber at <placeName type="building" corresp="#WINDSORCAS">Windsor Castle</placeName> to display the collection. 
                        The commission led <persName corresp="#TL">Lawrence</persName> to attend the Congress at <placeName corresp="#AIXLACHAPELLE">Aix&#x2010;la&#x2010;Chapelle</placeName> in <date when="1818">1818</date>, 
                        so that he could take advantage of the gathering of monarchs and dignitaries and persuade them to sit for their portraits. For this purpose, he was assigned rooms of the 
                        <title corresp="#HOTELDEVILLEAIX">H&#x00F4;tel de Ville</title> for a studio. <persName corresp="#TL">Lawrence</persName> enlarged on the distinction thus conferred on a British artist: 
                        &#x201C;Sent here by royal command, the magistrates of a royal city, in which for centuries the Emperor has been crowned, granted me the principal gallery of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#HOTELDEVILLEAIX">Town House</placeName> 
                        for my painting&#x2010;room; and to this the three greatest monarchs in recent political importance, have condescended to come to be painted by me&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WILLIAMSLIFEOFLAWRENCE"><persName corresp="#DEW">Williams</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#WILLIAMSLIFEOFLAWRENCE"><hi rend="italic">Life and Correspondence of Sir Thomas Lawrence</hi></title></ref>, 2:119). 
                        None of <persName corresp="#TL">Lawrence</persName>&#x02BC;s portraits for this commission would have remained at <placeName corresp="#AIXLACHAPELLE">Aix&#x2010;la&#x2010;Chapelle</placeName>, unless the collection included mezzotints based on them; 
                        in fact, at his death, <persName corresp="#TL">Lawrence</persName> retained the portraits that would only later be assembled at <placeName type="building" corresp="#WINDSORCAS">Windsor Castle</placeName>. Nonetheless, the episode 
                        at <placeName corresp="#AIXLACHAPELLE">Aix&#x2010;la&#x2010;Chapelle</placeName>, along with <persName corresp="#TL">Lawrence</persName>&#x02BC;s further travels and commissions on the Continent, was influential in giving a boost 
                        to the reputation of English art in Europe&#x2014;a reputation that reached a high&#x2010;water mark with the so&#x2010;called <orgName corresp="#SALON">&#x201C;English Salon&#x201D;</orgName> of <date when="1824">1824</date>, which included <persName corresp="#TL">Lawrence</persName>&#x02BC;s portraits along with 
                        <persName corresp="#CONSTABLEARTIST">John Constable</persName>&#x02BC;s (<date notBefore="1776" notAfter="1837">1776&#x2013;1837</date>) landscapes. 
                        By <date when="1827">1827</date>, the loose &#x201C;English manner&#x201D; of painting was championed by the French Romantics, especially by <persName corresp="#FVED">Eug&#x00E8;ne Delacroix</persName> 
                        (<date notBefore="1798" notAfter="1863">1798&#x2013;1863</date>), over the objections of the French neoclassicists

                    Two, as suggested by the ambiguous punctuation following &#x201C;Last Judgment&#x201D; and &#x201C;I think&#x201D;&#x2014;points that appear to function as pause&#x2010;periods (see

                    but that may indicate full&#x2010;stops&#x2014;his expression of uncertainty, &#x201C;I think&#x201D;, may apply either to the missing artist&#x02BC;s name or to the location of the work,
