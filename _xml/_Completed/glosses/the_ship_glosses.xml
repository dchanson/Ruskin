                    The wreck from this disaster, which occurred in <date when="1782">1782</date>, remained a danger in the shipping channel until divers were organized in <date notBefore="1839" notAfter="1844">1839-44</date> to salvage 
                    remains (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKISLEOFWIGHT1888"><hi rend="italic">Handbook for Travellers in Surrey, Hampshire, and the Isle of Wight</hi></ref>, 211&#x2013;12). 
                    In his poem, Ruskin imagines the ship in its prime, her &#x0201C;huge sails&#x0201D; destined to play &#x0201C;a traitor&#x02019;s part&#x0201D; in the future.<lb/>
                    
                    This disaster remained famous throughout the nineteenth century, with accounts framed in terms of nationalistic pride and grief. 
                    An early account, as <persName corresp="#HGV">Helen Viljoen</persName> notes, is included in 
                    <title type="book" corresp="#PENNANTJOURNEY"><hi rend="italic">A Journey from London to the Isle of Wight</hi></title> (<date when="1801">1801</date>) 
                    by <persName corresp="#TPNATURALIST">Thomas Pennant</persName> (<date notBefore="1726" notAfter="1798">1726&#x2013;98</date>). In 17xx, 
                    when crossing to the <placeName corresp="#ISLEOFWIGHT">Isle of Wight</placeName>, <persName corresp="#TPNATURALIST">Pennant</persName> beheld &#x201C;the melancholy sight of the top-masts of the <name type="vessel" corresp="#ROYALGEORGE"><hi rend="italic">Royal George</hi></name>,&#x201D; 
                    once deemed &#x201C;the best sailer in the navy,&#x201D; which, &#x201C;before she grew old, carried the heaviest metal; . . . the tallest masts and squarest canvas of any <hi rend="italic">English</hi> 
                    built ship in the service. She was coveted by every Admiral, and therefore was engaged in more actions than any other.&#x201D; Pennant attributes the loss to &#x201C;the zeal of the spirited 
                    Admiral for returning with all possible speed to the service of his country,&#x201D; leading to reckless navigation that caused the ship to capsize, taking the lives of 
                    &#x201C;four hundred seamen, and about the same number of women and children, who had taken the opportunity of the inactive state of the ship, to visit their friends&#x201D;

                    Blame is also suppressed in a poem by <persName corresp="#WCP">William Cowper</persName> (<date notBefore="1731" notAfter="1800">1731&#x2013;1800</date>),
