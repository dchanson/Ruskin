                    The town of <placeName corresp="#LECCO">Lecco</placeName> lies at the bottom of the eastern leg of <geogName corresp="#LAKECOMO">Lake Como</geogName>, corresponding to the town of <placeName corresp="#COMO">Como</placeName> lying at the bottom of the western leg. 
                    The latter was the Ruskins&#x02BC; ultimate destination. As they set out steaming southward on the lake in the &#x201C;morning mild&#x201D;, they did not turn at the fork toward the eastern leg and <placeName corresp="#LECCO">Lecco</placeName>, 
                    but disembarked from the steamboat and were rowed to their resting place at <placeName corresp="#CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</placeName> on the western bank, which they reached at four o&#x02BC;clock in the afternoon. 
                    By referring at the start of the poem to the morning breaking over <placeName corresp="#LECCO">Lecco</placeName>, and closing with &#x201C;sunwaves&#x201D;&#x2014;altered in draft by the insertion of &#x201C;sun&#x2010;red waves&#x201D;&#x2014;<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                    frames the poem as if contained in a single day, but in fact the journey from <placeName corresp="#CHIAVENNA">Chiavenna</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#COMO">Como</placeName> extended from Saturday to Monday, 15&#x2013;17 June, with Monday devoted to excursions 
                    from the family&#x02BC;s base in <placeName corresp="#CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</placeName>, as explained in the following gloss. The sunrise&#x2010;to&#x2010;sunset frame of the poem is also geographical, spanning the eastern leg to the western leg of the lake. 
                    <persName corresp="#MWS">Mary Shelley</persName> uses the same trope in a striking paragraph of <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SHELLEYRAMBLES"><persName corresp="#MWS">Shelley</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#SHELLEYRAMBLES"><hi rend="italic">Rambles in Germany and Italy</hi></title></ref>,

                    <p>In nineteenth&#x2010;century British travel guides, as now, the eastern leg of <geogName corresp="#LAKECOMO">Lake Como</geogName> is often called <geogName corresp="#LAKELECCO">Lake Lecco</geogName>. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s phrase, &#x201C;<geogName corresp="#MOUNTRESEGONE">Lecco mountains</geogName>&#x201D;, however, is poetic; the mountain that rises above <placeName corresp="#LECCO">Lecco</placeName> 
                        is <geogName corresp="#MONTERESEGONE">Monte Resegone</geogName>, &#x201C;distinguished by the saw&#x2010;like form of its crest against the sky&#x201D;, as implied in its name

                        According to the <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php#ACCOUNTTOCCADENABBIAILLUS"><title type="bibliography_text" corresp="JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">List of Proposed Additional Contents for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;&#x2014;Illustrations</title></ref>,

                        <geogName corresp="#MOUNTRESEGONE">Resegone</geogName> rising above <placeName corresp="#LECCO">Lecco</placeName>. The mountain is visible as one sails down the lake toward <placeName corresp="#BELLAGIO">Bellagio</placeName>, before turning toward the western bank; and it can be seen even from <placeName corresp="#CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</placeName> on the western bank, 
                        rising above the promontory of <placeName corresp="#BELLAGIO">Bellagio</placeName>, as <persName corresp="#MWS">Mary Shelley</persName> remarked, its crest calling to her mind scenes from <persName corresp="#AMANZONI">Manzoni</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#MANZONIPROMESSISPOSI"><hi rend="italic">I Promessi Sposi</hi></title> (<date when="1827">1827</date>)

                        A path led to the summit above the village, &#x201C;command[ing] the <geogName corresp="#LAKELECCO">Lecco&#x2010;branch</geogName>, widely sweeping beyond the promontory of <placeName corresp="#BELLAGIO">Bellagio</placeName>, 
                        and the glorious sight of the high <geogName corresp="#GRISONS">Alps of the Grisons</geogName> and the <geogName corresp="#VALTELLINA">Valtellina</geogName> displaying from afar 
                        their granite peaks and glacier summits&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MAZZONIMILAN"><persName corresp="#MMAZZONI">Mazzoni</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#MAZZONIMILAN"><hi rend="italic">The Traveller&#x02BC;s Guide of Milan</hi></title></ref>, 115). 
                        The Ruskins would also have been able to look back on this region by sighting the crest of <geogName corresp="#MOUNTRESEGONE">Resegone</geogName> from atop <name type="building" corresp="#DUOMOMILAN">Milan Cathedral</name> (see 
                        <ref type="witness" target="milan_cathedral_poem_msviii.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRMILANCATHEDRAL">&#x201C;Milan Cathedral&#x201D;</title></ref> and its contextual glosses).</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> does not describe the village of <placeName corresp="#CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</placeName> itself in the poem. He probably found too little excitment in its most attractive feature, which since the eighteenth century had consisted in 
                        accommodations outside of the larger cities that English travelers could consider as &#x201C;clean as in <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>&#x201D;, its people &#x201C;civil and <hi rend="italic">honest</hi>&#x201D;, and cookery worthy of a diplomat. 
                        &#x201C;Did you think there existed such a place in <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>?&#x201D; So wrote the well&#x2010;traveled bear&#x2010;leader <persName corresp="#TBRAND">Thomas Brand</persName> ([<date notBefore="1751" notAfter="1814">1751&#x2013;1814</date>], quoted from a <date when="1791">1791</date> letter, in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BLACKITALY"><persName corresp="#JBLACK">Black</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#BLACKITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy and the Grand Tour</hi></title></ref>, 69). 
                        A more nuanced study of the village and its hotel life was written by <persName corresp="#MWS">Mary Shelley</persName> during her long stay in <date when="1840">1840</date>, an account attuned to the daily life of the people, ordinary objects, and peace of the surroundings.</p></note>

                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> is referring to an excursion that the family made to the eastern shores of the lake on Monday, 17 June, after spending Saturday night and Sunday at <placeName corresp="#CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</placeName>; 
                    then, as poem explains in conclusion, the family &#x201C;launched&#x201D; back across the lake to their hotel, and rowed south to <placeName corresp="#COMO">Como</placeName>, taking in even more sights along the way. The sight on the opposite shore that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                    describes most particularly in the poem can be identified in <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName>&#x02BC;s diary account as the &#x201C;torrent&#x201D; <geogName corresp="#FIUMELATTE">Fiumelatte</geogName>, 
                    which cascades into the lake below <placeName corresp="#VARENNA">Varenna</placeName>, on the <placeName corresp="#LECCO">Lecco</placeName> side of the lake (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</title></ref>, 43). 
                    This is the &#x201C;cold stream&#x201D; that issues &#x201C;darkling&#x201D; from a subterranean source, in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s lines. <persName corresp="#JCEDITOR">Josiah Conder</persName> (<date notBefore="1789" notAfter="1855">1789&#x2013;1855</date>), 
                    the writer and compiler of the <title type="series" corresp="#CONDERMODERNTRAVELLER">&#x201C;Modern Traveller&#x201D;</title> series of travel accounts, highlights this cascade in the series&#x02BC; <date when="1831">1831</date> volume on <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>: 
                    &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">Fiume di Latte</hi> (so called from the milky colour of the water) is one of the wonders of the lake, being an intermittent stream, and, according to some Italian antiquaries, 
                    the one which <persName corresp="#PLINYYOUNGER">the younger Pliny</persName> refers to as being in the neighbourhood of his residence. . . . The <geogName corresp="FIUMELATTE">Fiume di Latte</geogName> intermits wholly during the winter, 
                    running only from March to September. It increases by degrees till it reaches its utmost height, and then decreases again till its bed again becomes dry. 
                    There seems to be no reason to doubt that its semi&#x2010;annual course is occasioned by the melting of the snows in the higher mountains, though the length of the subterranean channel through which it flows is unknown. 
                    Its excessive coldness is in favour of the supposition, that it is fed by some distant glacier; and its milky colour indicates that it has found or forced a channel through some limestone or calcareous formation. 
                    It bursts forth with great impetuosity from its subterranean channel, tumbling down a broken declivity of nearly a thousand feet into the lake&#x201D;

                    Mary Shelley could hear the &#x201C;hollow roar of the mysterious torrent . . . borne, softened by distance, from the opposite shore&#x201D;, when seated in the calm of evening at the lakeside in <placeName corresp="#CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</placeName>

                    <p><persName corresp="#JCEDITOR">Conder</persName> disputes the association of the <geogName corresp="#FIUMELATTE">Fiumelatte</geogName> with <persName corresp="#PLINYYOUNGER">Pliny</persName>; and the Ruskins likewise looked elsewhere for this classical location; see

                        Also in connection with the <geogName corresp="#FIUMELATTE">Fiumelatte</geogName>, <persName corresp="#JCEDITOR">Conder</persName> quotes from the popular travel account of the Continent, <title type="book" corresp="#MATTHEWSDIARYINVALID"><hi rend="italic">Diary of an Invalid</hi></title> (<date when="1820">1820</date>), by

Relevant to the trope of describing the expanse of the lake, <persName corresp="#HMATTHEWS">Matthews</persName> orients the traveler to the waterfall as a checkpoint, 
                        when sitting in a boat on the lake. Oppposite this &#x201C;romantic little waterfall&#x201D;, he writes, &#x201C;there is a spot . . . from which you command a prospect of the whole scene&#x201D;. 
                        Without having to climb to &#x201C;a bird&#x02BC;s&#x2010;eye view&#x201D;, which <persName corresp="#HMATTHEWS">Matthews</persName> regards as a &#x201C;disadvantage&#x201D;, one has &#x201C;the three branches of the lake under your eye at once&#x201D;
