                    and the <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName> firm of <orgName corresp="#CONSTABLEPUBLISHER">Constable</orgName> demoted to second place (see

                    and on the rivalry of the two firms for control over <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY"><hi rend="italic">The Monastery</hi></title>, see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FIELDINGMONASTERYESSAYONTHETEXT"><persName corresp="#PFIELDING">Fielding</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="FIELDINGMONASTERYESSAYONTHETEXT">&#x201c;Essay on the Text&#x201d;</title></ref>, 355&#x2013;64). 
                    The <orgName corresp="#LONGMAN">Longman</orgName> first edition divided the text into three volumes, each divided by chapters, with the chapter numbering starting anew with each volume. 
                    The running heads&#x2014;though set in small capitals, similarly to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s imitation in <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref>&#x2014;are formed solely from the title of the novel 
                    and do not change with volumes and chapters. Finally, the page number is set on the same baseline as the running head, alternating right to left 
                    with recto and verso, and not centered beneath the running head as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> devises.</p>
                    
                    <p>If <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> imitated any publication in particular, he apparently modeled his layout on a poem divided into books, 
                        and formatted with marginal line numbering. If so, the model was not from <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s poems, which are divided into cantos, not books; 
                        and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s layout does not resemble that used by the <orgName corresp="#CONSTABLEPUBLISHER">Constable</orgName> firm and the printer, <persName corresp="#JAMESBALLANTYNE">James Ballantyne</persName>, 
                        which produced the editions of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s poems owned by the Ruskins prior to 1830 (see

                    (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>)&#x2014;</hi>This twelve&#x2010;line group, starting with 
                    &#x201c;<persName type="fictional" corresp="#MTACKET">martin</persName> took his task as guide&#x201d;, appears on the verso of the manuscript,

                    The line group is placed at the beginning of the <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> transcription because it was evidently composed prior to the lines on the recto, and because these lines 
                    precede and flow into the lines on the recto, without any intervening text, according to the corresponding fair copy of this passage in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>. 
                    For a detailed description and reconstruction of the sequence of composition of the text contained in this manuscript, see the 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="monastery_apparatus.php#COMPPUB2-DRAFT"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>: Apparatus&#x2014;Stage Two of Composition: Surviving Draft</ref>. On the verso, 
                    apart from three lines positioned at the top of the page (lines 60&#x2013;62 as fair&#x2010;copied), which were evidently composed at the end of the process, 
                    the line group on this side of the manuscript consists, in order of appearance, of lines 20&#x2013;21, 14&#x2013;19, and 22&#x2013;25 
                    as numbered in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair copy.</p>
                    
                    <p>The displacement of lines 21&#x2013;22 from the order in which they are found in fair copy cannot be adequately explained 
                        owing to damage to the edges of this draft manuscript, which caused gaps in the text. In the manuscript&#x02bc;s original state, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have indicated that lines 20&#x2013;21 were to be inserted 
                        in the place that they occupy in fair copy, or he may have decided on this change during the process of fair copying. 
                        The former hypothesis might explain the presence of the horizontal rule, which divides these two lines from the remainder of the text. 
                        On the recto, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> used such a rule along with a metamark to indicate that a verse line adjacent to the rule 
                        was to be inserted in another place in the text. Metamarks may have been lost with the damage to the verso text, 
                        which would have confirmed that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> likewise intended a transposition here, as well.</p></note>

                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> adds punctuation, perhaps in part to compensate for the confusion he introduces with the possibility of reading <hi rend="italic">let</hi> as a word, 
                    rather than as the second syllable of <hi rend="italic">outlet</hi>. At this stage in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s developing penmanship for fair&#x2010;copying, 
                    he rarely used punctuation as an ongoing rhetorical and grammatical feature, reserving punctuation marks as a separate overlay on the already fair&#x2010;copied text.

                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had trouble with the word.

                <note xml:id="AVENELSFATEGLOSS" resp="#DCH"><p><hi rend="bold">&#x201c;but it was great avenels fate / . . . / to have a spirit in their line&#x201d; 
                    (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>)&#x2014;</hi>This 
                    passage underwent considerable revision in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> draft, <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIAA1">&#x201c;come on good horse and let us see&#x201d;</title>. 
                    In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, the passage is interpreted in documentary XML markup as two substitutions, one simple and a second complex&#x2014;the latter subdivided into three actions. 
                    This note comments on possible interpretations of the sequence of those actions.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the first substitution, contained in the line &#x201c;but it was great <orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">avenel</orgName>s fate&#x201d;, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                        replaced a deleted word with &#x201c;great&#x201d;, which he wrote in the right margin. The deleted word is nearly illegible but appears to be &#x201c;gay&#x201d;.</p>
                    
                    <p>The second, more complex substitution involves several rejected and substituted lines. The sequence of this process of revision 
                        is open to at least three variable interpretations, though the documentary evidence of the component deletions and additions is clear, and 
                        can be subdivided into distinct actions, which lead clearly to the outcome in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair&#x2010;copy passage of the <title type="poem" corresp="#JRMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Following &#x201c;but it was great <orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">avenel</orgName>s fate&#x201d;, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> composed two lines, 
                        &#x201c;to see things that nobody saw / except themselves, and would say pshaw&#x201d;. To obtain this account of the haunting of the <orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">House of Avenel</orgName>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> temporarily departed from the Halloween episode in <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s chapter 3 that he was mainly summarizing, in order to draw from a gossipy exchange 
                        between <persName type="fictional" corresp="#ELSPETGLENDINNING">Elspet Glendinning</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TTACKET">Tibb Tacket</persName> in chapter 4, in which <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TTACKET">Tibb</persName> boasts about spirits like the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WHITELADY">White Maiden of Avenel</persName> that are peculiarly attached 
                        to &#x201c;&#x2018;great ancient families&#x2019;&#x201d; like the <orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">Avenels</orgName>. From this exchange, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> borrowed dialogue that can be recognized, somewhat altered, 
                        in the couplet about &#x201c;<orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">avenel</orgName>s fate&#x201d;: for example, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TTACKET">Tibb</persName> observes that <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MARYAVENEL">Mary Avenel</persName>, having been born on Halloween, 
                        is able to &#x201c;&#x2018;see mair than ither folk&#x2019;&#x201d;; and the gruff &#x201c;pshaw&#x201d; is characteristic of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#ELSPETGLENDINNING">Elspet</persName>, 
                        although in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s couplet the expression is suspended without a clear agent&#x2014;ambiguously applicable either to the <orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">Avenel</orgName> family or to outsiders 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SCOTTMONASTERYFIELDING"><persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY"><hi rend="italic">The Monastery</hi></title>, ed. <persName corresp="#PFIELDING">Fielding</persName></ref>, 
                        55&#x2013;56 [vol. 1, chap. 4]; and see also 40 [vol. 1, chap. 2]).</p>
                    
                    <p>The documentary evidence for next step in the process is open to multiple interpretations of the sequence of composition. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have composed the next couplet, 
                        &#x201c;so it was in this odd time / for a spirit haunted <orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">avenel</orgName>s line&#x201d;, with or without having made the deletion shown by strikethrough of the preceding couplet, 
                        &#x201c;to see things that nobody saw / except themselves, and would say pshaw&#x201d;. The two couplets read coherently in sequence if no lines are deleted&#x2014;&#x201c;but 
                        it was great <orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">avenel</orgName>s fate / to see things that nobody saw / except themselves, and would say pshaw / 
                        so it was in this odd time / for a spirit haunted <orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">avenels</orgName> line&#x201d;. In fact, the flow is improved by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s insertion of &#x201c;and&#x201d; above the beginning of the line, 
                        &#x201c;so it was in this odd time&#x201d; (the conjunction appears also in the fair copy). But the second couplet also flows coherently, if awkwardly, 
                        from &#x201c;but it was great <orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">avenel</orgName>s fate&#x201d; with the intervening couplet omitted. Finally, a third possibility 
                        can be drawn from the deletion of the line, &#x201c;for a spirit haunted <orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">avenels</orgName> line&#x201d;, in the manuscript: it is possible that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> never intended that line 
                        to form a couplet with the preceding line &#x201c;and so it was in this odd time&#x201d;; rather, the latter can be interpreted as a subtitution above the line, 
                        replacing &#x201c;for a spirit haunted <orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">avenels</orgName> line&#x201d;. (While the interlinear spacing in the manuscript does not appear crowded, 
                        the line &#x201c;so it was in this odd time&#x201d; does appear compacted relative to the cursive hand in the other lines.)</p>
                    
                    <p>In the simplest reconstruction of the process, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> can be imagined as composing the two couplets following &#x201c;but it was great <orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">avenel</orgName>s fate&#x201d; 
                        without making any deletions. Then he deleted the first, second, and fourth lines of the two couplets, leaving just &#x201c;and so it was this odd time&#x201d;. 
                        As part of this change, he inserted an asterisk to serve as a metamark following &#x201c;but it was great <orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">avenel</orgName>s fate&#x201d;. 
                        The metamark directs the reader to a line near the bottom of the page, &#x201c;to have a spirit in their line&#x201d;, which is marked by corresponding asterisk, 
                        and set off by a horizontal rule. The metamark signals that this line is to be inserted following &#x201c;but it was great <orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">avenel</orgName>s fate&#x201d;, 
                        thus substituting for the three deleted lines, and forming a completed couplet with the remaining line, &#x201c;to have a spirit in their line&#x201d;. 
                        The resulting revised passage reads, as in the fair copy, &#x201c;but it was great <orgName type="fictional" corresp="#AVENEL">avenel</orgName>s fate / 
                        to have a spirit in their line / and so it was this odd time&#x201d;. This outcome involving the insertion of the substitute line, as directed by the metamark, 
                        unquestionably formed the final action of the change, regardless of the process of deletion and substitution that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> followed with respect to the preceding pair of couplets.</p></note>
