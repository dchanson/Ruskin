                    while on their way to the seaside (not when arrived), <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> challenges <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> to guess &#x201c;&#x2018;what length . . . the silk&#x2010;worm can spin without breaking&#x2019;&#x201d;. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName>, thinking to provoke <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> with an exaggerated answer,

                    This information arises from a discussion of spiders (prompted by sighting their webs glistening with dew, as they travel)&#x2014;in particular, 
                    the &#x201c;&#x2018;silk spider, who spins silk, which is almost as fine, some say finer, than that of the silk&#x2010;worm&#x2019;&#x201d;.</p>
                    
                    <p>All this is prelude to &#x201c;&#x2018;<hi rend="italic">the grand thing</hi>&#x2019;&#x201d; that <persName type="ficitonal" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> looks forward to seeing 
                        in <placeName corresp="#LANCASHIRE">Lancashire</placeName>&#x2014;a working steam engine in a cotton mill. After examining the machinery, they learn that the produce, a skein of cotton yarn, 
                    &#x201c;&#x2018;if stretched out, would make a thread one hundred and sixty&#x2010;seven miles in length&#x2019;&#x201d;. This achievement, the children decide, puts their spiders and silkworms in the shade, 
                    but their father remarks &#x201c;that the proper object of comparison between rival spinners is, not the length of the thread, but the fineness. &#x2018;And I apprehend&#x2019;, said he, 
                    &#x2018;that either a silk&#x2010;worm or spiders&#x02bc; thread, is as fine as one fibre of cotton wool; and the finest thread of cotton <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be composed of many fibres&#x2019; 
                    So that, notwithstanding <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName>&#x02bc;s exultation in the superiority of men and women spinners over worms and spiders, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> was compelled to give judgment in favour of the animals&#x201d;

                        When the time comes to recite his lesson, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> is disgraced, because he has procrastinated, 
                        distracted by play outdoors and by the more entertaining reading that occupies his sister, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MARYME">Mary</persName>. 
                        Amid these distractions, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> has studied only fitfully, trying &#x201c;the patience of a mother&#x201d; who has more time to hear his imperfectly memorized lesson. 
                        When even his <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MAMMAMEFS">mother</persName> limits the number of recitals she will entertain, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> turns to his compliant sister. 
                        Although untrained in Latin, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MARYME">Mary</persName> reads well enough to warn him to be more exact (1:58, 75).</p>
                    
                    <p>Unlike the successful manipulation of auditors by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName>, which leaves her parents with no option but bemused compliance, 
                        <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02bc;s episode poses a test of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName>&#x02bc;s resolve to memorize his lesson efficiently and on time, 
                        that he may &#x201c;early learn habits of attention and application&#x201d; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>, <title type="lesson" corresp="#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><hi rend="italic">Frank: A Sequel</hi></title></ref>, 1:89). 
                        His failure leads the adults to confer among themselves, as do the parents in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s version, 
                        but the discussion between <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02bc;s adults is solemn, reflecting the book&#x02bc;s thesis, which is set forth in the author&#x02bc;s preface: 
                        parents should instill habits of self&#x2010;control in their sons before sending them to public school. 
                        If parents neglect to train their sons in self&#x2010;command, the boys will succumb to their schoolfellows&#x02bc; reckless challenges to prove their &#x201c;manliness&#x201d; 
                        in foolish and damaging ways. The argument is not that proper manliness is to be instilled by corporal punishment: 
                        <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName>&#x02bc;s response to his disgrace ultimately disproves <persName type="fictional" corresp="#COLONELBIRCHME">Colonel Birch</persName>&#x02bc;s contention that a boy will learn his Latin 
                        only if its rules are &#x201c;flogged&#x201d; into him by schoolmasters. Rather, as <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> demonstrates, self&#x2010;control must be mastered by the boy himself. 
                        Recovering from his sobs, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> retires to gain control over himself and his get his lesson by heart. Then, in the scene that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> adapts to his own purposes, 
                        <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> &#x201c;march[es] up&#x201d; to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#COLONELBIRCHME">Colonel Birch</persName> to say his lesson perfectly (just as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> &#x201c;marched up&#x201d; to her <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PAPA">father</persName> 
                        to command his time, but without disgracing herself like <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName>). In <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02bc;s tale, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> proves over the following weeks that he can be relied on, 
                        and his <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PAPAMEFS">father</persName> rescinds his decision to send <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> to school earlier than originally planned 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>, <title type="lesson" corresp="#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><hi rend="italic">Frank: A Sequel</hi></title></ref>, 1:86&#x2013;96).</p>
                    
                    <p>According to <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="lesson" corresp="#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><hi rend="italic">Frank: A Sequel</hi></title>, the cultural cause of parental laxness in instilling boys&#x02bc; self&#x2010;discipline is not neglect of education, 
                        but a parents&#x02bc; preoccupation with and excessive intervention in learning. The &#x201c;fault of the present day&#x201d;, according to the author&#x02bc;s preface, 
                        is the phenomenon of &#x201c;anxious private education&#x201d;. While the danger to a home&#x2010;schooled boy is effeminacy, the undermining of manliness 
                        is caused only in part by living too much at home &#x201c;&#x2018;with gentle girls and women&#x2019;&#x201d;. In contemporary home education, both fathers and mothers 
                        can be at fault for &#x201c;too much anxiety concerning details. Parents and private tutors are not only too eager to adopt every new receipt 
                        for teaching much in a short time, but are also too easily alarmed by every deficiency which they perceive in their pupils, 
                        and draw too readily evil auguries from every trifle. They are so anxious to make their pupils go on, and go right, 
                        and go straight, every instant, that they deprive them of the power of acting, thinking, feeling for themselves. 
                        Thus they turn them either into helpless puppets, who must cease to move, or fall when the guiding strings are no longer pulled; 
                        or, if they be not reduced to this automaton state, they become restive, wilful creatures, who, the instant they are at liberty, 
                        set off in a contrary direction to that in which they have been forced&#x201d; (1:54, xvi&#x2013;xvii).</p>
                    
                    <p>To reward <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> for disciplining himself in his lessons, his <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PAPAMEFS">father</persName> allows him &#x201c;what I know will be agreeable&#x201d;, teaching him to ride&#x2014;and 
                        not &#x201c;the old pony; or, as <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> would call it, the <hi rend="italic">tame</hi> pony&#x201d;, but a &#x201c;spirited&#x201d; horse. 
                        When his <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MAMMAMEFS">mother</persName> demurs, his <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PAPAMEFS">father</persName> explains: &#x201c;Boys, who have been carefully brought up at home, have often something effeminate or precise about them; 
                        perhaps they do not know how to leap, or to run, or to ride; for this they are laughed at by their school&#x2010;fellows, and they often get into mischief, 
                        merely to show that they are manly&#x201d; (1:97, 98, 100). The earliest reference in the family letters to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> riding his Shetland pony,

                        &#x201c;&#x2018;You see in a dark night the flash of a gun, but, 
                    being at a considerable distance from it, you hear no report. If, however, you knew that the light was occasioned 
                    by the inflammation of gunpowder in a musket or pistol, you would conclude that it was attended with sound, 
                    though it was not sufficiently strong to reach the place where you are.&#x2019;&#x201d; <persName type="fictional" corresp="#CHARLESJJ">Charles</persName> shows that he gets the point 
                    by recalling an actual experience of the same kind: &#x201c;&#x2018;As we were walking last summer towards <placeName corresp="#HAMPSTEAD">Hampstead</placeName>,

                    and you desired <persName type="fictional" corresp="#EMMAJJ">Emma</persName> and me to take notice as we approached the spot, how much sooner the report was heard after we saw the flash, 
                    than it was when we first got into the fields&#x2019;&#x201d;. His <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FATHERJJ">father</persName> ties together the past experience and the present conversation: 
                    &#x201c;&#x2018;My intention [at that time] was, that you should know, 
                    from actual experiment, that sound is not conveyed instantaneously, but takes a certain time to travel over a given space&#x201d;&#x2019;

                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s experiment encapsulates discussion of the speed of sound, but inaudible sounds in <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName> have more to do with showing that 
                    sound cannot travel in a vacuum: &#x201c;&#x2018;I remember&#x2019;&#x201d;, says <persName type="fictional" corresp="#CHARLESJJ">Charles</persName>, &#x201c;&#x2018;being once in a room at the distance of but a few paces from the Tower guns when they fired

                    His summary of the procedure for lifting and supporting a ship&#x02bc;s keel, besides being slightly inaccurate, 
                    is difficult to follow, because <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> omits <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName>&#x02bc;s contextualizing.</p>
                    
                    <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> begins with more obvious and traditional means of raising a ship in dry dock: 
                    &#x201c;&#x2018;Some time ago, the day my <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PAPAME">father</persName> took me into the dock&#x2010;yard, he showed me a ship lying in what is called a dock. 
                    The keel was to be repaired, and for this purpose it was necessary to raise up the ship, so that the workmen might get underneath. 
                    The question my <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PAPAME">father</persName> asked me was, &#x2018;how the vessel could be raised?&#x2019; I was an hour puzzling about it, . . . 
                    but never [thought] of the easy way that was before my eyes&#x2014;to let in the water from outside of the dock. The water,
                    you know, would gradually float the vessel, and raise it up to the proper height, where it could be propped up, and the water let out again next tide.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p>
                    
                    <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> inquires about a &#x201c;different way of raising a ship&#x201d; that she knows their <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PAPAME">father</persName> had described to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName>. 
                        <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> goes on: &#x201c;&#x2018;You must first of all know, that when a vessel is floated into a dock to be repaired, 
                        <hi rend="italic">she</hi> is allowed to settle down with her keel upon thick wooden blocks, along the middle of the dock: 
                        . . . formerly when she was to be raised up, for the people to get under the keel, two or three hundred <hi rend="italic">shores</hi>, 
                        or props of timber, were placed all under her bottom, nearly upright; wedges were then just pointed under the lower end of each of these shores, 
                        and all the workmen from every part of the dock&#x2010;yard being summoned with their <hi rend="italic">mauls</hi>, or huge hammers, 
                        and stationed one or two to each shore, the wedges were all struck at the same instant by word of command. 
                        A few blows from all the mauls was sufficient just to raise the ship from off the blocks, which were then taken away, 
                        and the ship was left hanging in the air, supported by the shores&#x2019;&#x201d;.</p>
                    
                    <p>The new way, which has replaced this time&#x2010; and labor&#x2010;intensive method, is what <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> summarizes: 
                        &#x201c;&#x2018;The blocks on which the keel is to lie are not solid lumps of wood; they are composed of three pieces, two of which are <hi rend="italic">wedges</hi>, 
                        and when these are knocked out, the centre piece of the block falls. The ship is floated into the dock as usual, 
                        and when the water subsides, the keel rests on the new&#x2010;fashioned blocks: the forest of shores are then firmly placed 
                        under all parts of the ship&#x02bc;s bottom, in the same way as I described to you before, but without any wedges [pointed beneath the shores]. 
                        Now, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName>, comes the beautiful contrivance&#x2014;two or three men only are sufficient to do the rest: 
                        they give a few knocks on the sides of the wedges, of which the blocks are composed&#x2014;out they fly&#x2014;the blocks sink, 
                        and the ship hangs on the shores&#x2019;&#x201d;.</p>
                    
                    <p><persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> agrees that &#x201c;&#x2018;it is such a pretty contrivance, that 1 should like very much to see it done.

                    they restore themselves to their former position&#x201d;. However, &#x201c;the reverse of the attraction of cohesion&#x201d; or &#x201c;repulsion&#x201d;

Specifically, the observation of mountains by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> could be a borrowing from <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>, 
                    not only because <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02bc;s characters travel to the West Country, but also because <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02bc;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName>, 
                    from the moment he hears the prospect of going to the seaside, longs &#x201c;&#x2018;to see mountains, and go up them with my portable barometer&#x2019;&#x201d; (1:186). 
                    This desire arises near the beginning of the book, when <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> proposes to measure the height of a mountain by comparing the difference between barometric pressures at sea level and at the top the mountain, 
                    and converting the difference in degrees to a scale in feet. Prior to their journey, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> and his <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PAPAME">father</persName> carry out the experiment on a more limited scale by scaling 
                    a church tower with the portable barometer in hand, thereby working out the tower&#x02bc;s height. <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName> uses this episode to prompt learning through several comparisons of a thematic kind, 
                    including tensions between <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName>&#x02bc;s bent for theorizing and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName>&#x02bc;s pragmatism, between <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName>&#x02bc;s solemn methodicalness and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName>&#x02bc;s mercurial imaginativeness, 
                    and between <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName>&#x02bc;s braving adventures to the point of imprudence and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName>&#x02bc;s voicing anxieties to the point of endangering others (see 1:19&#x2013;38).</p>
                    
                    <p>As

                    This portion of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s narrative was taken by <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> to be &#x201c;probably a bit of history&#x201d; 
                    solely on the grounds, it seeems, that the adventures are &#x201c;told with lively artlessness&#x201d;

                     But while <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> folds in at least one episode directly from <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName> (the exploding wagon), 
                    it does seem unlikely that he would wholly invent a journey taken in the opposite direction from <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02bc;s characters, 
                    unless his parents had actually taken him to <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName>&#x2014;a place that, compared to <placeName corresp="#BRISTOL">Bristol</placeName> and environs, 
                    had only recently begun promoting itself as a tourist destination. Tending to the confirm the basis in reality, 
                    the Ruskins are known to have visited <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName> on at least one other occasion, and probably more (see

                        owing not only to their picturesque beauty but also to their settlement with villas. On the London Road beyond the spa,

                        The wagoner &#x201c;had no clear idea of the danger he had run, till <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName>&#x02bc;s father told him, that he had some years before known a waggon 
                    to have been blown to pieces, and men and horses killed, by just such an accident. Some gunpowder had been shaken out of a barrel 
                    in the waggon, and had taken fire, as it is supposed, from a spark struck from a flint in the road. This communicating with the gunpowder 
                    had blown up the whole&#x201d;. The wagoner is a &#x201c;sulky fellow&#x201d; and disbelieves the story until hearing the name of the hill where the accident occurred. 
                    The narrator observes: &#x201c;So it is, that ignorant people believe or disbelieve, without any reasonable grounds&#x201d;. The wagon&#x02bc;s passengers, 
                    overhearing the explanation, express their gratitude, and the wagoner moderates his demeanor. Speaking in a country dialect, 
                    which <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName> imitates, he thanks <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> for doing them &#x201c;&#x2018;a mortal good turn&#x2019;&#x201d; and offers him a service in return,

                    While the writing abruptly becomes noticeably more derivative, which may suggest that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was merely filling the remaining space

                    In the fourth and final volume of <title type="lesson" corresp="#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><hi rend="italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</hi></title>, <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02bc;s book is likewise treated as a close companion.</p>
                    
                    <p>Toward the end of volume 3 and start of volume 4, <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02bc;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> settle into the scientific workshop at Digby Castle, the residence 
                    of the landlord of their seaside cottage, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#RUPERTDIGBYME">Sir Rupert Digby</persName>. In volume 3, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#RUPERTDIGBYME">Sir Rupert</persName> invites the family for a long stay at the castle. 
                    The setting combines medievalism with scientific modernism, providing an extensively equipped workshop that &#x201c;would be enough for <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName>&#x201d;, 
                    while supplying &#x201c;an old garden and old hermitage for <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName>, to say nothing of a new conservatory, and a library for all, with books that were not locked up&#x201d;. 
                    Admitted to this fantasy educational playground, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> is admonished at the end of volume 3 that she &#x201c;may learn what you desire, but not all at once&#x201d;&#x2014;cautioned, 
                    as so often in the book, against seeking more knowledge than &#x201c;what you . . . [can keep] steadily in your mind&#x201d;, 
                    and she is supported by &#x201c;<persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName>&#x02bc;s help&#x201d;, who is himself &#x201c;&#x2018;assisted by his favourite book, &#x2018;Scientific Dialogues&#x2019;&#x201d;. 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> seems to step into an analogous role, moving as it were from beach to workshop.

                    <p>In <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02bc;s volume 1, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> expresses skepticism about the utility of the air pump 
                    as compared with the water pump, which has an obvious practical application. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> defends the scientific instrument 
                    for its role in &#x201c;&#x2018;many experiments in natural history . . . that could never have been tried, and discoveries that could never have been made 
                    without it&#x2019;&#x201d;. As an example, he cites the demonstration &#x201c;&#x2018;that a guinea and a feather would fall to the ground in the same time, 
                    if there was no air to resist the fall of either of them&#x2019;&#x201d;. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> is incredulous, though she has read about the phenomenon, 
                    and remembers also that the guinea supposedly makes no noise when it falls. She wants <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> to show her the experiment, 
                    and explain why the guinea makes no noise, but <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> admits he neither understands the cause of the alleged noiselessness 
                    nor has he been able to replicate the effect with the instrument available to him. In his trials, &#x201c;&#x2018;[t]he guinea fell on the metal plate here at the bottom [of the air pump], 
                    and this plate touches the outer air, and rings, makes a noise&#x2019;&#x201d;. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> promises, however, that <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> &#x201c;&#x2018;shall see all this, and a great deal more in time&#x2019;&#x201d;.</p>
                    
                    <p>This particular experiment is never taken up again in the book; instead, the point of mentioning the experiment appears to be to reinforce 
                        patience and method, and to caution against attempting to learn more than one can rationally absorb at a given time. In this instance, 
                        &#x201c;<persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> said she was satisfied to wait; that it was best not to know everything at once, and pleasant to have something to look forward to&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>, <title type="lesson" corresp="#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><hi rend="italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</hi></title></ref>, 1:134&#x2013;36). Thus, since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> writes out the mechanism of the experiment that <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02bc;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYME">Harry</persName> does not explain, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> might be said to oblige the anticipation that <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCYME">Lucy</persName> expresses in <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>. As <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> says, he was &#x201c;[r]emembering that <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> wanted to see&#x201d; the experiment.</p>
                    
                    <p>For the details of the experiment, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> draws on <title type="lesson" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUESAIRPUMP">Conversation 2, &#x201C;Of the Air&#x2010;Pump&#x201D;</title>, 
                        in <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02bc;s volume on pneumatics. The explanation is keyed to diagrams at the end of the volume:</p>

                                <p><hi rend="italic">Tutor</hi>. The wind is, undoubtedly, one of the causes, but it will not account for every appearance connected with them. 
                                    Water&#x2010;spouts are often seen in calm weather, when the sea seems to boil, and send up a smoke under them, rising in a sort of hill towards the spout. 
                                    A rumbling noise is often heard at the time of their appearance, which happens generally in those months that are peculiarly subject to thunder&#x2010;storms, 
                                    and they are commonly accompanied or followed by lightning. When these approach a ship, the sailors present and brandish their swords to disperse them, 
                                    which seems to favour the conclusion, that they are electrical. . . .</p>
                                <p>Water&#x2010;spouts, at sea, are undoubtedly very like whirlwinds and hurricanes by land. These sometimes tear up trees, 
                                    throw down buildings, make caverns; and, in all the cases, they scatter the earth, bricks, stones, timber, &#x0026;c., 
                                    to a great distance in every direction. <persName corresp="#BF">Dr. Franklin</persName> mentions a remarkable appearance 
                                    which occurred to <persName corresp="#JWILCKE">Mr. Wilke</persName>, a considerable electrician. On the <date when="1758-07-20">20th of July, 1758</date>, 
                                    at three o&#x02bc;clock in the afternoon, he observed a great quantity of dust rising from the ground, and covering a field, 
                                    and part of the town in which he then was. There was no wind, and the dust moved gently towards the east, 
                                    where there appeared a great black cloud, which electrified his apparatus positively to a very high degree. 
                                    This cloud went towards the west, the dust followed it, and continued to rise higher and higher, 
                                    till it composed a thick pillar in the form of a sugar loaf, and at length it seemed to be in contact 
                                    with the cloud. At some distance from this there came another great cloud, with a long stream of smaller ones, 
                                    which electrified his apparatus negatively, and when they came near the positive cloud, a flash of
                                    lightning was seen to dart through the cloud of dust, upon which the negative clouds spread very much, and dissolved in rain, 
                                    which presently cleared the atmosphere.</p>

                        he cribbed nearly verbatim from a section entitled &#x201c;The Attempts that have been made to explain some of the more unusual appearances in the earth and heaven by electricity&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PRIESTLEYHISTORYOFELECTRICITY"><persName corresp="#JP">Priestley</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#PRIESTLEYHISTORYOFELECTRICITY"><hi rend="italic">History and Present State of Electricity</hi></title></ref>, 1:433&#x2013;61 [vol. 1, sect. 12]). 
                        In that section, <persName corresp="#JP">Priestley</persName> collects hypotheses about electrical causes of natural phenomena, especially observations by the Italian physicist <persName corresp="#GBECCARIA">Giambattista Beccaria</persName> (<date notBefore="1716" notAfter="1781">1716&#x2013;81</date>). 
                        <persName corresp="#GBECCARIA">Beccaria</persName> made his reputation as one of <geogName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</geogName>&#x02bc;s most fervent champions of <persName corresp="#BF">Franklin</persName>&#x02bc;s theories, positioning himself in opposition to the rival French school of electricians 
                        headed by <persName corresp="#ANOLLET">Abb&#x00E9; Nollet</persName> (<date notBefore="1700" notAfter="1770">1700&#x2013;1770</date>). As one core difference, the French school had come to account for the phenomenon of electrical attraction and repulsion by theorizing two differing kinds 
                        of electrical &#x201c;fluid&#x201d;, whereas <persName corresp="#BF">Franklin</persName> proposed a single fluid capable of two differing states&#x2014;positive and negative, or plus and minus, 
                        which <persName corresp="#BF">Franklin</persName> conceived as an excess or a deficiency of charge associated with a body, as compared with its neutral state. In this mathematical approach to theorizing the phenomenon, 
                        as opposed to <persName corresp="#ANOLLET">Nollet</persName>&#x02bc;s fixation on kind, <persName corresp="#BF">Franklin</persName> understood a body&#x02bc;s fluctuating states of charge in terms of influences acting on it, affecting what he called the body&#x02bc;s surrounding &#x201c;atmosphere&#x201d; of charge

Amid these competing theories, 
                        <persName corresp="#JP">Priestley</persName> wrote his account of the &#x201c;present state&#x201d; of electrical theory, already committed to support of <persName corresp="#BF">Franklin</persName> (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SCHIFFERDRAWTHELIGHTNINGDOWN"><persName corresp="#MBS">Schiffer</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#SCHIFFERDRAWTHELIGHTNINGDOWN"><hi rend="italic">Draw the Lightning Down</hi></title></ref>, 72&#x2013;73). 
                        Thus, in the section on electricity as an underlying cause of dramatic natural phenomena on earth and in the heavens, 
                        a commonality linking the observations that <persName corresp="#JP">Priestley</persName> draws from <persName corresp="#GBECCARIA">Beccaria</persName> and others lies in the support their observations lend to <persName corresp="#BF">Franklin</persName>&#x02bc;s theories.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#JP">Priestley</persName>&#x02bc;s chapter is not merely partisan, however. As <persName corresp="#MBS">Michael Brian Schiffer</persName> remarks, 
                        although <date notBefore="1701" notAfter="1800">eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> electricians exaggerated the role that electricity plays in causation of a multitude of natural phenomena, 
                        the ability to model massive natural forces in laboratory experiments and pose theoretical explanations confirmed the power and prestige of <date notBefore="1637" notAfter="1815">Enlightenment</date> ideology

                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> seems to have been drawn to <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02bc;s conversation summarizing these atmospheric and terrestrial effects&#x2014;the only chapter

                        but also because he can join the explanatory power of science to the image&#x2010;making power of poetry, finding &#x201c;something like&#x201d; the experimentally observed interaction of positively and negatively charged rainclouds in <persName corresp="#GCB">Byron</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="poem" corresp="#BYRONMANFRED"><hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi></title>.

                    <p>One can probably claim too much for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s understanding in this culminating extract from <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="book" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></title>.

                        occurs among Franklinian explanations of &#x201c;unusual&#x201d; manifestations of electricity in nature&#x2014;a chapter that follows a more systematic treatment of the progress of electrical theory. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> exhibits no command of that sustained investigation; rather, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName>&#x2010;like, he dips into a miscellany, which is reflected in <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02bc;s title enumerating the &#x201c;unusual appearances&#x201d; in <persName corresp="#JP">Priestley</persName>&#x02bc;s

                        a phenomenon made possible when the upper atmosphere becomes heated. Just so, <persName corresp="#JP">Priestley</persName> confirms, recent experiments with the mineral <name type="geological" corresp="#TOURMALINE">tourmaline</name> 
                        reveal that it &#x201c;will, without friction, both emit and absorb the electric fluid, only by the increase or diminution of its heat&#x201d;

                        Investigations of the electrical properties of <name type="geological" corresp="#TOURMALINE">tourmaline</name> were conducted by the German physicist

                        by heating the mineral, a positive charge collects on one face of the crystal and a negative charge on the opposite face. This discovery, a historian explains, 
                        was interpreted as strongly favoring &#x201c;the Franklinian doctrine that there were two contrary modes of electrification possible in nature&#x2014;called

                        In <persName corresp="#JP">Priestley</persName>&#x02bc;s chapter, the origin of these observations is cited as <persName corresp="#JWILCKE">Wilcke</persName>&#x02bc;s translation of <persName corresp="#BF">Franklin</persName>&#x02bc;s letters on electricity,

                        Their appraisal on balance awarded qualified support to <persName corresp="#BF">Franklin</persName>&#x02bc;s ideas (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HEILBRONELECTRICITY"><persName corresp="#JLH">Heilbron</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HEILBRONELECTRICITY"><hi rend="italic">Electricity in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries</hi></title></ref>, 384&#x2013;90).
