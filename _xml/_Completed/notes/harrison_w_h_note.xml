                    As their home residence, the Harrisons lived nearby the Ruskins in the suburb of <placeName corresp="#CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</placeName>, 
                    but <persName corresp="#THILTON">Hilton</persName> believes that, though <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> often dined at <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName> and later <placeName corresp="DENMARKHL">Denmark Hill</placeName>, &#x201c;the Ruskins did not call at his small, poor home&#x201d; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HILTONRUSKINLATERYEARS"><title type="book" corresp="#HILTONRUSKINLATERYEARS"><hi rend="italic">John Ruskin: The Later Years</hi></title></ref>, 217). <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> typically addressed <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> at his <orgName corresp="#CROWNLIFE">Crown Life</orgName> office to discuss editorial business.</p>
                <p>When the Ruskins first became acquainted with <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> (presumably when he took over editorship of 
                    <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>), he would have been able to regale them 
                    with reports of conversation with such relics of Regency literary society as <persName corresp="#WTB">William Beckford</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1760" notAfter="1844">1760&#x2013;1844</date>) 
                    as well as with influential literary men of the day, such as the editor <persName corresp="#WJ">William Jerdan</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1782" notAfter="1869">1782&#x2013;1869</date>) 
                    and the author and clergyman <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="croly_george_note.php"><persName corresp="#GCREV">George Croly</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1780" notAfter="1860">1780&#x2013;1860</date>)</ref>. 
                    <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>&#x02BC;s piquant recollections of famous writers&#x02BC; appearance, haunts, and conversation suggest a man of humor and observation, 
                    and a frequenter of convivial and benevolent institutions such as the <orgName corresp="#LITERARYFUND">Literary Fund Club</orgName>. <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> then was a respectable 
                    City man with minor literary and artistic connections, who for that reason would have appealed to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, 
                    and who shared <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s ultra&#x2010;Tory opinions about the supremacy of the British church and state as a bulwark against <orgName corresp="#ROMANCATHOLICCHURCH">Roman Catholicism</orgName>. 
                    <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> was also, one suspects, obsequious to the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskins</persName>&#x02bc; pretensions and did not object to taking a gentlemanly form of remuneration for his services.</p>
                <p>According to his memoir, <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> traced his first encounter with a famous
                    author to hearing <persName corresp="#STC">S. T. Coleridge</persName> (ca.<date notBefore="1772" notAfter="1834">1772&#x2013;1834</date>), in lectures that can

                    &#x201C;He was giving a series of lectures on the belles lettres in a large room on the first floor of a sixth&#x2010;rate tavern at
                    the end of a blind alley on the right hand side of <placeName type="building" corresp="#FETTERLANE">Fetter Lane</placeName>, not far from
                    <placeName type="building" corresp="#FLEETST">Fleet Street</placeName>. . . . I heard <persName corresp="#STC">Coleridge</persName> lecture the same winter at the <orgName corresp="#SURREYINSTITUTION">Surrey Institution</orgName>,

                <p><persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> was also personally acquainted with artists, connections that long pre&#x2010;existed 
                    his association with the Ruskins. He claimed that his friendship with the genre painter <persName corresp="#WE">William Etty</persName>
                    (ca. <date notBefore="1787" notAfter="1849">1787&#x2013;1849</date>) reached back to their teens:

                    which shifted perceptions from British &#x201C;Enlightenment dismissals of <placeName corresp="#SPAIN">Spain</placeName> as the antithesis of all rationalist ideas and practices 
                    to an enthusiastic &#x2018;hispanophilia&#x2019;&#x201D;. The letterpress for these volumes was written by <persName corresp="#TRT">Thomas Roscoe</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1791" notAfter="1871">1791&#x2013;1871</date>),

                    <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> provided letterpress for the follow&#x2010;up annual for <date when="1839">1839</date>, featuring scenes in <placeName corresp="#PORTUGAL">Portugal</placeName>,

                    It is not clear whether <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> visited <placeName corresp="#IBERIA">Iberia</placeName> for the purpose. In the preface,

                    The annual&#x02BC;s narrative is stiffly patched together from historical sources and a travel record of mundane encounters with fleas, dirt, and stubborn servants

                    the father of his precocious contributor, <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">J.R.</persName>, and the traveling partner of a firm that imported Portuguese sherry.</p>
                <p>Subsequently, <placeName corresp="#PORTUGAL">Portugal</placeName> became something of a specialty of <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>&#x02BC;s,
                    supplying the setting for other tales and poems in the annuals, such as <!--Entry needed here.-->.
                    <!--<persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> is self&#x2010;consciously a writer of &#x201C;light
                    literature&#x201D;, however, and, for him,
                    a &#x201C;specialty&#x201D; necessarily reflected a cultural
                    phenomenon&#x2014;in this case, the appeal of the <placeName corresp="#IBERIA">Iberian peninsula</placeName> to the
                    late Romantic and early Victorian imagination, owing to <placeName corresp="#SPAIN">Spain</placeName>&#x02BC;s
                    occupation and looting by <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName> and subsequent liberation, along with
                    subsequent visits by <persName corresp="#DRP">Roberts</persName> and <persName corresp="#DWC">David Wilkie</persName> figuring in prominence of.

                    fashion of many writers for the ephemeral travel literature of the day, culling
                    and synthesizing information available in the vast outpouring of volumes
                    published by travelers to exotic places. This approach is significant as it
                    provides some basis for speculating about the manner of conversation between
                    <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> and <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, who did possibly travel to <placeName corresp="#PORTUGAL">Portugal</placeName> prior to his
                    marriage, and who was a partner with the Portuguese vintner <persName corresp="#PD">Pedro Domecq</persName>.--></p>
                <p>The reticence of <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="essay" corresp="#HARRISONREMINISCENCES">&#x201C;Notes and Reminiscences&#x201D;</title>, 
                    in which he mentions the Ruskins only in passing, perhaps played a part in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s crafting 
                    of the much more delicately balanced rhetoric&#x2014;poised between nostalgic admiration and critical satire&#x2014;in his introduction to these sketches, 
                    <title type="essay" corresp="#JRMYFIRSTEDITOR">&#x201C;My First Editor: An Autobiographical Reminiscence&#x201D;</title>. 
                    <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>, for his part, appears to have deemed reflection on his friendship and professional relation with the Ruskins 
                    to have been out of bounds for his memoir, with the possible exception of the section on <placeName corresp="#OXFORD">Oxford</placeName>. 
                    That portion reads like an unused travel sketch for the annuals, recounted by the narrator of his tales and sketches&#x2014;genial, ironic, given to rhetorical flourish. 
                    The sketch concludes by opening a window only slightly on the relationship he developed with the 
                    &#x201C;Graduate of <orgName corresp="#OXFORDU">Oxford</orgName>&#x201D;: &#x201C;As in athletics, so in intellectual contests, life is often the price of the prize. 
                    Here is a poem from the pen of an undergraduate, who has since achieved a world&#x2010;wide fame. 
                    It was published without the name of the author, and I dare not add it&#x201D;&#x2014;and he quotes <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s

                    The mixture of anxiety and nostalgia speaks worlds without giving much away.
