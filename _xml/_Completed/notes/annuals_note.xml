                    <head type="section">Annuals</head>
                    <p>Literary annuals were anthologies of verse, short fiction and essays, along with engraved images, which were marketed to serve as gifts and tokens of friendship. 
                        In <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>, the annuals first emerged 
                     in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, based primarily on a German model of the form, but also incorporating features of native precursors 
                        such as the almanac, album, and the <date notBefore="1700" notAfter="1799">eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> &#x201C;pocket book&#x201D; used for notes and engagements.
                    Supported by innovations in mass reproduction of images and cheapened production of specialty bindings, the annuals contributed significantly to the visual culture 
                    of <date notBefore="1837-06-20" notAfter="1860-01-22">early Victorian</date> <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>.</p>
                
                    <p>Most annuals presented text and image to some extent ekphrastically, typically using a Romantic&#x2010;era aesthetic 
                    of a shared &#x201C;poetic&#x201D; emotion uniting the Sister Arts 
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php#POETRYOFSISTERARTS"><title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering:</hi> </title>: The Poetry of the Sister Arts</ref>). 
                    Ekphrastic projects originated with the volume editor, who commissioned writers 
                    to respond to an engraving, rather than engaging artists to illustrate existing tales or verse, just as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> composed his poem 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="saltzburg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title></ref> in response to an engraved view 
                        of the city that the editor, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="pringle_thomas_note.php"><persName corresp="#TP">Thomas Pringle</persName></ref> (<date notBefore="1789" notAfter="1835">1789&#x2013;1834</date>), already had in hand. By the time <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> began publishing his poetry in the annuals 
                        in the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>, they were a widely popular component of middle&#x2010;class visual and print culture, in which the Ruskin family already participated as consumers.</p>
                
                <p>As tokens of endearment to be exchanged between lovers, friends, or family members, annuals were published toward the end of a given year, in late October or November, 
                    in time for the holiday season of Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s. Their titles therefore named the year following that of their actual publication. 
                    For example, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s first appearance in an annual was in the volume &#x201C;for&#x201D; <date when="1835">1835</date>, entitled 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath: A Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present for MDCCCXXXV</hi></title></ref>, 
                    but copy was sent to the printer as early as <date when="1834-08">August 1834</date> (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#VIGNEPRINGLE"><persName corresp="#RV">Vigne</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#VIGNEPRINGLE"><hi rend="italic">Thomas Pringle</hi></title></ref>, 244), 
                    in order to be available for purchase no later than <date notBefore="1834-11" notAfter="1834-12">November or December</date>.</p>
                
                    <p>Because the Ruskins were Scots, they celebrated New Year&#x02BC;s rather than Christmas, 
                        and the family tradition included <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s presentation of a <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="new_years_poems_note.php">New Year&#x02BC;s poem</ref> addressed to his father 
                    from almost the earliest time when he could manage a pencil. 
                    There appears no foundation for regarding this family tradition as influenced by the annuals: <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s holiday poems long preceded his publications in the annuals, as a feature of the earliest juvenilia, 
                        and he continued composing personalized New Year&#x02BC;s odes for the family independently of the poems published with the signature <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">&#x201C;J.R.&#x201D;</persName> for public consumption. One can imagine, however, that the family cheer occasioned by <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s annual recitation of a New Year&#x02BC;s ode at the dinner table 
                        was augmented by pride in his contribution to the <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1830">&#x201C;Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present&#x201D;</title> of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>, which was being exchanged in that season among thousands.</p>

                    <p>The first British annual was <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title>, published by the firm of <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> with the date <date when="1823">1823</date> for the holiday season of <date notBefore="1822-11" notAfter="1823-02">1822&#x2013;23</date>. 
                        As a publisher, <persName corresp="#RAP">Rudolf Ackermann</persName> (<date notBefore="1764" notAfter="1834">1764&#x2013;1834</date>) was known primarily for his high quality, extravagant topographical books, 
                        illustrated by brightly colored aquatints. For the <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title>, <persName corresp="#RAP">Ackermann</persName> hit upon a successful blend 
                        of polite and sentimental verse, tales, and engraved illustration aimed at middle&#x2010; and upper&#x2010;class consumers, especially women, 
                        who already formed the primary audience for the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm&#x02BC;s in&#x2010;house magazine, 
                        the <title type="periodical" corresp="#REPOSITORYOFARTS"><hi rend="italic">Repository of Arts</hi></title> (<date notBefore="1809" notAfter="1828">1809&#x2013;28</date>). 
                        The magazine&#x02BC;s editor, <persName corresp="#FS">Frederic Shoberl</persName> (<date notBefore="1775" notAfter="1853">1775&#x2013;1853</date>), did double duty as the editor of the <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN"><persName corresp="#JFORD">Ford</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#FORDACKERMANN"><hi rend="italic">Ackermann</hi></title></ref>, 70, 64&#x2013;65, 80&#x2013;83).</p>
                        
                        <div type="sub-subsection" xml:id="PRCURSORS">
                            <head type="sub-subsection">Precursors of the Annuals</head>
                    <p>According to <persName corresp="#AR">Anne Renier</persName>, <persName corresp="#RAP">Ackermann</persName> based his creation on a combination of two models, the German <hi rend="italic">Taschenbuch</hi>, and the British <hi rend="italic">pocket book</hi>. 
                        The former kind of publication modeled the literary content and illustration for which the British annuals became known, 
                        whereas the latter presented tables of useful information along with blank or illustrated pages for the owner&#x02BC;s memoranda 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RENIERFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><persName corresp="#AR">Renier</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#RENIERFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title></ref>, 5&#x2013;6). 
                        To this ancestry of the annual, <persName corresp="#KDH">Katherine Harris</persName> adds the printed traditions of the emblem book and the almanac, 
                        as well as the homemade fashions of the lady&#x02BC;s album and the scrapbook, which were compiled by hand for personal collecting, 
                        although consumers could obtain a pre&#x2010;manufactured cover with blank pages 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISBORROWING"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HARRISBORROWING">&#x201C;Borrowing, Altering, and Perfecting the Literary Annual Form&#x201D;</title></ref>).
                        (Some confusion of terms arises from the similarity between the German <hi rend="italic">Taschenbuch</hi> 
                        and the English <hi rend="italic">pocket book</hi>, both terms referring to the publications&#x02BC; portable size, 
                        but the German form was literary, whereas the English <date notBefore="1700" notAfter="1799">eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> pocket book was akin to the almanac and diary.)
                    </p>
                    <p><date notBefore="1700" notAfter="1799">Eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> pocket books resembled almanacs by including reference information, especially tables of facts that were deemed appropriate 
                        to fashionable readers, such as lists of the members of the British royalty, the crowned heads of <geogName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</geogName>, and names of other dignitaries. 
                        This convention appealed to <persName corresp="#RAP">Ackermann</persName>, since he marketed his books and art supplies primarily to leisured and wealthy clientele, 
                        and accordingly the first <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> included a <title type="catalogue" corresp="#HOUSESOFBRITAINFORGETMENOT1823">&#x201C;General Summary of Houses, Families, and Persons in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Great Britain</placeName>, in <date when="1821">1821</date>&#x201D;</title>, along with tables of other demographic 
                        information about <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#WALES">Wales</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>. 
                        This first British annual also reflected the original use of the pocket book as an engagement calendar,   
                        being ornamented with a series of emblematic treatments of the twelve months, reproduced from copper engravings

                    </p>
                    <p>After the first <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title>, the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm dropped the almanac features; and according to <persName corresp="#KDH">Katherine Harris</persName>, by <date when="1825">1825</date> 
                        all British annuals had abandoned almanac&#x2010; and diary&#x2010;like elements in favor of strictly literary and pictorial contents 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISBORROWING"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HARRISBORROWING">&#x201C;Borrowing, Altering, and Perfecting the Literary Annual Form&#x201D;</title></ref>, 7). 
                        Along the way to this stabilization of annuals in shared elements of early Victorian ekphrastic print culture, what might now be viewed as transitional publications eshibited devices of engaging a Romantic&#x2010;era reader. 
                        As <persName corresp="#SLODGE">Sara Lodge</persName> has shown, pocket books published shortly prior 
                        to <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> 
                        combined features of the diary and almanac with the literary and artistic anthology, with the aim 
                        of inviting reader response. In the words of <persName corresp="#JHLH">Leigh Hunt</persName> prefacing the 
                        <title type="annual" corresp="HUNTSLITERARYPOCKETBOOK"><hi rend="italic">Literary Pocket&#x2010;Book; or, Companion for the Lover of Nature and Art</hi></title> 
                        (<date notBefore="1818" notAfter="1822">1818&#x2013;22</date>), 
                        the reader was encouraged to mark each passing day with a &#x201C;little homage . . . to a favourite writer or artist&#x201d; and to &#x201C;discuss the influence he has had upon taste and opinion&#x201d;. 
                        The result would be the owner&#x02BC;s own &#x201C;Calendar of Nature&#x201D; in place of a calendar of royalty

                            <p>As the literary annuals abandoned the features of the pocket book that invited readers to leave material traces of their creative engagement,

                                The annuals took over the publication schedule of pocket books, requiring release on the market in late October or November 
                                in time for purchase as Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s presents. Also like pocket books and almanacs, 
                                annuals lost perceived value as gifts after the beginning of the New Year; however, unlike their precursors, annuals were meant to be kept as permanent remembrances. 
                                They were elegant, but, at a base selling point of twelve shillings, affordable keepsakes, putting aside more costly annuals produced for the high&#x2010;end market

                        For example, in an early volume of the annual, <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>, the editor, <persName corresp="#TKH">T. K. Hervey</persName>,

                    <p>In order to make a profit based on a twelve&#x2010;shilling&#x2010;per&#x2010;copy bookseller price, publishers needed to produce and move copies in the thousands each season. 
                        An important printing development, which made high volume possible without degrading quality of image reproduction, 
                        was the practical introduction of intaglio printing from a steel plate. Because steel is much harder than copper&#x2014;the material that had been more commonly used in engraving and etching&#x2014;its 
                        durability increased the viability of print runs to the thousands of impressions, compared to the few hundreds of impressions possible from a copper plate. 
                        The advantage of copper is its pliable surface, which is easily engravd, but copper plates wore thin from the abrasion of wiping excess ink in successive impressions. 
                        Steel could stand up much longer to this routine procedure on the press, but innovations were required to make steel practicable for engraving, 
                        such as manufacturing a softer metal for plates while retaining sufficient hardness for press. Engravers learned to combine techniques in order to work the plates, 
                        such as combining etching by acid with engraving by incision. Mezzotint was an important approach initially in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>

                            For some publishers, the high cost of production, often combined with an expensive pursuit of celebrated contributors, became unsustainable by the <date notBefore="1840" notAfter="1849">1840s</date>,

                            After the reign of the annuals had passed, the later Victorians found it easy to mock the often run&#x2010;of&#x2010;the&#x2010;mill contents of these publications, 
                            which alternated between simpering sentiment and melodramatic horror, but the grown&#x2010;up Victorians could not so easily escape the influence of the annuals&#x02BC; images

                        <p>The &#x201C;cult of beauty&#x201D; was strikingly embodied by its red silk covering of the <title type="annual" corresp="#KEEPSAKE"><hi rend="italic">Keepsake</hi></title>, 
                        but the annuals had always been set apart from other publications by their bindings, which made them immediately desirable objects of consumption. 
                        The annuals dueled to be judged by their covers, a marketing ploy that arose from the broader mechanization of bookbinding, 
                        which shifted the responsibility and cost of permanent bindings from the consumer to the publisher. 
                        At the start of the nineteenth century, bookbinding was still a cottage industry that relied on hand tools and techniques that had remained essentially unchanged for centuries. 
                        Even small towns supported a bookbinder to replace the drab paper boards, which protected most new books in the form they came from the bookseller

                            In the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1839">1820s and 1830s</date>, however, &#x201C;machines for case binding, graining cloth and gold blocking . . . transformed binding into a factory production using assembly&#x2010;line methods&#x201D;

                        The flamboyance of the annuals&#x02BC; ready&#x2010;made bindings, therefore, as they jostled with one another in this changing and competitive market, 
                        formed the beginning of developments that would lead to the heyday of Victorian bookbinding

                        <p>When first published, <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> and <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> were covered with glazed paper boards, which were printed with a design framing the title, 
                            and enclosed by a slipcase of the same materials, likewise printed with a design&#x2014;the same or distinct from the design on the front boards

                            Since <persName corresp="#DMCK">McKitterick</persName> notes that this style of binding arose in <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName> in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries

                            perhaps its use initially for the annuals was a nod to the annuals&#x02BC; origin the German Taschenbuch. 
                            At <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName>, a well&#x2010;preserved copy of the <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1825"><date when="1825">1825</date> <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>, which 
                            retains its slipcase, exhibits distinct designs on the boards and slipcase, both in a brightly multicolored Gothic Revival style, 
                            inviting readers to discover the treasure within, while perhaps stealing a march on the rival <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not&#x02BC;s</hi></title> monochrome printed covers 
                            (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php#SMITHELDERBINDING"><title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>: Binding</ref>).</p>
                        
                        <p>If these printed and glazed paper bindings were outdone by silk in <date when="1828">1828</date>, the greater appeal presumably lay in the impression 
                            of luxuriousness, and perhaps femininity, but the gendered implications of this material are not definite. 
                            In <date when="1836">1836</date>, some copies of <persName corresp="#SR">Samuel Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s illustrated edition of his poem <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> were bound in silk

                            though those copies may have been marketed for women. In the same year when the <title type="annual" corresp="#KEEPSAKE"><hi rend="italic">Keepsake</hi></title> flamed onto the scene in red silk, 
                            <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1828"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi> for <date when="1828">1828</date></title> announced itself as newly acquired by the firm of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> 
                            by presenting leather boards embossed over the entire surface, front and back, along with gilding on the spine and in the center of the front cover. 
                            That this presentation was meant to be more sober and masculine than feminine silk may be the sense of a reviewer&#x02BC;s comment that 
                            &#x201C;substituting . . . an elegantly embossed leather binding&#x201D; constituted &#x201C;altogether an improvement on the original plan, 
                            since the slight coverings of silk or paper is [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] scarcely safe out of the drawing&#x2010;room or boudoir, 
                            and some of the contributions to the &#x2018;annuals&#x2019; entitle them to a higher stand&#x201D;

                            <persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName> has suggested that embossed leather covers may have suggested the bindings of prayer books and bibles&#x2014;the only expensively bound stock that retailers typically offered over the counter

                    <p>It is striking that an eighteen&#x2010;year&#x2010;old youth, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cousin, <persName corresp="#CTR">Charles</persName>, deemed it appropriate to present a younger boy, aged ten, with <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> as a gift. 
                        It is even more surprising that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_bridget_note.php"><persName corresp="#BR">Aunt Bridget</persName></ref> made him a gift of <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> when he was only eight,

                        However, these gifts become less surprising in view of a study by <persName corresp="#PRF">Paula R. Feldman</persName> of personal inscriptions found among a large collection of British annuals dating mostly from the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> and <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>. 
                        While findings based on a single collection must be considered tentative, the study gives sufficient grounds to question the assumption that annuals were most commonly purchased by men to present to women as a courtship gift; 
                        instead, &#x201C;literary annuals appear to have been purchased much more often as gifts between family members&#x201D;, since &#x201C;it is far more common to find inscriptions between siblings, or from parents to daughters, 
                        from aunts and uncles to nieces, and from husbands to wives&#x201D;. Thus, the presentation of an annual to <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> by an aunt or cousin would not have been considered unusual; 
                        and while <persName corresp="#PRF">Feldman</persName> finds that apparently &#x201C;it was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> permissible for a female to have given an adult male one of these volumes&#x201D;, 
                        the sampling did reveal instances of annual giving between males and (more commonly) between females (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FELDMANINSCRIPTIONS"><persName corresp="#PRF">Feldman</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#FELDMANINSCRIPTIONS">&#x201C;Women, Literary Annuals, and the Evidence of Inscriptions&#x201D;</title></ref>, 58, 57).</p>

                        <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s annual had now caught up with the technology of steel engraving for book illustration, 
                        which proved key to the success of all the annuals. As compared with softer copper, which soon lost its edge in repeated impressions, 
                        steel engraving made possible the mass production of images, and helped to satisfy the craving for pervasive, but affordable visual culture by the early&#x2010;Victorian middle class. 
                        These developments coincided with <persName corresp="#AE">Alexander Elder</persName>&#x02BC;s ambitions for <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>.

                    <p>In the Ruskins&#x02BC; family usages, the annual&#x02BC;s function as memento may have been made specifically consolitory on occasion 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#PERSONALCONNECTIONS">The Annuals and the Ruskin Family</ref>). Critics have unpacked the self&#x2010;referentiality and ironies entailed in the annual&#x02BC;s 
                        containing works that, in typical Romantic manner, derive imaginative gain from loss, while also materially embodying a memento mori in itself&#x2014;an object 
                        that the individual giver could inscribe with reference to a particular bereavement, while also laying claim to the kinds of status it conferred

                        that the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm diverted a major share of its resources into the books&#x02BC; production,

                        a new method of reproducting images that the firm had recently helped to introduce to <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>.

                            (e.g., <title type="annual" corresp="#CHRISTMASBOX"><hi rend="italic">The Christmas Box</hi></title>; <title type="annual" corresp="#JUVENILEFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">The Juvenile Forget Me Not</hi></title>), and for the religious (e.g., <title type="annual" corresp="#WINTERSWREATH"><hi rend="italic">Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi></title>), with additional titles soon targeting these subcategories as well as other niches such as the comic annual. 
                            <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> reacted to the first copy of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> to enter the household as both irreligious and lacking educational improvement for a child 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#PERSONALCONNECTIONS">The Annuals and the Ruskin Family</ref>), but no evidence indicates that the elder Ruskins 
                            steered the family consumption of annuals toward these more constrained and targeted publications. Despite <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s initial qualms, 
                            the presumed audience for the annuals could accmmmodate children of both sexes.</p>
                        <p>An example of consumption of the annuals by young girls survives from the Ruskin family library. An outlier, in that it is dated too early to have been acquired for <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s sake, 
                            the volume is a copy of <!-- title plus biblio tag --><title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1825"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> for <date when="1825">1825</date>, which was inscribed to <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s cousin, <!-- link to bio note --><ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_mary_note.php"><persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName></ref>

                            If inscribed to <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> in the year of publication, she would have been about ten years old, too young for a courtship gift. Anecdotal evidence indicates 
                            that <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> also received a copy of <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> at about the same age 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#PERSONALCONNECTIONS">The Annuals and the Ruskin Family</ref>).</p>
                        
                        <p>On this evidence, gender may have been considered irrelevant when inscribing an annual as a gift to a child; 
                            alternatively, specific content may have influenced givers&#x02BC; judgments about a volume&#x02BC;s appropriateness for a girl or for a boy. 
                            The <date when="1825">1825</date> <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1825"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> includes an engraving of a girl and her mother, in which the girl&#x02BC;s palm is being read by a gypsy fortune teller. 
                            <persName corresp="#KDH">Katherine Harris</persName> remarks that the girl&#x02BC;s body dominates the scene, thrusting the two mature women into shadowy background, 
                            and that the girl&#x02BC;s gaze is turned directly toward the viewer. That gaze, <persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName> comments, presents a rare instance in the annuals 
                            of a female subject engaging directly with the reader/spectator, rather than treating the female subject 
                            as passive and specular to be relished voyeuristically by the consumer

                        <p>One might have expected that, at ten, <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> and <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> would have been given an annual edited specifically for children,

                            By that time, both children may already have outgrown such a present. <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> would have been too advanced in adolescence, while <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>, though young enough, would have recognized as too precocious. 
                            In a broader context, research by <persName corresp="#PRF">Paula R. Feldman</persName> has revealed that gifting of annuals in general&#x2014;not just of specialized titles&#x2014;was very common among family members. 
                            While <persName corresp="#PRF">Feldman</persName> does not mention children specifically, except as recipients of school prizes, 
                            presumably children would have been included in the exchange of annuals among family members

                    <p>At the same time, viewed in a longer perspective, 
                        the landscape annual can be situated in the broader context of travel writing and illustration, 
                        in which the steel&#x2010;engraved landscape annuals formed a stage between the British copper&#x2010;engraved topographical and antiquarian magazines 
                        published <date notBefore="1770" notAfter="1819">between the last three decades of the eighteenth century and first two decades of the nineteenth</date>, 
                        and the magazines promoting the etching revival <date notBefore="1870" notAfter="1899">in the final three decades of the nineteenth century</date> 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROBERTSBRITISHARTPERIODICALS"><persName corresp="#HEROBERTS">Roberts</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#ROBERTSBRITISHARTPERIODICALS">&#x201C;British Art Periodicals of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries&#x201D;</title></ref>, 3&#x2013;4). 
                        In this context, for the Ruskins, the landscape annuals belong to the category of topographical

                        Topographical poetry, travel narrative, and landscape illustration were often included in annuals that were not specifically landscape annuals; 
                        an example is <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own first contribution to an annual, the poem

                        Unlike the illustrated literary annuals, however, which typically 
                        anthologized a miscellany of verse and prose along with illustrations of both landscapes and figures, which were contributed by a variety of writers and artists, 
                        the landscape annuals featured a single artist paired with a single writer of the letterpress. Although subordinated to the artist, 
                        the writer for a landscape annual could, like <persName corresp="#LR">Leitch Ritchie</persName>, 
                        see himself as contributing &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> sketches of his own&#x201D;

                    <p>In another characteristic venture of the period, which took advantage of steel engraving, and which was related to the gift book but less expensive, 
                        the collected poetry or prose of important or popular authors was gathered into uniformly bound volumes, typically with a single illustration serving as frontispiece for each volume. 
                        These could be budget&#x2010;priced reprints of classic texts, British or otherwise, 
                        or they could represent significant bibliographical efforts to edit or at least collect works by modern British authors.</p>

                        which were manufactured and decorated by machine separately from the text block of the book, a process that was less expensive than the the traditional handicraft

                    <p>Because these technologies enabled <orgName corresp="#JFDOVE">Dove</orgName> to print and bind in high volume without degradation of quality, 
                        he profited by selling in bulk at widely affordable prices per volume, typically ranging from three shillings sixpence to five shillings, according to an advertisement,

                        that by comparison averaged one third the cost of an annual, which typically sold at twelve shillings per copy. 
                        The affordability of these reprints of collected canonical works&#x2014;the series presented &#x201C;a fairly elastic definition of both

                        with illustration, solid binding, and pocket size, made these volumes appropriate to a child&#x02BC;s basic library. Moreover, the crispness of their presentation&#x2014;their typography was
