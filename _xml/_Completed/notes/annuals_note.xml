                <head type="title">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</head>
                <p>Literary annuals were anthologies of verse, short fiction and essays, along with pictures, which were marketed to serve as gifts and tokens of friendship. The annuals first emerged 
                    in Britain in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, based on a German model of the form, but also incorporating features of native precursors 
                    such as the almanac, album, and the eighteenth-century "pocket book" used for notes and engagements.
                    Supported by innovations in mass reproduction of images and cheapened production of specialty bindings, the annuals contributed significantly to the visual culture 
                    of early Victorian Britain. Each volume typically presented a relation between text and picture that asserted a shared "poetic" sensibility uniting the Sister Arts, 
                    with selected texts and pictures forming specifically ekphrastic pairings. Ekphrastic projects originated with the volume editor, who typically commissioned writers 
                    to respond to an engraving, rather than engaging an artist to illustrate existing tales or verse, just as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> composed his poem 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="saltzburg_apparatus.php">&#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#SALTZBURG">Saltzburg</title>&#x201D;</ref> in response to an engraved view 
                    of the city that the editor, <!-- bio note as well as persName -->Thomas Pringle, had in hand. By the time <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> began publishing his poetry in the annuals 
                    in the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>, they were a widely popular component of middle-class visual and print culture, in which the Ruskin family already participated as consumers.</p>
                <p>As tokens of endearment to be exchanged between lovers, friends, or family members, annuals were typically published toward the end of a given year, in late October or November, 
                    in time for the holiday season of Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s. Their titles therefore named the year following that of their actual publication. 
                    "For example, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s first appearance in an annual was in the volume "for" <date when="1835">1835</date>, entitled 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath: A Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present for MDCCCXXXV</hi></title></ref>, 
                    which went to press as early as <date when="1834-08">August 1834</date> (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#VIGNEPRINGLE">Vigne, <hi rend="italic">Thomas Pringle</hi></ref>, 244), 
                    in order to be available for purchase by <date notBefore="1834-11" notAfter="1834-12">November and December</date>. As Scots, the Ruskins celebrated New Year's rather than Christmas, 
                    and the family tradition came to include John's presentation of a <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="new_years_poems_note.php">New Year's poem</ref> addressed to his father. 
                    There appears no foundation for regarding this family tradition as influenced by the annuals: John's holiday poems long preceded his publications in the annuals, as a feature of the earliest juvenilia, 
                    and he continued composing personal New Year's odes independently of the poems by "J.R." for public consumption. One can imagine, however, that the family cheer occasioned by John's annual recitation 
                    was augmented by pride in his contribution to the "Christmas and New Year's Present" of Friendship's Offering, which was being exchanged in that season among thousands.</p>
                
                <div type="section" xml:id="AUDIENCE">
                    <head type="section">Children as an Audience for the Annuals</head>
                <p>The audience for annuals is often interpreted as primarily women and girls, particularly young women of courtship age (Harris, "Feminizing the Textual Body"; 
                    Lodge, "Romantic Reliquaries", 26-31); however, children apparently were regarded as appropriate readers, as well. 
                    An example of consumption of the annuals by girls survives from the Ruskin family library. An outlier, in that it is dated too early to have been acquired for John's sake, 
                    the volume is an 1825 copy of <!-- title plus biblio tag -->Friendship's Offering, which was inscribed to John's cousin, <!-- link to bio note -->Mary Richardson 
                    (see Dearden, Library of John Ruskin, 122 [no. 953]; and see also <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php#RELFEFOUNDING"><title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>: The Founding of the Annual by <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Lupton Relfe</orgName></ref>). 
                    If inscribed to Mary in the year of publication, she would have been about ten years old, too young for a courtship gift. Anecdotal evidence indicates 
                    that John also received a copy of Forget Me Not at about the same age 
                    (see <ref type="internal" target="#PERSONALCONNECTIONS">The Annuals and the Ruskin Family</ref>). Gender may therefore have been considered irrelevant 
                    when inscribing an annual as a gift to a child; alternatively, specific content may have influenced givers' judgments about a volume's appropriateness for a girl or for a boy. 
                    The 1825 Forget Me Not includes an engraving of a girl and her mother, in which the girl's palm is being read by a gypsy fortune teller. 
                    Katherine Harris, noting that the girl's body dominates the scene, thrusting the two mature women into shadowy background, and that the girl's gaze is turned directly toward the viewer, 
                    analyzes the engraving as a rare instance in the annuals of a female subject engaging directly with the reader/spectator, rather than treating the female subject 
                    as passive and specular to be relished voyeuristically by the consumer (Harris, Feminizing the Textual Body, 600-603). May not this unusual picture have influenced the giver's choice for Mary? 
                    (Booksellers enticed buyers for annuals by exhibiting selected engravings mounted on cards, until the practice was abandoned as too expensive; see 
                </p>
                    
                    <p>One might have expected that, at ten, Mary and John would have been given an annual specifically edited for children, 
                    one of the so&#x2010;called &#x201C;juvenile&#x201D; annuals. This distinct commodity began production <date notBefore="1828" notAfter="1830">between 1828 and 1830</date> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RENIERFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><persName corresp="#AR">Renier</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#RENIERFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title></ref>, 17 and see 
                        <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#HARRISINDEXANNUALS">&#x201C;Chronological Index of British and American Literary Annual Titles&#x201D;</title> in 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, ed., <title type="archive" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Forget Me Not&#x201D; Archive</hi></title></ref>). 
                        By that time Mary may have been regarded as too advanced in adolescence for such a gift; and John, though young enough, as too precocious. 
                        In a broader context, research by Paula R. Feldman has revealed that gifting of annuals was very common among family members. 
                        While Feldman does not mention children as recipients specifically, except for noting instances of presenting annuals as school prizes, 
                        the ample context of family giving, without necessarily pertaining to circumstances of courtship, opened the readership to children 
                        (Feldman, "Women, Literary Annuals, and the Evidence of Inscriptions", 54-58; and further details from these findings, see 
                        <ref type="internal" target="#PERSONALCONNECTIONS">The Annuals and the Ruskin Family</ref>). In any case, 
                        no evidence has yet emerged that <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> had any interest in the juvenile annuals 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="boyhood_books_note.php">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth</ref>). 
                        When Ruskin began writing for the annual Friendship's Offering in 1834 at age fifteen, readers would probably have assumed that the signature "J.R." belonged to an adult writer--and possibly one of unspecifiable gender, until Ruskin was able to elaborate 
                    his signature as "J.R. of Christ Church".</p>

                    <head type="section">History and Characteristics of the Annuals</head>
                    <p>The first British annual was <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title>, published by the firm of <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> in <date when="1822">1822</date>, for the holiday season of <date notBefore="1822-11" notAfter="1823-02">1822&#x2013;23</date>. 
                        As a publisher, <persName corresp="#RAP">Rudolf Ackermann</persName> (<date notBefore="1764" notAfter="1834">1764&#x2013;1834</date>) was known primarily for his high quality, extravagant topographical books, 
                        illustrated by brightly hand&#x2010;colored aquatints. For the <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title>, <persName corresp="#RAP">Ackermann</persName> hit upon a successful blend 
                        of polite and sentimental verse, tales, and engraved illustration aimed at middle&#x2010; and upper&#x2010;class consumers, especially women, 
                        who already formed the primary audience for the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm&#x02BC;s in&#x2010;house magazine, 
                        the <title type="periodical" corresp="#REPOSITORYOFARTS"><hi rend="italic">Repository of Arts</hi></title> (<date when="1809">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828">28</date>). 
                        The magazine&#x02BC;s editor, <persName corresp="#FS">Frederic Shoberl</persName> (<date notBefore="1775" notAfter="1853">1775&#x2013;1853</date>), did double duty as the editor of the <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN"><persName corresp="#JFORD">Ford</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#FORDACKERMANN"><hi rend="italic">Ackermann</hi></title></ref>, 70, 64&#x2013;65, 80&#x2013;83).
                    </p>
                    <p>According to <persName corresp="#AR">Anne Renier</persName>, <persName corresp="#RAP">Ackermann</persName> based his creation on a combination of two models, the German <hi rend="italic">Taschenbuch</hi>, and the British <hi rend="italic">pocket book</hi>. 
                        The former kind of publication modeled the literary content and illustration for which the British annuals became known, 
                        whereas the latter presented tables of useful information along with blank or illustrated pages for the owner&#x02BC;s memoranda 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RENIERFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><persName corresp="#AR">Renier</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#RENIERFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title></ref>, 5&#x2013;6). 
                        To this ancestry of the annual, <persName corresp="#KDH">Katherine Harris</persName> adds the printed traditions of the emblem book and the almanac, 
                        as well as the homemade fashions of the lady&#x02BC;s album and the scrapbook, which were compiled by hand for personal collecting, 
                        although the cover and blank pages may have been manufactured 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISBORROWING"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HARRISBORROWING">&#x201C;Borrowing, Altering, and Perfecting the Literary Annual Form&#x201D;</title></ref>).
                        (Some confusion of terms arises from the similarity between the German <hi rend="italic">Taschenbuch</hi> 
                        and the English <hi rend="italic">pocket book</hi>, both terms referring to the publications&#x02BC; portable size, 
                        but the German form was literary, whereas the English <date notBefore="1701" notAfter="1799">eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> pocket book was akin to the almanac and diary.)
                    </p>
                    <p><date notBefore="1701" notAfter="1800">Eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> pocket books resembled almanacs by including reference information, especially tables of facts that were deemed appropriate 
                        for fashionable readers, such as lists of the members of the British royalty, the crowned heads of <geogName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</geogName>, and names of other dignitaries. 
                        This convention appealed to <persName corresp="#RAP">Ackermann</persName>, since he marketed his books and art supplies primarily to leisured and wealthy clientele, 
                        and accordingly the first <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> included a &#x201C;General Summary of Houses, Families, and Persons in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Great Britain</placeName>, in <date when="1821">1821</date>&#x201D;, along with tables of other demographic 
                        information about <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#WALES">Wales</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>. 
                        This first British annual also reflected the original use of the pocket book as an engagement calendar,   
                        ornamented with a series of emblematic treatments of the twelve months, reproduced from copper engravings

                    </p>
                    <p>After the first <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title>, the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm dropped the almanac features; and according to <persName corresp="#KDH">Katherine Harris</persName>, by <date when="1825">1825</date> 
                        all annuals had abandoned presentation of fashionably useful information in favor of strictly literary and pictorial contents 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISBORROWING"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HARRISBORROWING">&#x201C;Borrowing, Altering, and Perfecting the Literary Annual Form&#x201D;</title></ref>, 7).
                        Nonetheless, the annuals reflected lasting legacies of the pocket book, characteristics that point to the original uses of the earlier ephemeral print items. 
                        One legacy was the publication schedule of pocket books, which were released on the market in the autumn for purchase as Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s presents. 
                        Pocket books, like modern calendars, usually lost value after the beginning of the New Year, 
                        and it was to avoid this obsolescence that the almanac material was dropped from the early annuals

                        For example, in an early volume of the annual, <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>, the editor, <persName corresp="#TKH">T. K. Hervey</persName>,

                        for one season of the year than another&#x201D; and to raise the production above the annuals&#x02BC; &#x201C;toy&#x2010;like attributes&#x201D;

                        Nonetheless, the annuals retained the pattern of publishing in the autumn of one year a title that was meant &#x201C;for&#x201D; the following year. 
                        Thus, the first <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not: A Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present for <date when="1823">1823</date></hi></title> was published in <date when="1822-10">October 1822</date>

                        <!-- TAG HERE -->As Sara Lodge comments, the annuals reflected a paradox of Romanticism itself by embodyihg both newness and memory, novelty and contancy, popularity and constancy;

                        inviting the reader, in Leigh Hunt's words prefacing the Literary Pocket-Book; or, Companion for the Lover of Nature and Art (1818), 
                        to mark each passing day with a "little homage . . . to a favourite writer or artist" and "discuss the influence he has had upon taste and opinion" 
                        (quoted in Lodge, "Romantic Reliquaries", 24, and see 24-25; see also Bentley, "Leigh Hunt's 'Literary Pocket-Book', 1818-22").<!-- END HERE; RESUME BELOW -->

                    <p>Another legacy of the pocket book was consumers&#x02BC; perception of this niche of print culture as representing elegant, but not costly mementos. 
                        In the case of a shrewdly produced and marketed pocket book, 
                        such as <title type="manual_guide" corresp="#ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS"><hi rend="italic">The Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</hi></title> (<date when="1779">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1826">1826</date>), an ephemeral publication anticipated uses of the literary annual 
                        by presenting the possibility of a permanent keepsake. The publisher commissioned sophisticated, historical&#x2010; or literary&#x2010;themed engravings that were worth preserving, 
                        and the pocket book was available in a range of bindings, from functional to elegant. 
                        Owners, too, transformed the ephemeral publication into a keepsake, by dedicating the diary pages to memoranda more lasting than notes about engagements, 
                        and in some cases by decorating copies with precious handmade coverings, presumably to serve as personal gifts

                        With the addition of embellishments to the diary pages, such as vignettes on literary themes heading the otherwise blank pages of the 
                        <title type="manual_guide" corresp="#ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</hi></title>, pocket books of this class were produced well into the <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1899">nineteenth century</date>, 
                        and they even began themselves to feature literary content in response to&#x2014;and even anticipating&#x2014;the impact of the annuals.

                    <p>In the Ruskins&#x02BC; family usages, the annual&#x02BC;s function as memento may have been made specifically consolitory on occasion 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#PERSONALCONNECTIONS">The Annuals and the Ruskin Family</ref>). Critics have unpacked the self-referentiality and ironies entailed in the annual's 
                        containing works that, in typical Romantic manner, derive imaginative gain from loss, while also materially embodying a memento mori in itself--an object 
                        that the individual giver could inscribe with reference to a particular bereavement, while also laying claim to the kinds of status it conferred 
                        (Lodge, "Romantic Relinquaries"; Mour&#x00E3;o, "Remembrance of Things Past"). It would not have been a stretch for the annuals often to serve this function.

                        Based on the proven success of these formulas, the popularity of these first volumes of <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> proved so overwhelming  
                        that the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm diverted a major share of its resources into the books&#x02BC; production, 
                        consequently relinquishing experiments with lithography, 
                        a new method of reproducting images that the firm had recently helped to introduce to <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>.

                        new annuals proliferated exponentially, surviving the depression in the book trade caused not only by the panic of <date when="1826">1826</date> but also the Reform agitation

                        For some publishers, the high cost of production, often combined with an expensive pursuit of celebrated contributors, became unsustainable by the <date notBefore="1840" notAfter="1849">1840s</date>,

                        After the reign of the annuals had passed, the later Victorians found it easy to mock the often run&#x2010;of&#x2010;the&#x2010;mill contents of these publications, 
                        which alternated between simpering sentiment and melodramatic horror, but the grown&#x2010;up Victorians could not so easily escape the influence of the annuals&#x02BC; images

                       intaglio printing from a steel plate. Typically, the steel plate was covered with an etching ground, 
                       which was engraved by an etching needle in preparation for etching by acid, and then the image was further worked using a burin. 
                       Because steel is much harder than copper, its durability increased the viability of print runs to the thousands of impressions,

                    <p>Another feature of the annuals that set apart these publications as especially desirable consumer items was their rich bindings. 
                        The first annuals were covered with glazed paper boards that were printed with a design framing the title, 
                        and the volumes were protected by a slipcase of the same materials and printed design. By the 
                        <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1829">final quarter of the 1820s</date>, these paper and cloth bindings were being outdone by silk, 
                        which was regarded as not only a luxurious and feminine material but also as supplanting the need for a slipcase. 
                        In <date when="1827">1827</date>, however, all this showiness was trumped by 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></ref>, 
                        which announced itself as newly acquired by the firm of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> by boasting embossed leather boards.

                        were called <hi rend="italic">arabesque</hi>, incorporating floral and other pictorial elements. The arabesque pattern 
                        was distinguished from <hi rend="italic">cathedral</hi> patterns, which were associated with devotional publications. 
                        A cheaper alternative means of embossing was to employ 
                        <hi rend="italic">engine&#x2010;turned</hi> designs, resulting in the fine&#x2010;lined ornaments developed originally for bank notes. 
                        But by the <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1829">final quarter of the 1820s</date>, arabesque designs could as well be produced by machine 
                        (pp. 10&#x2013;13, and see 7&#x2013;14). 
                        Indeed, the flamboyance, yet relative inexpensiveness, of these bindings, which anticipate the ornate fancifulness 
                        achieved in the heyday of Victorian bookbinding, 
                        the <date notBefore="1860" notAfter="1879">1860s&#x2013;70s</date>, indicates how suddenly factory modes of production had transformed a cottage industry 
                        that, at the start of the nineteenth century, had remained essentially unchanged for centuries

                    <p>It is striking that an eighteen&#x2010;year&#x2010;old youth, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cousin, <persName corresp="#CTR">Charles</persName>, deemed it appropriate to present a younger boy, aged ten, with <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> as a gift. 
                        It is even more surprising that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_bridget_note.php"><persName corresp="#BR">Aunt Bridget</persName></ref> made him a gift of <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> when he was only eight,

                        However, these gifts become less surprising in view of a study by Paula R. Feldman of personal inscriptions found among a large collection of British annuals dating mostly from the 1820s and 1830s. 
                        While findings based on a single collection must be considered tentative, the study gives sufficient grounds to question the assumption that annuals were most commonly purchased by men to present to women as a courtship gift; 
                        instead, "literary annuals appear to have been purchased much more often as gifts between family members", since "it is far more common to find inscriptions between siblings, or from parents to daughters, 
                        from aunts and uncles to nieces, and from husbands to wives". Thus, the presentation of an annual to John by an aunt or cousin would not have been considered unusual; 
                        and while Feldman finds that apparently "it was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> permissible for a female to have given an adult male one of these volumes", 
                        the sampling did reveal instances of annual giving between males and (more commonly) between females (Feldman, "Women, Literary Annuals, and the Evidence of Inscriptions", 58, 57).</p>

                        <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s annual had now caught up with the technology of steel engraving for book illustration,

                        steel engraving made possible the mass production of images, and helped to satisfy the craving for pervasive, but affordable visual culture by the early&#x2010;Victorian middle class.

                        offers of cash that were so princely that he fatally strained relations with 
                        his publishers, the firms of <orgName corresp="#JENNINGS">Robert Jennings</orgName> and of 
                        <orgName corresp="#HURST">Hurst, Chance</orgName>. These ambitious schemes suggest that <persName corresp="#CTH">Heath</persName> was interested less in promoting 
                        landscape art per se than in promoting and rewarding himself, rather than 
                        publishers, with the proceeds of his talent for steel engraving; however,

                        at least incidentally with the development of the 
                        landscape annual as a class (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED"><hi rend="italic">Steel&#x2010;Engraved Book Illustration in England</hi></ref>,

                        imitators, such as the <title type="annual" corresp="#CONTINENTALANNUAL1832"><hi rend="italic">Continental Annual and Romantic Cabinet</hi></title>, published in <date when="1832">1832</date> by

                    </p>
                    <p>At the same time, viewed in a longer perspective, 
                        the landscape annual can be situated in the broader context of travel writing and illustration, 
                        in which the steel&#x2010;engraved landscape annuals formed a stage between the British copper&#x2010;engraved topographical and antiquarian magazines 
                        published <date notBefore="1770" notAfter="1819">between the last three decades of the eighteenth century and first two decades of the nineteenth</date>, 
                        and the magazines promoting the etching revival <date notBefore="1870" notAfter="1899">in the final three decades of the nineteenth century</date> 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROBERTSBRITISHARTPERIODICALS"><persName corresp="#HEROBERTS">Roberts</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#ROBERTSBRITISHARTPERIODICALS">&#x201C;British Art Periodicals of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries&#x201D;</title></ref>, 3&#x2013;4). 
                        In this context, for the Ruskins, the landscape annuals belong to the category of topographical 
                        poetry and prose, such as <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> by 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="rogers_samuel_note.php"><persName corresp="#SR">Samuel Rogers</persName> (<date notBefore="1763" notAfter="1855">1763&#x2013;1855</date>)</ref>; 
                        pictorial travelogues, with or without letterpress, such as 
                        <title type="artwork" corresp="#PROUTSKETCHES"><hi rend="italic">Facsimiles of Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany</hi></title> by 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="prout_samuel_note.php"><persName corresp="#SP">Samuel Prout</persName> (<date when="1783">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852">1852</date>)</ref>; 
                        and <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="travel_narratives_and_guidebooks_note.php">Travel Narratives and Guidebooks</ref>. 
                        Topographical poetry, travel narrative, and landscape illustration were often included in annuals that were not specifically landscape annuals; 
                        an example is <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own first contribution to an annual, the poem 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="saltzburg_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</ref>, published in <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>. 
                        Unlike the illustrated literary annuals, however, which typically 
                        anthologized a miscellany of verse and prose along with illustrations of both landscapes and figures, which were contributed by a variety of writers and artists, 
                        the landscape annuals featured a single artist paired with a single writer of the letterpress. Although subordinated to the artist, 
                        the writer for a landscape annual could, like <persName corresp="#LR">Leitch Ritchie</persName>, 
                        see himself as contributing &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> sketches of his own&#x201D; 
                        (qtd. in  <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED"><persName corresp="#BH">Hunnisett</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED"><hi rend="italic">Steel&#x2010;Engraved Book Illustration in England</hi></title></ref>, 147).

                        <p>The gift book shared features with the annual, such as steel-engraved illustrations and elaborate bindings, but differed in being produced only once. 
                            Typically, these embellishments were lavished on a previously published text (Harris, "Feminizing the Textual Body", 580 n. 13)

                    <p>Another illustrated publication of the period, one that shared the medium of steel engraving with the annuals, but not their fancy bindings, 
                        was the collected edition of poetry or prose by a British author, gathered into uniformly bound volumes, which were solidly but inexpensively produced. 
                        The Ruskins had first&#x2010;hand experience of these editions in the <title type="series" corresp="#SCOTTMAGNUM">Magnum Opus</title> of <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>, 
                        which started the trend, and they witnessed the failed attempt by

                        to complete such an edition of the <title type="book" corresp="#HOGGALTRIVETALES"><hi rend="italic">Altrive Tales</hi></title>. In order to economize, these editions featured only a few illustrations per volume, 
                        but publishers made up the deficiency by selling portfolios of prints, which collectors could bind either separately or along with the uniform edition in question
