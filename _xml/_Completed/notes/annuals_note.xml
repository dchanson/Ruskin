                <div type="section" xml:id="ANNUALS">
                    <head type="section">Annuals</head>
                <p>Literary annuals were anthologies of verse, short fiction and essays, along with pictures, which were marketed to serve as gifts and tokens of friendship. The annuals first emerged 
                    in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, based on a German model of the form, but also incorporating features of native precursors 
                    such as the almanac, album, and the <date notBefore="1700" notAfter="1799">eighteenth-century</date> &#x201C;pocket book&#x201D; used for notes and engagements.
                    Supported by innovations in mass reproduction of images and cheapened production of specialty bindings, the annuals contributed significantly to the visual culture 
                    of early Victorian <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>.</p>
                
                    <p>The annuals were ekphrastic anthologies, presenting a relation between text and picture that, following a typical Romantic&#x2010;era aesthetic, 
                    asserted a shared &#x201C;poetic&#x201D; sensibility uniting the Sister Arts 
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php#POETRYOFSISTERARTS"><title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>: The Poetry of the Sister Arts in the <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName> Annual</ref>). 
                    Ekphrastic projects originated with the volume editor, who typically commissioned writers 
                    to respond to an engraving, rather than engaging an artist to illustrate existing tales or verse, just as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> composed his poem 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="saltzburg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title></ref> in response to an engraved view 
                    of the city that the editor, <!-- bio note as well as persName. --><ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="pringle_thomas_note.php"><persName corresp="#TP">Thomas Pringle</persName></ref>, had in hand. By the time <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> began publishing his poetry in the annuals 
                        in the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>, they were a widely popular component of middle&#x2010;class visual and print culture, in which the Ruskin family already participated as consumers.</p>
                
                <p>As tokens of endearment to be exchanged between lovers, friends, or family members, annuals were typically published toward the end of a given year, in late October or November, 
                    in time for the holiday season of Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s. Their titles therefore named the year following that of their actual publication. 
                    For example, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s first appearance in an annual was in the volume &#x201C;for&#x201D; <date when="1835">1835</date>, entitled 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath: A Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present for MDCCCXXXV</hi></title></ref>, 
                    which went to press as early as <date when="1834-08">August 1834</date> (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#VIGNEPRINGLE"><persName corresp="#RV">Vigne</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#VIGNEPRINGLE"><hi rend="italic">Thomas Pringle</hi></title></ref>, 244), 
                    in order to be available for purchase by <date notBefore="1834-11" notAfter="1834-12">November and December</date>.</p>
                
                    <p>Because the Ruskins were Scots, they celebrated New Year&#x02BC;s rather than Christmas, 
                        and the family tradition included <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s presentation of a <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="new_years_poems_note.php">New Year&#x02BC;s poem</ref> addressed to his father 
                    from almost the earliest time when he could manage a pencil. 
                    There appears no foundation for regarding this family tradition as influenced by the annuals: <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s holiday poems long preceded his publications in the annuals, as a feature of the earliest juvenilia, 
                        and he continued composing personalized New Year&#x02BC;s odes for the family independently of the poems by <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">&#x201C;J.R.&#x201D;</persName> that were printed for public consumption. One can imagine, however, that the family cheer occasioned by <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s annual recitation of a New Year&#x02BC;s ode at the dinner table 
                        was augmented by pride in his contribution to the <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1830">&#x201C;Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present&#x201D;</title> of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>, which was being exchanged in that season among thousands.</p>

                    <p>The first British annual was <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title>, published by the firm of <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> in <date when="1822">1822</date>, for the holiday season of <date notBefore="1822-11" notAfter="1823-02">1822&#x2013;23</date>. 
                        As a publisher, <persName corresp="#RAP">Rudolf Ackermann</persName> (<date notBefore="1764" notAfter="1834">1764&#x2013;1834</date>) was known primarily for his high quality, extravagant topographical books, 
                        illustrated by brightly colored aquatints. For the <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title>, <persName corresp="#RAP">Ackermann</persName> hit upon a successful blend 
                        of polite and sentimental verse, tales, and engraved illustration aimed at middle&#x2010; and upper&#x2010;class consumers, especially women, 
                        who already formed the primary audience for the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm&#x02BC;s in&#x2010;house magazine, 
                        the <title type="periodical" corresp="#REPOSITORYOFARTS"><hi rend="italic">Repository of Arts</hi></title> (<date notBefore="1809" notAfter="1828">1809&#x2013;28</date>). 
                        The magazine&#x02BC;s editor, <persName corresp="#FS">Frederic Shoberl</persName> (<date notBefore="1775" notAfter="1853">1775&#x2013;1853</date>), did double duty as the editor of the <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN"><persName corresp="#JFORD">Ford</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#FORDACKERMANN"><hi rend="italic">Ackermann</hi></title></ref>, 70, 64&#x2013;65, 80&#x2013;83).</p>
                        
                        <div type="sub-subsection" xml:id="PRCURSORS">
                            <head type="sub-subsection">Precursors of the Annuals</head>
                    <p>According to <persName corresp="#AR">Anne Renier</persName>, <persName corresp="#RAP">Ackermann</persName> based his creation on a combination of two models, the German <hi rend="italic">Taschenbuch</hi>, and the British <hi rend="italic">pocket book</hi>. 
                        The former kind of publication modeled the literary content and illustration for which the British annuals became known, 
                        whereas the latter presented tables of useful information along with blank or illustrated pages for the owner&#x02BC;s memoranda 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RENIERFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><persName corresp="#AR">Renier</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#RENIERFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title></ref>, 5&#x2013;6). 
                        To this ancestry of the annual, <persName corresp="#KDH">Katherine Harris</persName> adds the printed traditions of the emblem book and the almanac, 
                        as well as the homemade fashions of the lady&#x02BC;s album and the scrapbook, which were compiled by hand for personal collecting, 
                        although the cover and blank pages may have been manufactured 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISBORROWING"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HARRISBORROWING">&#x201C;Borrowing, Altering, and Perfecting the Literary Annual Form&#x201D;</title></ref>).
                        (Some confusion of terms arises from the similarity between the German <hi rend="italic">Taschenbuch</hi> 
                        and the English <hi rend="italic">pocket book</hi>, both terms referring to the publications&#x02BC; portable size, 
                        but the German form was literary, whereas the English <date notBefore="1700" notAfter="1799">eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> pocket book was akin to the almanac and diary.)
                    </p>
                    <p><date notBefore="1700" notAfter="1799">Eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> pocket books resembled almanacs by including reference information, especially tables of facts that were deemed appropriate 
                        for fashionable readers, such as lists of the members of the British royalty, the crowned heads of <geogName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</geogName>, and names of other dignitaries. 
                        This convention appealed to <persName corresp="#RAP">Ackermann</persName>, since he marketed his books and art supplies primarily to leisured and wealthy clientele, 
                        and accordingly the first <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> included a &#x201C;General Summary of Houses, Families, and Persons in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Great Britain</placeName>, in <date when="1821">1821</date>&#x201D;, along with tables of other demographic 
                        information about <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#WALES">Wales</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>. 
                        This first British annual also reflected the original use of the pocket book as an engagement calendar,   
                        being ornamented with a series of emblematic treatments of the twelve months, reproduced from copper engravings

                    </p>
                    <p>After the first <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title>, the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm dropped the almanac features; and according to <persName corresp="#KDH">Katherine Harris</persName>, by <date when="1825">1825</date> 
                        all annuals had abandoned almanac&#x2010; and diary&#x2010;like elements in favor of strictly literary and pictorial contents 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISBORROWING"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HARRISBORROWING">&#x201C;Borrowing, Altering, and Perfecting the Literary Annual Form&#x201D;</title></ref>, 7). 
                        Along the way to this stabilization of annuals in shared elements of early Victorian ekphrastic print culture, transitional publications eshibited devices of engaging a Romantic&#x2010;era reader. 
                        As <persName corresp="#SLODGE">Sara Lodge</persName> has shown, pocket books published shortly prior 
                        to <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> 
                        combined features of the diary and almanac with the literary and artistic anthology, with the aim 
                        of inviting reader response. In the words of <persName corresp="#JHLH">Leigh Hunt</persName> prefacing the 
                        <title type="book" corresp="HUNTSLITERARYPOCKETBOOK"><hi rend="italic">Literary Pocket&#x2010;Book; or, Companion for the Lover of Nature and Art</hi></title> 
                        (<date notBefore="1818" notAfter="1822">1818&#x2013;22</date>), 
                        the reader was encouraged to mark each passing day with a &#x201C;little homage . . . to a favourite writer or artist&#x201d; and to &#x201C;discuss the influence he has had upon taste and opinion&#x201d;. 
                        The result would be the owner&#x02BC;s own &#x201C;Calendar of Nature&#x201D; in place of a calendar of royalty 
                        (quoted in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LODGEROMANTICRELIQUARIES"><persName corresp="#SLODGE">Lodge</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="LODGEROMANTICRELIQUARIES">&#x201C;Romantic Reliquaries&#x201D;</title></ref>, 25;

                            <p>Similarly, the <title type="manual_guide" corresp="#ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</hi></title> (<date notBefore="1779" notAfter="1826">1779&#x2013;1826</date>) invited the user to transform an ephemeral pocket book

                                and offered a range of bindings, from functional to elegant. Some owners dedicated the diary pages to memoranda more lasting than notes about engagements, 
                                and decorated their copies with handmade coverings, presumably to serve as personal gifts

                            <p>As the literary annuals abandoned the features of the pocket book that invited readers to leave material traces of their creative engagement, 
                                and became what <persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName> summarizes as a &#x201C;more marketable and completely prefabricated book of printed memories&#x201D;

                                The annuals took over the publication schedule of pocket books, requiring release on the market in late October or November 
                                in time for purchase as Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s presents. Also like pocket books and almanacs, 
                                annuals lost perceived value as gifts after the beginning of the New Year; however, unlike their precursors, annuals were meant to be kept as permanent remembrances. 
                                They were elegant, but, at a base selling point of twelve shillings, affordable keepsakes, apart from more costly annuals produced for the high&#x2010;end market

                        For example, in an early volume of the annual, <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>, the editor, <persName corresp="#TKH">T. K. Hervey</persName>,

                        Nonetheless, the annuals retained the pattern of publishing in the autumn of one year a title that was meant &#x201C;for&#x201D; the following year.

                        was soon to be displaced by more durable steel engraving, which would allow for much larger press runs; and the very inclusion of a monthly calendar hearkened

                       intaglio printing from a steel plate. Typically, the steel plate was covered with an etching ground, 
                       which was engraved by an etching needle in preparation for etching by acid, and then the image was further worked using a burin. 
                       Because steel is much harder than copper, its durability increased the viability of print runs to the thousands of impressions, 
                       compared to the few hundreds of impressions possible from a copper plate, 
                       which rapidly wore thin from the abrasion of wiping

                       While copper rapidly yields lighter and dimmer impressions, its more pliable surface is easier to engrave than stubborn steel; 
                       and therefore innovations were required to make steel practicable for this use, 
                       such as softening the steel for engraving and then hardening the plate. 
                       With these developments, the art grew rapidly in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>

                       the literary annuals were among the first kinds of publications to profit from the new technique.

                    <p>Another feature of the annuals that set apart these publications as especially desirable consumer items was their rich bindings. 
                        The first annuals were covered with glazed paper boards that were printed with a design framing the title, 
                        and the volumes were protected by a slipcase of the same materials and printed design. By the 
                        <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1829">final quarter of the 1820s</date>, these paper and cloth bindings were being outdone by silk, 
                        which was regarded as not only a luxurious and feminine material but also as supplanting the need for a slipcase. 
                        In <date when="1827">1827</date>, however, all this showiness was trumped by 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></ref>, 
                        which announced itself as newly acquired by the firm of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> by boasting embossed leather boards. 
                        As <persName corresp="#EJ">Eleanore Jamieson</persName> explains in

                        were called <hi rend="italic">arabesque</hi>, incorporating floral and other pictorial elements. The arabesque pattern 
                        was distinguished from <hi rend="italic">cathedral</hi> patterns, which were associated with devotional publications. 
                        A cheaper alternative means of embossing was to employ 
                        <hi rend="italic">engine&#x2010;turned</hi> designs, resulting in the fine&#x2010;lined ornaments developed originally for bank notes. 
                        But by the <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1829">final quarter of the 1820s</date>, arabesque designs could as well be produced by machine 
                        (pp. 10&#x2013;13, and see 7&#x2013;14). 
                        Indeed, the flamboyance, yet relative inexpensiveness, of these bindings, which anticipate the ornate fancifulness 
                        achieved in the heyday of Victorian bookbinding, 
                        the <date notBefore="1860" notAfter="1879">1860s&#x2013;70s</date>, indicates how suddenly factory modes of production had transformed a cottage industry 
                        that, at the start of the nineteenth century, had remained essentially unchanged for centuries

                            Within five years of publication of the first British annual, this presumed middle&#x2010;class female audience begins to splinter with the emergence of specialized annuals for children

                            Famously, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> reacted to the first copy of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> to enter the household as both irreligious and lacking educational improvement for a child 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#PERSONALCONNECTIONS">The Annuals and the Ruskin Family</ref>), but no evidence indicates that the elder Ruskins 
                            steered the family consumption of annuals toward these more constrained and targeted publications. Despite <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s initial qualms, 
                            the presumed audience for the annuals could accmmmodate children of both sexes.</p>

                            An example of consumption of the annuals by young girls survives from the Ruskin family library. An outlier, in that it is dated too early to have been acquired for <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s sake,

                            If inscribed to <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> in the year of publication, she would have been about ten years old, too young for a courtship gift. Anecdotal evidence indicates

                        <p>On this evidence, gender may have been considered irrelevant when inscribing an annual as a gift to a child; 
                            alternatively, specific content may have influenced givers&#x02BC; judgments about a volume&#x02BC;s appropriateness for a girl or for a boy.

                            <persName corresp="#KDH">Katherine Harris</persName> remarks that the girl&#x02BC;s body dominates the scene, thrusting the two mature women into shadowy background, 
                            and that the girl&#x02BC;s gaze is turned directly toward the viewer. That gaze, <persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName> comments, presents a rare instance in the annuals 
                            of a female subject engaging directly with the reader/spectator, rather than treating the female subject 
                            as passive and specular to be relished voyeuristically by the consumer

                            a uniformity of character seems inevitable given the editorial aversion to controversy that characterized the annuals&#x02BC; production from their birth.

                            For some publishers, the high cost of production, often combined with an expensive pursuit of celebrated contributors, became unsustainable by the <date notBefore="1840" notAfter="1849">1840s</date>,

                            After the reign of the annuals had passed, the later Victorians found it easy to mock the often run&#x2010;of&#x2010;the&#x2010;mill contents of these publications, 
                            which alternated between simpering sentiment and melodramatic horror, but the grown&#x2010;up Victorians could not so easily escape the influence of the annuals&#x02BC; images

                    <p>It is striking that an eighteen&#x2010;year&#x2010;old youth, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cousin, <persName corresp="#CTR">Charles</persName>, deemed it appropriate to present a younger boy, aged ten, with <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> as a gift. 
                        It is even more surprising that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_bridget_note.php"><persName corresp="#BR">Aunt Bridget</persName></ref> made him a gift of <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> when he was only eight,

                        However, these gifts become less surprising in view of a study by <persName corresp="#PRF">Paula R. Feldman</persName> of personal inscriptions found among a large collection of British annuals dating mostly from the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> and <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>. 
                        While findings based on a single collection must be considered tentative, the study gives sufficient grounds to question the assumption that annuals were most commonly purchased by men to present to women as a courtship gift; 
                        instead, &#x201C;literary annuals appear to have been purchased much more often as gifts between family members&#x201D;, since &#x201C;it is far more common to find inscriptions between siblings, or from parents to daughters, 
                        from aunts and uncles to nieces, and from husbands to wives&#x201D;. Thus, the presentation of an annual to <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> by an aunt or cousin would not have been considered unusual; 
                        and while <persName corresp="#PRF">Feldman</persName> finds that apparently &#x201C;it was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> permissible for a female to have given an adult male one of these volumes&#x201D;, 
                        the sampling did reveal instances of annual giving between males and (more commonly) between females (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FELDMANINSCRIPTIONS"><persName corresp="#PRF">Feldman</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#FELDMANINSCRIPTIONS">&#x201C;Women, Literary Annuals, and the Evidence of Inscriptions&#x201D;</title></ref>, 58, 57).</p>

                        <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s annual had now caught up with the technology of steel engraving for book illustration, 
                        which proved key to the success of all the annuals. As compared with softer copper, which soon lost its edge in repeated impressions, 
                        steel engraving made possible the mass production of images, and helped to satisfy the craving for pervasive, but affordable visual culture by the early&#x2010;Victorian middle class. 
                        These developments coincided with <persName corresp="#AE">Alexander Elder</persName>&#x02BC;s ambitions for <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>.

                    <p>In the Ruskins&#x02BC; family usages, the annual&#x02BC;s function as memento may have been made specifically consolitory on occasion 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#PERSONALCONNECTIONS">The Annuals and the Ruskin Family</ref>). Critics have unpacked the self&#x2010;referentiality and ironies entailed in the annual&#x02BC;s 
                        containing works that, in typical Romantic manner, derive imaginative gain from loss, while also materially embodying a memento mori in itself&#x2014;an object 
                        that the individual giver could inscribe with reference to a particular bereavement, while also laying claim to the kinds of status it conferred 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LODGEROMANTICRELIQUARIES"><persName corresp="#SLODGE">Lodge</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#LODGEROMANTICRELIQUARIES">&#x201C;Romantic Relinquaries&#x201D;</title></ref>; <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MOURAOREMEMBRANCE"><persName corresp="#MMOURAO">Mour&#x00E3;o</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#MOURAOREMEMBRANCE">&#x201C;Remembrance of Things Past&#x201D;</title></ref>). It would not have been a stretch for the annuals often to serve this function.

                        As <persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName> has discovered, <persName corresp="#RAP">Ackermann</persName> modeled the <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> 
                        more closely than he acknowledged on a particular <hi rend="italic">Taschenbuch</hi>, the <title type="annual" corresp="#VERGISSMEINNICHT"><hi rend="italic">Vergissmeinnicht</hi></title>, edited by

                        Based on the proven success of these formulas, the popularity of these first volumes of <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> proved so overwhelming  
                        that the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm diverted a major share of its resources into the books&#x02BC; production, 
                        consequently relinquishing experiments with lithography, 
                        a new method of reproducting images that the firm had recently helped to introduce to <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>. 
                        <persName corresp="#RAP">Ackermann</persName> turned over the opportunity to develop the new technology to <persName corresp="#CH">Charles Hullmandel</persName> (see

                        <persName corresp="#RAP">Ackermann</persName>&#x02BC;s success and increased production immediately inspired other publishers to enter the field with their own annual. The first imitator was

                    <p>At the same time, viewed in a longer perspective, 
                        the landscape annual can be situated in the broader context of travel writing and illustration, 
                        in which the steel&#x2010;engraved landscape annuals formed a stage between the British copper&#x2010;engraved topographical and antiquarian magazines 
                        published <date notBefore="1770" notAfter="1819">between the last three decades of the eighteenth century and first two decades of the nineteenth</date>, 
                        and the magazines promoting the etching revival <date notBefore="1870" notAfter="1899">in the final three decades of the nineteenth century</date> 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROBERTSBRITISHARTPERIODICALS"><persName corresp="#HEROBERTS">Roberts</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#ROBERTSBRITISHARTPERIODICALS">&#x201C;British Art Periodicals of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries&#x201D;</title></ref>, 3&#x2013;4). 
                        In this context, for the Ruskins, the landscape annuals belong to the category of topographical 
                        poetry and prose, such as <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> by

                        an example is <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own first contribution to an annual, the poem 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="saltzburg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</title></ref>, published in <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>. 
                        Unlike the illustrated literary annuals, however, which typically 
                        anthologized a miscellany of verse and prose along with illustrations of both landscapes and figures, which were contributed by a variety of writers and artists, 
                        the landscape annuals featured a single artist paired with a single writer of the letterpress. Although subordinated to the artist, 
                        the writer for a landscape annual could, like <persName corresp="#LR">Leitch Ritchie</persName>, 
                        see himself as contributing &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> sketches of his own&#x201D;

                        <p>The gift book shared features with the annual, such as steel&#x2010;engraved illustrations and elaborate bindings, but differed in being produced only once. 
                            Typically, these embellishments were lavished on a previously published text (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISFEMINIZING"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HARRISFEMINIZING">&#x201C;Feminizing the Textual Body&#x201D;</title></ref>, 580 n. 13)

                    <p>Another illustrated publication of the period, one that shared the medium of steel engraving with the annuals, but not their fancy bindings, 
                        was the collected edition of poetry or prose by a British author, gathered into uniformly bound volumes, which were solidly but inexpensively produced. 
                        The Ruskins had first&#x2010;hand experience of these editions in the <title type="series" corresp="#SCOTTMAGNUM">Magnum Opus</title> of <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>, 
                        which started the trend, and they witnessed the failed attempt by

                        to complete such an edition of the <title type="book" corresp="#HOGGALTRIVETALES"><hi rend="italic">Altrive Tales</hi></title>. In order to economize, these editions featured only a few illustrations per volume, 
                        but publishers made up the deficiency by selling portfolios of prints, which collectors could bind either separately or along with the uniform edition in question
