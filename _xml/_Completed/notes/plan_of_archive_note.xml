                <p>The archive <hi rend="italic">Early Ruskin Manuscripts</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>)
                    contains, at the most fundamental level, two sets of edited primary materials: 
                    <hi rend="italic">works</hi> and <hi rend="italic">manuscripts</hi>.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>A <hi rend="italic">work</hi> in this edition consists of a discrete text 
                            by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> (e.g., a poem, an essay, a 
                            sermon, a mathematical proof), including all available witnesses of that 
                            text (each of these edited and annotated), and accompanied by the 
                            work&#x02BC;s explanatory apparatus and available facsimiles. The scope of a work may be comprised 
                            by a poem of only a few lines or by a composite&#x2010;genre project extending over many lengthy sections of verse, prose, and illustration. 
                            The edition partially excludes <ref type="internal" target="#LETTERS">letters</ref> and wholly excludes 
                            diaries, the latter being edited as part of the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRDIGITALARCHIVE"><hi rend="italic">John Ruskin Digital Archive</hi></ref>.</item>
                        <item>A <hi rend="italic">manuscript</hi> is a physical document manifesting 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s texts, 
                            represented in the archive by its own explanatory apparatus in addition to 
                            the <hi rend="italic">works</hi> that make up the manuscript.</item>
                    </list>
                <p>Organizationally, the archive turns on these basic units, 
                    as represented by a given work&#x02BC;s <ref type="internal" target="#WORKSPAGES">Work Pages</ref> 
                    and by a given manuscript&#x02BC;s <ref type="internal" target="#MANUSCRIPTPAGES">Manuscript Pages</ref>. 
                    The fundamental relation between these two kinds of units is the manuscript as container and the work as contained. 
                    For <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, however, the separate integrity of these units often posed a creative tension. 
                    He treated some manuscript notebooks as anthologies that assembled many separate works, but he also developed single works 
                    into complex, lengthy composites that usurped the borders of their manuscript witness.
                    The archive aims to represent and preserve this creative tension through its editorial methodology (see 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="editorial_rationale_note.php">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology</ref>).</p>

                        From here, the reader may choose from the list of witnesses, and read the main body of commentary on the work.

                        a section, <ref type="internal" target="#TITLE">Title</ref>, devoted to explaining <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own title or titles for the work, if any,

                            <item><hi rend="italic">Genre</hi>. Declares the work&#x02BC;s genre and provides additional relevant information, such as 
                                (in the case of poems) a brief commentary on prosody.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="italic">Manuscripts</hi>. All known physical manifestations of the work (e.g., drafts, fair copies, published versions) are listed,

                    <p>From the <ref type="internal" target="#WORKAPPARATUSPAGE">Work Apparatus Page</ref>, the reader may select available witnesses and corpora connected with the work, 
                        each of which opens a Work Text Page in Showcase, consisting of an edited transcription paired with a corresponding facsimile of the physical witness. 
                        At present, only edited transcriptions but not facsimiles are provided of commonly available printed witnesses, such as those in

                            <item><hi rend="italic">Windowpane</hi>. A facsimile and its transcript for a particular witness are tied together, and by default they appear side by side in Showcase. 
                                Using the windowpane control, however, the reader may fill the window with the facsimile alone, 
                                or with the transcript alone, and then return to the divided window.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="italic">Magnification</hi>. A pull&#x2010;down menu increases or decreases magnification of the facsimile.</item>

                                and some letters do have this status in the archive, in cases where epistles either contain a witness of a work (e.g., a verson of a poem 
                                included in a letter) or necessarily constitute a work because a letter or portion of a letter is drafted as part of a manuscript. 
                                Otherwise, since the letters were ably edited by <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName> in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><hi rend="italic">The Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 
                                this edition is referenced throughout the archive, with <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> supplying only manuscript facsimiles of letters where possible. 
                                The <ref type="internal" target="#FIGDESC">Figure descriptions</ref> for these facsimiles normally consist simply of a bibliographical reference to <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>&#x02BC;s edition,

                                requires this section in order to elaborate on a unique history.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="italic">Description</hi>. Describes physical characteristics, such as size, color, and kind of binding materials. In many cases,

                                of a manuscript notebook. Somewhat like an account of the collation of a printed work, the aim is in part to describe 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s (and, sometimes, his and/or others&#x02BC;) pagination of the manuscript,

                                In the case of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own page numbering, descriptions must often take account of some misnumbering of
                                pages and of missing pages. More analytical and historical than descriptive, however, this section must also undertake a reconstruction of 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s patterns of use of the manuscript. Some of this speculation may be reserved for the Discussion section.</item>
