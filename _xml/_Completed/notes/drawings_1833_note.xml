                    <p>Omitted from this <ref type="internal" target="#LIST">list</ref> are the drawings that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> made to illustrate <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php"><title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</title></ref>, 
                    which occupied his creative energy for about a year following the family&#x02BC;s return in <date when="1833-08-19">August 1833</date> (see <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#DATE"><title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>: Date</ref>). 
                    These illustrations are annotated separately as part of <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>&#x02BC;s edition of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>. The tour sketches are distinct from the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> illustrations in style and other features, 
                    even though <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> used the tour sketches as the basis for some of the vignette&#x2010;style illustrations. These differences are described in 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#COMPOSITEILLUSTRATEDTRAVELOGUEILLUS"><title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</title>: Missing and Unidentified Drawings for the Composite&#x2010;Genre Illustrated Travelogue (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>) and Related <date when="1833">1833</date> Tour Sketches</ref>. 
                        The <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> illustrations should be understood less as records of a tour than as imitations of the visual media developed for travel publications in the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>, 
                    which allowed British readers to consume Continental scenery at home and as preparation for traveling abroad (see 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HANSONRUSKIN1830S"><persName corresp="#DCH">Hanson</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HANSONRUSKIN1830S">&#x201C;Ruskin in the 1830s&#x201D;</title></ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself makes this distinction in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, when reviewing his <date when="1833">1833</date> drawings. On the one hand, tour sketches evolved from &#x201C;flying scrawls&#x201D; captured &#x201C;on the road&#x201D;, 
                    from which he &#x201C;made, when staying in towns, some elaborate pencil and pen outlines, 
                    of which perhaps half&#x2010;a&#x2010;dozen are worth register and preservation. My father&#x02BC;s pride in a <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833DIJON">study of the doubly&#x2010;towered Renaissance church of <placeName corresp="#DIJON">Dijon</placeName></ref> was great. 
                        A still more laborious <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPML"><placeName type="building" corresp="#HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELS">H&#x00F4;tel de Ville of Brussels</placeName></ref> remains with it at <placeName corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName>&#x201D;. 
                        Yet, however worked up at a later time, these tour drawings are distinct from illustrations produced for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> project, in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> explored the ekphrastic relation of text and the printed image. 
                        &#x201C;The <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPROUT">drawing of that <placeName type="building" corresp="#HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELS">H&#x00F4;tel de Ville</placeName></ref> by me now at <placeName corresp="#OXFORD">Oxford</placeName>&#x201D;, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> goes on to explain in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, 
                    &#x201C;is a copy of <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s, which I made in illustration of the volume in which I wrote the beginning of a rhymed history of the tour&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 35:80&#x2013;81).</p>
                    
                    
                    <p>The method of capturing passing scenes for elaboration at a later time, as described in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, does appear to be broadly supported by the evidence of the drawings themselves. 
                        A slight architectural sketch on the <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833SIXVIEWS"><title type="artwork" corresp="#JRSIXVIEWS"><hi rend="italic">Sheet of Six Swiss and Italian Views</hi></title></ref> might be credibly interpreted as a &#x201C;flying scrawl&#x201D;, 
                        but the other five drawings on the sheet, which are careful pen&#x2010;and&#x2010;ink outlines of landscape vistas, would have required a stop along the road, for which the Ruskins had no leisure. 
                        According to <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName>&#x02BC;s diary for <date when="1833-06-13">June 13</date>, for example, the family &#x201C;[r]ose at 5, breakfasted, and left immediately to cross the <geogName corresp="#SPLUGEN">Splugen</geogName>, one of the wildest and most beautiful passes of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>&#x201D;. 
                        Surely they would not have risked breaking pace during this day&#x02BC;s journey, which ended at 7:00 p.m. on the other side of the mountain at <placeName corresp="#CHIAVENNA">Chiavenna</placeName>, 
                        in order to allow <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> time to devise and outline <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833SIXVIEWS-SPLUGEN">&#x201C;On the road to <placeName corresp="#SPLUGENVILLAGE">Splugen</placeName>&#x201D;</ref> and 
                        <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833SIXVIEWS-TUSIS">&#x201C;On the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> near <placeName corresp="#THUSIS">Tusis</placeName>&#x201D;</ref>. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> must have designed these vistas later, just as <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> would have required the quiet of a hotel to compose her diary entries, which exactingly incorporate guidebook information 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT48">Diary of <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName></title>, <date when="1833">1833</date></ref>, 40&#x2013;41). In fact, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s five vistas on the sheet can be interpreted specifically as a retrospective. Already formed into oval vignettes, their lines overlap and interlock at the edges, 
                        as if to form a retrospective panorama, which advances from crossing the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> into <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>, 
                        to sighting <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833SIXVIEWS-MEDITERRANEAN">&#x201C;The <geogName corresp="#MEDITERRANEAN">Mediterranean</geogName>&#x201D;</ref> and approaching

                        to departing <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> again via the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> at <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833SIXVIEWS-DOMODOSSOLA">&#x201C;<placeName corresp="#DOMODOSSOLA">Domo d&#x02BC;Ossola</placeName>&#x201D;</ref>. 
                        The sheet constitutes a kind of moving picture.</p>
                    
                    <p>If the description in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s sketching routine is generally confirmed by the evidence, 
                        it should also be qualified and supplemented by remarks in <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName>&#x02BC;s diary. 
                        On the one hand, <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName>&#x02BC;s mention of an hour of sketching at <placeName corresp="#CASSEL">Cassel</placeName> proves that the outcome of that session, the surviving drawing (indeed, 
                        a &#x201C;laborious&#x201D; one) of <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833CASSEL"><title type="artwork" corresp="#JRHOTELDEVILLECASSEL"><hi rend="italic"><placeName type="building" corresp="#HOTELDEVILLECASSEL">Hotel de Ville, <placeName corresp="#CASSEL">Cassel</placeName></placeName></hi></title></ref>, 
                        cannot have been completed on the spot in that time. On the other hand, <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> 
                        neglects the fact that <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> and <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> spent that hour at <placeName corresp="#CASSEL">Cassel</placeName> sketching together.

                    <p>It was perhaps more typical for <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> to sketch by himself; however, <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>&#x02BC;s summary of his practice, as jotting down &#x201C;flying scrawls on the road&#x201D; 
                        to be worked up into finished drawings &#x201C;when staying in towns&#x201D;, also overlooks his on&#x2010;site sketching while <hi rend="italic">in</hi> 
                        the towns. Very early in the tour, <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> established a routine of leaving the hotel under the protection of the family&#x02BC;s courier, <persName corresp="#SALVADOR">Salvador</persName>, to sketch for an hour after breakfast, 
                        and again for an hour or two between dinner, taken around 3 p.m., and tea, taken around 6:00 or 6:30. 
                        At these times, the rest of the family would be taking a walk or shopping 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT48">Diary of <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName></title>, <date when="1833">1833</date></ref>, e.g. 5, 6, 7, 12). 
                        First mentioned at <placeName corresp="#TOURNAI">Tournai</placeName>, where <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> went out to sketch the cathedral, this routine eventually drops out of the diary&#x2014;not, one conjectures, 
                        because <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> abandoned the practice, but because it became too common to be worth noticing, whereas <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> found greater interest in describing tourist sites in dense detail. 
                        It is also possible, however, that the elder Ruskins grew wary of the environs of <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s sketching sessions, especially in larger cities, and reined in these excursions, even though accompanied by <persName corresp="#SALVADOR">Salvador</persName>.

                        <p>Despite this distinction between sources and style of the tour sketches and the illustrations, an attempt to list the tour sketches from <date when="1833">1833</date> will likely perpetuate some confusion in earlier catalogues between the two kinds of drawings&#x2014;confusion 
                            that can no longer be easily sorted out, since too little is known about drawings that cannot be traced.

                    the one perhaps most likely to have been intended for use in the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> has disappeared.

                    he describes the drawing as a copy after <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>, and not as an on&#x2010;the&#x2010;site tour sketch

                    The latter drawing appears to be <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPROUT"><title type="artwork" corresp="#JRHOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPROUT"><hi rend="italic"><placeName type="building" corresp="#HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELS">H&#x00F4;tel de Ville</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName>, after <persName corresp="#SP">Samuel Prout</persName></hi></title></ref>,

                    It would be logical to associate this drawing with the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copy of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, which presents a blank gap above the header for the section,

                    however, this <placeName corresp="#LANCASTER">Lancaster</placeName> drawing is too large to have been tipped into the gap in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>. A drawing that may have been intended for that space, 
                    one described as a <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPROUTCOPY">&#x201C;miniature&#x201D; version</ref> of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s copy after <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>,

                    by <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> is too ambiguous to distinguish the drawing definitively from the 
                    <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPROUT"><placeName corresp="#LANCASTER">Lancaster</placeName> copy after <persName corresp="SP">Prout</persName></ref> 
                    (see, for further discussion, <ref type="figure" target="brussels_hotel_de_ville_drawing_msix.php"><title type="artwork" corresp="#JRHOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPROUTCOPY"><placeName type="building" corresp="#HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELS">H&#x00F4;tel de Ville</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName></title></ref>; and

                        <p>Such ambiguities seem particularly to beset the cataloguing of drawings from the <date when="1833">1833</date> tour, because of their near relation to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s production of illustrations for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> in <date notBefore="1833" notAfter="1834">1833&#x2013;34</date>. 
                    Yet despite the subsequent difficulty in untangling the provenance of similarly described and entitled drawings, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> maintained a steady distinction&#x2014;both 
                    in the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date> when producing the drawings, and in the <date notBefore="1870" notAfter="1889">1870s&#x2013;80s</date> when exhibiting them&#x2014;between 
                    his tour sketching and his imitation of illustrated travel literature. In the case of the <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> <placeName type="building" corresp="#HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELS">H&#x00F4;tel de Ville</placeName> drawings, 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears to have imitated <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s drawing in stages, first copying the lithograph on a scale appropriate to the large original, 
                    and then reducing that copy to the scale appropriate to a steel&#x2010;engraved vignette.</p>
                    
                    <p>Another source of obscurity in distinguishing the tour sketches from the illustrations for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> may lie, not only with an inability to identify a catalogued work and trace it to its current location, 
                        but also with errors or duplications in the cataloguing itself. For example, according to the <title type="catalogue" corresp="#CATALOGUEOFRUSKINSDRAWINGSLE">&#x201C;Catalogue of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s Drawings&#x201D;</title>

                            about the core problem of distinguishing the tour sketces from the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> illustrations.

                            Just so, in the case of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <placeName type="building" corresp="#HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELS">Brussels H&#x00F4;tel de Ville</placeName> drawings, 
                            <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="catalogue" corresp="#WGCRUSKINEXHIBITION1900">catalogue</title> description of item no. 10 in the <title type="exhibition" corresp="#RUSKINEXHIBITIONCONISTON1900">Coniston Exhibition</title> claims

                            about how one should view the productions of his boyhood. For example, in a drawing now held by the <orgName corresp="#BMFA"><placeName corresp="#BOSTON">Boston</placeName> Museum of Fine Arts</orgName>,

                            If <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> meant that the sketch represented his first attempt at recording a historical monument during the tour of <date when="1833">1833</date>, he was mistaken.

                <p>The attempt to distinguish between the <date when="1833">1833</date> tour drawings and the illustrations for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> is not meant to deny any relation at all between these kinds of drawings. 
                    Sketches served as the basis for vignette illustrations, a process documented in the evolution of <ref type="figure" target="balstall_drawing_msix.php"><title type="artwork" corresp="#JRBALSTALLMSIX">Vignette after &#x201C;Ancient Fortress and Rocky peak / Above the vale of <placeName corresp="#BALSTHAL">Balstall</placeName>&#x201D;</title></ref>; 
                    and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> planned additional such adaptations of his tour sketches, as he noted in the 
                    <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php"><title type="bibliography_text" corresp="JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTSILLUS">List of Proposed Additional Contents for the <title type="composite" corresp="JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> (Table 2, Illustrations)</title></ref>, 
                    where in several instances he planned to use &#x201C;my own&#x201D; drawings to fashion illustrations (as opposed to adapting printed images by other artists). 
                    Moreover, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s creation of the tour sketches themselves cannot be separated entirely from the visual culture of travel&#x2010;related publications that he more explicitly imitated 
                    in the illustrations for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>. The influence of print culture on his tour sketching is perhaps what <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> means by remarking that he finished on&#x2010;the&#x2010;spot &#x201C;outlines&#x201D; 
                    with ideas &#x201C;out of his head&#x201D; later in the tour or at home in <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName>.</p>
                        
                        <p>Later in life, it is true, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> took little interest in the picturesque influences on his early sketches, 
                            instead valuing signs of an incipient keenness in observing nature. In <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, 
                            he singles out only &#x201C;half&#x2010;a&#x2010;dozen&#x201D; <date when="1833">1833</date> drawings as &#x201C;worth register and preservation&#x201D; for their observable landscape truth. 
                            For example, in the <date when="1878">1878</date> <title type="exhibition" corresp="#FINEARTSOCIETYRUSKINSTURNERS1878"><orgName corresp="#FINEARTSOCIETY">Fine Art Society</orgName> exhibition of his own drawings</title>, 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> showed an <date when="1833">1833</date> drawing or group of drawings described as &#x201C;a day&#x02BC;s sketching . . . between <placeName corresp="#ARONA">Arona</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#DOMODOSSOLA">Domo d&#x02BC;Ossola</placeName> on the same journey&#x201D;, 
                    which, though &#x201C;finished out of my head&#x201D; at some later time, documented attention to real landscapes. This work, which came to be catalogued as 
                            <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833MAGGIOREANDDOMODOSSOLA"><title type="artwork" corresp="#JRLAGOMAGGIOREANDDOMODOSSOLA1833"><hi rend="italic"><geogName corresp="#LAKEMAGGIORE">Lago Maggiore</geogName> and <placeName corresp="#DOMODOSSOLA">Domo d&#x02BC;Ossola</placeName></hi></title></ref>, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> considered &#x201C;interesting&#x201D; for its &#x201C;proper economy of paper&#x201D; and &#x201C;weak enthusiasm&#x201D;&#x2014;qualities that he may have connected with his youthful engagement with print culture. 
                            What prompted him to exhibit the work in <date when="1878">1878</date>, however, was its evidence of &#x201C;fastening so early&#x201D; on a landscape truth that he would illustrate over two decades later 
                            in a drawing called <title type="artwork" corresp="#JRROCKOFARONA"><hi rend="italic">The Rock of <placeName corresp="#ARONA">Arona</placeName></hi></title> made for <title type="book" corresp="#JRMODERNPAINTERS4"><hi rend="italic">Modern Painters IV</hi></title>. 
                            In the <title type="book" corresp="#JRMODERNPAINTERS4"><hi rend="italic">Modern Painters</hi></title> volume, this drawing occurs among the chapters on &#x201C;Sculpture of Mountains&#x201D; 
                            to illustrate a discussion of rocky precipices. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> traces the &#x201C;real rock lines&#x201D; that follow a &#x201C;parabolic flow&#x201D; in overhanging rock forms, arguing that, in nature, 
                            these parabolic lines trace a &#x201C;delicate overhanging&#x201D; that becomes &#x201C;cautiously diminished as [the precipice] gets higher&#x201D;. In contrast, 
                            <persName corresp="#CLAUDE">Claude Lorrain</persName> and Renaissance painters were &#x201C;fond of representing . . . overhanging of rocks with buildings on the top, 
                            and weeds drooping into the air over the edge, always thinking to get sublimity by exaggerating the projection&#x201D; of their fantastically beetling precipices

                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s later emphasis on truth&#x2010;to&#x2010;nature has influenced critics in their approach to the early tour sketches, which typically consists in sifting bona fide factual observations from the chaff of conventionality. 
                    <persName corresp="#PHW">Paul H. Walton</persName>, for example, singles out bits of &#x201C;observation&#x201D; amid the &#x201C;timid drawing style, limited at this time by eighteenth&#x2010;century conventions&#x201D;

                            Yet <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s youthful observations of nature were themselves prompted by the visual and print culture of his decade.

                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> later found in his sketches in <placeName corresp="#ARONA">Arona</placeName>, his observation may have been directed by <persName corresp="#WBI">William Brockedon</persName>&#x02BC;s

                    the viewer finds &#x201C;the overhanging precipice beneath which the route of the <geogName corresp="#SIMPLON">Simplon</geogName> passes to <placeName corresp="#ARONA">Arona</placeName>&#x201D;; as commented in the accompanying text, 
                    &#x201C;it is difficult to pass&#x201D; beneath this precipice &#x201C;without feeling an emotion of danger&#x201D;

                            the only bizarre element is injected by art, rather than nature&#x2014;the <title type="artwork" corresp="#CERANOSANCARLONE">colossal statue of <persName corresp="#CBORROMEO">St. Carlo Borromeo</persName></title>, 
                    which extends a blessing over the hills. Even this presence is omitted in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem for this section, 
                            which erases the statue but keeps the word &#x201C;colossally&#x201D;, 
                    applying it to the surrounding moutains, &#x201C;spirits of gigantic things / Lords of the earth and air and sky&#x201D;

                            Also in the emotion of <persName corresp="#WBI">Brockedon</persName>&#x02BC;s illustrated travelogue, as well as in the Ruskins&#x02BC; experience of travel, lay the realization of recent history: 
                            atop the precipice above <placeName corresp="#ARONA">Arona</placeName> stood the <placeName type="building" corresp="#ROCCADIARONA">Rocca di Arona</placeName>, an ancient fortress owned by the <orgName corresp="#HOUSEOFBORROMEO">Borromeo</orgName> family, in <date when="1800">1800</date> reduced to a ruin by <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>&#x02BC;s army.</p>
                
                        <p>These multiple and interpenetrating influences&#x2014;observation from travel, print illustration of travel, a lived awareness of history&#x2014;come together strikingly in another tour sketch,

                    Before the Ruskins departed for the <placeName corresp="#EUROPE">Continent</placeName>, a part of this scene was already vivid to them from <persName corresp="#SP">Samuel Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s lithograph,

                            Instead, the buildings in <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s picturesque scene form part of a different kind of drawing that

                        <p>Both the lithograph and the panorama were new technologies of early <date notBefore="1837-06-20" notAfter="1901-01-22">Victorian</date> visual culture, but posed a differing relation to the consumer. 
                            Lithography, as a means of reproduction, offered an intimate connection with the artist, since the medium &#x201C;multiplied originals&#x201D; drawn on the stone 
                            by the artist himself, without the intermediary of an engraver. Although in fact successful artistic lithography required codependency

                            Panorama, in contrast, was public spectacle, produced by teams of artists. The grandest was

                            to a vignette was better suited for use in the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> than was the panorama&#x2010;inspired

                            which could not be scaled down at all and remain the kind of representation it is. It is jarring, therefore, to see the buildings in <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s picturesque lithograph 
                            stationed at the left end of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s line of facades along the <geogName corresp="#MOSELLE">Moselle</geogName>, 
                            drawn in spare outline rather than in <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s crumbly textures. <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s subject,

                            and the Romanesque <placeName type="building" corresp="#FLORINSKIRCHEKOBLENZ">Florinskirche</placeName>, anchor the left end of the panorama, while, 
                            farther to the right, the city&#x02BC;s mother church, the Romanesque <placeName type="building" corresp="#LIEBFRAUENKIRCHEKOBLENZ">Liebfrauenkirche</placeName> presents its profile, 
                            recognizable by its baroque Welschen hoods capping the towers. On the right end, the panorama is framed by the <date notBefore="1201" notAfter="1300">thirteenth&#x2010;century</date> <placeName type="building" corresp="#ALTEBURG">Alte Burg (Old Castle)</placeName>, 
                            and the <placeName type="building" corresp="#BALDWINBRIDGE">Balduinbr&#x00FC;cke (Baldwin Bridge)</placeName>, 
                            which connects to the castle at a right angle to the plane of the picture, spanning the <geogName corresp="#MOSELLE">Moselle</geogName>. 
                            The drawing seems to eschew the artistic personality of <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="artwork" corresp="#PROUTSKETCHES"><hi rend="italic">Facsimiles</hi></title> or <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s vignettes for <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, and to substitute an objective overview of the medieval center of the town.</p>
                        
                        <p>At the same time, the circumstances in which the drawing was made can be interpreted as domesticating its spectacular viewpoint. 
                            <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName> noted in her diary that, after dining immediately 
                            on arrival in <placeName corresp="#COBLENZ">Koblenz</placeName>, &#x201C;<persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> 
                            and I went over both the bridges to draw, accompanied by <persName corresp="#ASB">Anne</persName> [the family nurse] and <persName corresp="#SALVADOR">Salvador</persName>&#x201D;, 
                            while &#x201C;Uncle and Aunt ascended a little hill from whence they had a fine view&#x201D;. The children&#x02BC;s view&#x2010;seeking was more ambitious: 
                            their hotel, the <placeName type="building" corresp="#CHEVALBLANC">Cheval Blanc</placeName>, stood on the east bank of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>, the <geogName corresp="#EHRENBREITSTEIN">Ehrenbreitstein</geogName> side, meaning that, to reach the viewpoint 
                            shown in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s drawing, they had to cross &#x201C;both the bridges&#x201D;&#x2014;the pontoon bridge across the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> 
                            from the <placeName corresp="#EHRENBREITSTEINVILLAGE">village of Ehrenbreitstein</placeName> to the old city of <placeName corresp="#KOBLENZ">Koblenz</placeName>; 
                            and then the stone bridge, <placeName type="building" corresp="#BALDWINBRIDGE">Balduinbr&#x00FC;cke</placeName>, across the <geogName corresp="#MOSELLE">Moselle</geogName> from the old town. 
                            Like this brave excursion, the panoramic drawing suggests the boldness of the older cousin, and perhaps her instruction or participation, 
                            since <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s drawing rather strenuously applies linear perspective. This teaching was a specialty of the drawing tutor,

                            <p>The relative scarcity of surviving <date when="1833">1833</date> drawings might not be suprising for such early drawings, were it not for the eagerness with which examples were collected and exhibited, 
                                both by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself in his infrequent exhibitions, and by his admirers in the more numerous exhibitions following soon after his death. 
                                The exhibition of these drawings in the decade after <date when="1900">1900</date> doubtless testifies to the popularity of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s autobiography, <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, 
                                in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> describes his youthful art training. More generally, however, British collecting in the <date notBefore="1875" notAfter="1900">last quarter of the nineteenth century</date> was 
                                marked by a desire for biographical and bibliographical comprehensiveness, from boyhood to maturity, whether of drawings or writings (see

                    these <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date> reproductions preserved the originals&#x02BC; dimensions. If so, the <placeName corresp="#ANDERNACH">Andernach</placeName> drawing must have been a tour drawing, 
                    since, as reproduced, its dimensions would have been too large to have served as a vignette illustration in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>. 
                    In contrast, the size and shape of the <placeName corresp="#INTERLAKEN">Interlaken</placeName> (<placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName>) drawing, as shown in reproduction, 
                    suggest that the original was intended as a vignette illustration, probably destined for the uncompleted section

                <p>It is ironic that the originals of these photogravures vanished in a process of reproduction that, in <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s characterization, was driven by a desire for authenticity. 
                    According to his <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPREFATORYNOTESPLATES">&#x201C;Prefatory Notes on the Plates&#x201D;</title> in the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><date when="1891">1891</date> edition of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title></ref>, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> along with the &#x201C;publisher, 
                    engravers, and printers&#x201D; was motivated by an &#x201C;anxiety . . . that the plates should represent the original drawings as accurately as modern skill permits&#x201D;. As a foil, 
                    <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> characterizes the &#x201C;old standard art&#x201D; of engraving used to illustrate <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s earlier books as a &#x201C;joint&#x201D; project of designer and engraver, like 
                    &#x201C;concerted music&#x201D; performed by &#x201C;players on different instruments&#x201D;. An authentic solo performance by the designer was not reproducible on a mass scale; &#x201C;it was never . . . 
                    [the artist and engraver&#x02BC;s] intention to give the style and touch of the draughtsman, his separate individuality, his momentary mood, as shown in the very material and handling 
                    of the original sketch&#x201D;. But now with the invention &#x201C;of modern photographic engraving&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> believed, 
                    this authentic individuality had come within reach of reproducibility. He regarded photogravure as an attempt &#x201C;to reproduce the master, 
                    to <hi rend="italic">facsimile</hi> the authentic document&#x201D;. This faith in photographic reproduction aligned with <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s biographically 
                    oriented editorial aims: &#x201C;this is what we want here in such pictures as rightly illustrate a collection of Poems written in Youth, 
                    in bygone historic times, recording a famous man&#x02BC;s childhood and boyhood, his first impressions and fresh ideas of the world and of life&#x201D;. Photographic engraving promises to supply 
                    &#x201C;genuine records of the traditional precocity which we should like to verify: some true measure of the progress which we suspect, but cannnot otherwise trace, by which genius was developed. 
                    We want to see <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s drawings, and not engraver&#x02BC;s plates&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS4D1891"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, <date when="1891">1891</date>]</ref>, 1:v).</p>
                
                <p>In the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS4D1891"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891">1891 <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title></ref> (large&#x2010;paper edition only, the octavo edition containing no plates), the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPREFATORYNOTESPLATES">&#x201C;Prefatory Notes on the Plates&#x201D;</title> complements the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D;</title>, 
                    but the former was placed at the front of volume one, and the latter at its end, presumably because the physical witnesses of the photogravure plates were regarded as the closest possible encounter 
                    with the actuality of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s youth. Comparatively, the edited and printed poems placed the material manuscripts at a step removed, mediated by the editor, although some compensation 
                    was afforded by photogravure reproduction of samples of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early handwriting, as well. <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> admits that &#x201C;no reproduction can be quite the same thing as an original, if the original 
                    owe any of its interest to the more subtle artistic qualities of line and tone&#x201D;. The benefit of photogravure, in <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s mind, lay in its &#x201C;mechanical reproduction by a method which, 
                    clever and charming as it is, adds nothing to . . . [the sketches&#x02BC;] cleverness and charm&#x201D;&#x2014;the mechanization assuring that what was conveyed was at least purely authentic, however deficient otherwise.
                    <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> evidently perceived no significant contradiction between this faith in mechanization and his admission that &#x201C;<orgName corresp="#WALKERANDBOUTALL">Messrs. Walker and Boutall</orgName>&#x02BC;s photogravures&#x201D; were &#x201C;helped by <persName corresp="#GA">Mr. George Allen</persName>&#x02BC;s retouching&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS4D1891"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, <date when="1891">1891</date>]</ref>, 1:vi). 
                    But what seemed comparatively to liberate reproduction of an artifact from human intervention in the <date notBefore="1890" notAfter="1899">1890s</date> now seems quaintly like handicraft. 
                    From a <date notBefore="2001" notAfter="2100">twenty&#x2010;first century</date> perspective, the early stage of &#x201C;photogravure was a hand process&#x201D;; 
                    the skill incorporated the <date notBefore="1701" notAfter="1800">eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> technique of aquatint, and &#x201C;early attempts to print photographs in ink 
                    often included efforts to retain . . . [the] capacity to manipulate the image&#x201D; through &#x201C;intrusions of handwork&#x201D;
