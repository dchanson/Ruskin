                    their first ambitious tour of the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName> occurred <date notBefore="1833-05-10" notAfter="1833-09-22">between May and September 1833</date>. 
                    The tour therefore fell only a few years after the <date notBefore="1830-07-26" notAfter="1830-07-29">July Revolution</date> in <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> 
                    and the <date notBefore="1830-08-25" notAfter="1831-07-14">Belgian Revolution of 1830</date>.
                </p>
                <p>The Ruskin traveling party included, besides <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and his parents,

                    On the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName>, they enjoyed the services of a cicerone, named <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="salvador_note.php"><persName corresp="#SALVADOR">Salvador</persName></ref>; 
                    and in <date when="1833">1833</date>, as in <date when="1825">1825</date>, the family benefited from the rapid rise of efficent and inexpensive travel to the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName> by steam. 
                    For these developments in travel across the <placeName corresp="#ENGLISHCHANNEL">English Channel</placeName>, which the Ruskins enjoyed

                    from the <placeName corresp="#TOWEROFLONDON">Tower of London</placeName>, and five days per week from <geogName corresp="#DOVERCLF">Dover</geogName>, 
                    which was where the Ruskins boarded. Traveling to <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName> in the same year as the Ruskins,

                <p>As a guide, the Ruskins for the first time employed the services of a cicerone, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="salvador_note.php"><persName corresp="#SALVADOR">Salvador</persName></ref>. 
                    They also carried guidebooks, as they did on all their tours. These texts, prior to the appearance in <date when="1836">1836</date> of

                    were undergoing a transition from the <date notBefore="1701" notAfter="1800">eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> travel narrative (often in epistolary form) 
                    to the organized manual of practical advice and digest of historical information found in the modern guidebook

                <p>A number of these transitional texts were also updated reissues of travel works that had appeared earlier in the century, particularly from when the Continent reopened following the end

                        remained an article of faith on both sides of the <geogName corresp="#ENGLISHCHANNEL">Channel</geogName>; however, British perception of <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName> was undergoing a transformation,

                        Still, <persName corresp="#FMT">Mrs. Trollope</persName> considered <persName corresp="#LGCF">Leopold</persName>&#x02BC;s position to be false, since the citizens of the new Belgian nation remained &#x201C;unresistingly shackled&#x201D; 
                        by their Catholic culture on the one hand, while &#x201C;a club or a dagger [was] put y law into the[ir] other&#x201D; hand by the new constitution: 
                        &#x201C;Nothing can present a stranger anomaly in human affairs than the sight of a nation, deeply and severely Catholic, 
                        attempting to ape the chartered libertinism of political thinking, which a few noisy and discontented persons are endeavouring to teach them. 
                        The law which authorizes unrestrained license of tongue and pen, both public and pbrivate, on all subjects, whether political or religious, 
                        accords ill with the principles of a people whose religion commands them to bring their thoughts, words, and deeds before the tribunal of their priests&#x201D;

                    <p>Neither <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> nor the Ruskins 
                        crossed the <geogName corresp="#STBERNARD">St. Bernard Pass</geogName>&#x2014;although the Ruskins ascended for a visit to the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STBERNARNDHOSPICE">Hospice</placeName> from the Swiss side&#x2014;both parties 
                        availing themselves of the <geogName corresp="#SIMPLON">Simplon Pass</geogName>, which had been modernized by <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>'s engineers

                        The point is that it didn't have a carriage road: see Bigelow, "The Alps": "The passes of the Great and the Little St. Bernard are interesting from their proximity to Mont Blanc, 
                        lying on opposite sides of it; also from their scenery and historical associations. The former is well known for the Hospice, situated near its summit, 
                        inhabited by a benevolent order of monks, whose business is to rescue and relieve distressed travellers. It may seem singular that neither of these long and well known 
                        passages, has yet been made the site of a carriage road. But the king of Sardinia has shown himself less fond of public improvements of this kind, 
                        than his more communicativeneighbors." 417-18
                        
                        For poetry about their tours, both writers turned to the St. Bernard, about which <persName corresp="#WBI">William Brockedon</persName> wrote: "no passage of the Alps . . . 
                        affords to the traveller greater pleasure, either in the enjoyment or the recollection of his journey to Italy" (or pleasurable anticipation, in the case of Rogers's speaker), 
                        "for besides the wildness of this Alpine pass, and the beauty of the valley of Aosta, . . . the kind reception which . . . [the traveler] experiences from the religious community at the hospice, 
                        is remembered as long as he can be grateful for the devotion . . . [of] these excellent men
