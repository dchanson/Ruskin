                            In the present note, precedents and problems in past approaches are summarized as a foundation for the rationale governing the editorial approach adopted in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>. 
                            Past practices include separating genres and disciplines that Ruskin, in his youth, did not necessarily perceive as divided; 
                            isolating works from larger corpuses in which Ruskin experimented with anthologizing and recontexualizing those works; and imposing editorial policies with misguided aims of suppressing texts that editors deemed incomplete, 
                            while intrusively regularizing and even substantively revising texts that did get selected for publication.</p>

                            <head type="sub-subsection">The Editorial Division of Poetry from Prose</head>
                            <p>The first editors of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early manuscripts divided the archive by genre, poetry from prose. 
                                The precedent for this division was set by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s father and his friend, 
                                <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="harrison_w_h_note.php"><persName corresp="#WHH">W. H. Harrison</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1792" notAfter="1878">1792&#x2013;1878</date>)</ref>, 
                                when they collected a selection of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early verse compositions in the anthology 
                                <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1850_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1850"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (<date when="1850">1850</date>)</title> by <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">&#x201C;J.R.&#x201D;</persName></ref> 
                                For them, the anthology commemorated <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s erstwhile vocation as a poet, an ambition that they had devotedly supported as editors and promoters, but that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself had decisively abandoned. 
                                Nearly a half&#x2010;century later than this first project, the decision to separate the poetry from the prose was maintained by 
                                <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="collingwood_w_g_note.php"><persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> (<date notBefore="1854" notAfter="1932">1854&#x2013;1932</date>)</ref> in his edition, 
                                <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (<date when="1891">1891</date>)</title></ref>. 
                                His choice arguably was driven or at least intensified by the cachet that, by the end of the century, had come to surround 
                                <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1850"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (<date when="1850">1850</date>)</title> as a scarce collector&#x02BC;s item. 
                                The heated rare&#x2010;book market surrounding the <date when="1850">1850</date> volume had already resulted in a pirated American edition of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poems&#x2014;one of several piracies that threatened <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s income from his books 
                                (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php#PROVOCATION"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (<date when="1891">1891</date>)</title>: The Provocation of American Literary Piracy</ref>). 
                                Animating all this interest in the poems was the charm of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s autobiographical narrative in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> about his youthful career as a poet manqu&#x00E9;.</p>
                            <p><persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> planned a complementary edition of prose, documenting <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s turn from poetry to criticism. 
                                This edition was never realized under <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s editorship. Ultimately, the project was hurriedly and inadequately compiled 
                                as the first volume, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE_EARLYPROSE"><hi rend="italic">Early Prose</hi></title>, of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>, 
                                under the supervision of <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="cook_e_t_note.php"><persName corresp="#ETC">E. T. Cook</persName> (<date notBefore="1857" notAfter="1919">1857&#x2013;1919</date>)</ref> and 
                                <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="wedderburn_note.php"><persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName> (<date notBefore="1854" notAfter="1931">1854&#x2013;1931</date>)</ref>. To a significant extent, that volume merely collected 
                                recent editions of early prose works that <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="allen_george_note.php"><persName corresp="#GA">George Allen</persName> (<date notBefore="1832" notAfter="1907">1832&#x2013;1907</date>)</ref> 
                                had revived, more with a view to producing handsome volumes for the collectors&#x02BC; market and thwarting sales of American piracies, 
                                than with a serious scholarly purpose (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.php">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</ref>).</p>
                            <p>While these editorial decisions were influenced by the market, the editions did not entirely lack scholarly merit, 
                                but their bibliographical underpinnings were flawed by the foundational decision to segregate poetry from prose. 
                                <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>, who had access to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s study in his home, <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName>, 
                                was the first to undertake a descriptive and analytic bibliography of the early verse <hi rend="italic">manuscripts</hi> (earlier 
                                bibliographers had described only the youthful <hi rend="italic">publications</hi>) and he published his findings as the 
                                <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D;</title>, 
                                appended to volume 1 of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (<date when="1891">1891</date>)</title> 
                                (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS4D1891"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, <date when="1891">1891</date>]</title></ref>,1:261&#x2013;67;
                                <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS8D1891"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS8D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [8<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, <date when="1891">1891</date>]</title></ref>, 1:262&#x2013;68). 
                                Whatever bibliographical attention <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> may have given to the prose manuscripts in his preparations, 
                                the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note&#x201D;</title> was rendered incomplete and lacking in evidence, 
                                owing to arbitrarily omitting entire manuscripts that contain solely prose. Even on its own terms as a bibliography of the poetry manuscripts,

                                so far as it went, but failing to question the fundamental logic or serviceability of separating the poetry manuscripts from the prose in the first place

                            <p>As <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> organized the manuscripts that they found at <placeName corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName> 
                                during preparation of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>, their curatorship of the early manuscripts was based on the same arbitrary distinction. 
                                They separately bound some that contained texts of early prose exclusively, while gathering stray poems (including, inconsistently, some early prose) 
                                in <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title></ref>. They relegated description of the prose manuscripts 
                                (or some of them) to volume 38, the <title type="book" corresp="JRWORKSLE_BIBLIOGRAPHY"><hi rend="italic">Bibliography</hi></title> volume 
                                of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>, classifying these descriptions as &#x201C;Juvenilia&#x201D;&#x2014;leaving open the question 
                                of what should be comprised under that term, if not also the early poetry manuscripts listed separately in the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note&#x201D;</title>. 
                                Thus, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s editorial scheme&#x2014;which, if flawed in its logic, had at least beeen carried out consistently and reasonably accurately&#x2014;was now also 
                                confused by inconsistency and unevenness of bibliographical description and editorial procedure in the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>.</p><!-- DCH, intros to these volumes -->
                        <!--<p>In its bibliographical underpinnings, <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> opposes this separation, first by situating verse in dynamics of family writing, the letters.
                            Emerson argued for overcoming the distinction between invention and prose. What remained unexamined and concealed by separating a descriptive/analytic bibliography 
                            of the &#x201C;manuscripts&#x201D; from the lists of works was questioning what constitutes a &#x201C;work&#x201D; and the relation of a work to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s evident interest in print culture.
                           The idea of a work had been influenced, moreover, by <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s decision to supporess &#x201C;incomplete&#x201D; works and to impart polish and completion to what he did publish.
                            The phenomenon of fragmentariness I partly addressed in terms of psychological explanation; but this approach persisted in separating off these texts, 
                            and as <persName corresp="#RBRETON">Breton</persName> pointed out, neglected its complement in the formalism of other works. The problem of what a work is remains obscure because separated from materiality.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s decision to divide the editorial task by genre, while arguably misguided in itself, 
                            and further compromised by <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s inconsistencies, 
                            is nonetheless significant for reflecting historical conditions of reception. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in his late autobiographical writing 
                            encouraged readers to conceptualize his career as divided between an early misdirected ambition to become a poet 
                            and a discovery of his true vocation as a prose writer. Moreover, according to autobiographical accounts in <title type="book" corresp="#JRFORS"><hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi></title> 
                            and <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, the prose that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intended as representative of his vocation 
                            was not the poetic prose of his youth, but the allegedly more analytical and plain prose of later years. This account of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            genres is faithfully reflected in fin&#x2010;de&#x2010;si&#x00E8;cle biographical and editorial projects, even 
                            at the cost of distorting facts, such as <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s insistence that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            started his professional writing life by publishing scientific prose prior to publishing poetry, 
                            although <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> definitely knew the opposite to be the truth (see 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="on_skiddaw_and_derwentwater_apparatus.php#COMPPUB"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D;</title>: Composition and Publication</ref>).DCH: Emerson</p> -->
                            <p>In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, rather than perpetuating the late nineteenth&#x2010;century conceptualization of the early manuscripts in terms of a vocational watershed between poetry and prose, 
                                our ambition is to organize the archive around a creatively dynamic tension perceivable throughout the early writing&#x2014;a tension, less between poetry and prose 
                                than between a unitary work, whether in verse or prose, and its potential to join and alter a larger anthology or collection, 
                                and also a dynamism between traditional genres and their potential to join with others to form a composite. 
                                In the manuscripts of the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> known to the Ruskin family as the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref>, 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> projected his prose compositions as &#x201C;volumes&#x201D; of <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy Concluded&#x201D;</title>, 
                                intended as an ongoing multi&#x2010;volume series, while filling out each of these &#x201C;volumes&#x201D; 
                                with poems collected into small anthologies. Later, he advanced beyond volumes that compiled multiple genres to design unitary works 
                                as multi&#x2010;genre anthologies in themselves, as in the <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php">Account of a Tour on the Continent</ref> 
                                (<date notBefore="1833" notAfter="1834">1833&#x2013;34</date>)&#x2014;a work initially composed as a travelogue solely in verse, 
                                and then re&#x2010;conceived as a composite&#x2010;genre travelogue in verse, prose, and picture. 
                                Thus, in his youth, while <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> learned to observe conventional generic boundaries in many of his poetic, scientific, and theological manuscripts, 
                                he was also constantly intrigued by their dynamic interrelatedness. To represent this dynamism of container and contained, 
                                we exploit the &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; element of the <orgName corresp="#TEI">Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)</orgName> markup, 
                                which can describe <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s nested structures, albeit somewhat imperfectly 
                                (see <ref type="internal" target="#TEICORPUS">&#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; Markup and the Tension between Works and Corpora</ref>).</p> 
                            <!--Our ambition is to design an archive that may assist the community of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> scholars, 
                            in the spirit of <persName corresp="#JJM">Jerome McGann</persName>&#x02BC;s urging in (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MCGANNRADIANT"><title type="book" corresp="#MCGANNRADIANT"><hi rend="italic">Radiant Textuality</hi></title></ref>, 
                            to pose questions about the dynamism of the early writing that we do not know to ask&#x2014;or at least to bring to light what we already know about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s dynamic writing, 
                            but are not aware of in the early works (p. 83). At the same time, we are conscious that these tensions are muted by the organization of the archive into Work Pages and Manuscript Pages, 
                            thus surrounding individual works with formidable and isolating walls of editorial commentary. As a &#x201C;knowledge site&#x201D; in <persName corresp="#PLS">Peter Shillingsburg</persName>&#x02BC;s terms, 
                            <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> tends to be weighty in knowledge, but not very agile in responding to unanticipated inquiries by users, which <persName corresp="#PLS">Shillingsburg</persName>, like <persName corresp="#JJM">Jerome McGann</persName>, believes these sites should accommodate above all

                            <p>Chronologically, a starting point for the scope of works edited in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> would appear easily determined

                                of a <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> archive is suggested by the decisions of <persName corresp="#HGV">Helen Gill Viljoen</persName>, 
                                whose interest in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early writings drove her farther back in time to his 
                                &#x201C;Scottish heritage&#x201D; in order to understand <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s parents. The personalities and influence of

                                believed, were foundational to an understanding of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> as a writer 
                                (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SCOTTISHHERITAGE"><persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTISHHERITAGE"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin&#x02BC;s Scottish Heritage</hi></title></ref>). 
                                Similarly, <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title> 
                                begins with the courtship correspondence between <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s parents, along with their exchanges with their parents. 
                                While the present editor is entirely sympathetic to researching <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s juvenilia in context of his parents&#x02BC; writing 
                                (see, e.g., <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HANSONMATERIALITY"><persName corresp="#DCH">Hanson</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HANSONMATERIALITY">&#x201C;Materiality in John Ruskin&#x02BC;s Early Letters and Dialogues&#x201D;</title></ref>),

                                The scope of the contents of <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> should advance an understanding of how this is so&#x2014;how the manuscript corpus

                                Paradoxically, in the case of juvenilia, attempts to define and circumscribe the scope of a body of early writing can undermine the perceived value of the editorial project. 
                                As <persName corresp="#CAA">Alexander</persName> and <persName corresp="#JMCM">McMaster</persName> comment, 
                                establishing an end&#x2010;point of an author&#x02BC;s &#x201C;apprentice&#x201D; work tends to reflect backward 
                                on the early writing in negative terms, owing to pejorative connotations of the terms used to characterize 
                                the writing, including the term <hi rend="italic">juvenilia</hi> itself. For example, the separation between the <orgName corresp="#BRONTES">Bront&#x00EB; sisters&#x02BC;</orgName> early writing and the novels has often been approached 
                                as a &#x201C;problem&#x201D; in a derogatory sense, with the <hi rend="italic">juvenile</hi> understood to persist as a kind of lingering debilitation

                                has traced child writing as a literary historical phenomenon from the eighteenth through the early nineteenth centuries. 
                                Although <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date> writers may seem themselves to have sanctioned a moralistic and negative assessment of their early writing, characterizing their transition away from juvenilia as a righteous rite of passage, 
                                <persName corresp="#KEB">Kate E.

                                thought about her transition from <hi rend="italic">juvenilia</hi> to the novel, <title type="book" corresp="#BRONTEPROFESSOR"><hi rend="italic">The Professor</hi></title> 
                                (composed ca. <date notBefore="1844" notAfter="1846">1844&#x2013;46</date>; published <date when="1857">1857</date>). By characterizing this novel in its preface as a &#x201c;little book&#x201d;, 
                                <persName corresp="#CBW">Bront&#x00EB;</persName> emphasized its material form (she contended for a single&#x2010;volume publication, contrary to publishers&#x02bc; three&#x2010;volume standard). 
                                By dwelling on the novel&#x02bc;s smallness, <persName corresp="#CBW">Bront&#x00EB;</persName>&#x02bc;s preface works to connect <title type="book" corresp="#BRONTEPROFESSOR"><hi rend="italic">The Professor</hi></title> with the juvenilia&#x2014;distinctively,

                                At the same time, <persName corresp="#CBW">Bront&#x00EB;</persName> falls into the defensive reflex of denigrating the value of the juvenilia, by erasing its existence as quickly as she invokes it,

                            <p>Going forward, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> perhaps remained permanently at war with himself whether the strident demands of social duty would prevail 
                                in repudiating a boyhood identity, which he increasingly identified with landscape feeling as a phase of history to be critiqued, 
                                or whether the pull of memory would would lead him back to a more ambivalent disavowal mixed with regret, which he expressed in hypnotic autobiographical treatments of childhood. 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> shared this struggle between repudiation and disavowal with mid&#x2010;Victorian poets who rejected the dialogue of the mind with itself in favor of communal effort, 
                                only to seek ways to preserve the self they disavowed&#x2014;from <persName corresp="#ALT">Tennyson</persName>&#x02bc;s union with a mystically embodied <persName corresp="#AH">Arthur Hallam</persName>,

                                Often these ambivalent quests are accompanied by a reassessment of <persName corresp="#WW">Wordsworth</persName>&#x02bc;s paradigm of the child of nature, which in 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s case led to a particularly fraught series of reappraisals of the poet

                                Perhaps it is in these genre&#x2010;forming Victorian quests (and Romantic genre de&#x2010;forming) that juvenilia could take shape as &#x201c;almost a genre&#x201d; reflexively, particularly in the material instantiation of juvenilia as a thing to be disavowed, 
                                but the major male Victorian poets were aggressively reactionary in repudiating attempts by others to re&#x2010;embody their juvenilia in print. 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, by comparison, was willing to risk a charge of unmanliness by making public a re&#x2010;embodying of his juvenilia in facsimile

                            <p>A more decisive act of disavowal is evident in the reaction by <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> to his son&#x02bc;s abandonment of poetry.

                                Similarly, from the <date notBefore="1860" notAfter="1899">1860s through the 1890s</date>, beliefs about what constituted a national <hi rend="italic">literature</hi>,

                                were motivated by class snobbery against faddish enthusiasts and speculators who invaded rare book showrooms and caused prices for such &#x201C;minor&#x201D; works 
                                as juvenilia to balloon at the expense of valuing modern classics.</p>
                            <p>Some of the most intensely emotional resistance to editing juvenilia has issued from the authors themselves. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, 
                                a debate formed around the fin de si&#x00E8;cle practice of collecting the juvenilia of &#x201C;modern&#x201D; 
                                (i.e., <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date>) authors, a practice that arose from the phenomenon 
                                of compiling collections of modern authors that aimed at comprehensiveness, including the acquisition of every &#x201C;minor&#x201D; publication such as juvenilia. 
                                The debate, which challenged the significance of what were deemed &#x201C;minor&#x201D; publications and deplored the effect of these items on the rare book market, 
                                spilled over into scholarly arguments about appropriate bibliographical approaches to these writers&#x02BC; canons. Much rancor arose over a perceived threat 
                                posed by this collecting, especially of juvenilia, to established literary authority and the control exercised over a literary corpus by an author or by the author&#x02BC;s family. 
                                Authors objected to the &#x201C;resurrection&#x201D; of their juvenile works by editors and bibliographers&#x2014;the term <hi rend="italic">resurrection</hi>

                            <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collecting held a singular position in this debate, for whereas many authors expressed embarrassment 
                                about their literary juvenilia, and reacted angrily to collectors seeking out early publications, and even prosecuted publishers and editors 
                                who supported this collecting fashion, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appeared to sanction this curiosity. As he wrote in

                                since &#x201C;the weak little rhyme already&#x201D; demonstrated &#x201C;all that I ever could be, and all that I cannot be&#x201D;

                                as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> surely knew; and like other writers, he reacted with skepticism when listings of his earliest published writing

                                whereas <persName corresp="#ALT">Alfred Tennyson</persName> and <persName corresp="#RB">Robert Browning</persName> abused such collectors&#x02BC; publications 
                                and hounded the editors and publishers who reprinted their early writings by threatening criminal prosecution for piracy, 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> trumped the excavations of &#x201C;resurrection men&#x201D; by hastening to reprint his own fugitive pieces, charging the editorial task to young men in his inner circle, 
                                such as <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName>.</p>
                            <p>Despite <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s atypical openness in exposing his early writing, one can question the value of indulging his conceit. 
                                One argument in favor of the early writing is the significance that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself bestowed on it. 
                                The poem <ref type="apparatus" target="glenfarg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glenfarg&#x201D;</title></ref> 
                                may or may not be a &#x201C;weak little rhyme&#x201D; in itself, but the capacity of these writings is well established as having stirred &#x201C;dark waters&#x201D; as well as bright 
                                when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> reviewed his juvenilia in preparation for writing his autobiography, <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, 
                                (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HANSONDARKWATERS">Hanson, &#x201C;The Dark Waters of <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi>&#x201D;</ref>). Moreover, 
                                the policies of other authors and editors to banish juvenilia can carry an agenda that proves 
                                at least as interesting historically as the allegedly minor writing that such policies disqualify for serious study. 
                                <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> believed that the scope of materials included in the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> 
                                was determined by the guarded decorum of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s inner circle&#x2014;a policy, namely, 
                                that &#x201C;nothing should be made public which might reflect adversely, from [the editors&#x02BC;] point of view, 
                                either upon <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> or upon any member of the family&#x201D;; and also (and potentially contradictorily) that 
                                &#x201C;all that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> said autobiographically, especially in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, 
                                about his life and that of his parents should be given unqualified editorial support&#x201D;

                                limited his edition of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early poems,

                                to &#x201C;completed&#x201D; works&#x2014;a limitation imposed possibly by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself; or by his caretakers, 
                                the Severns; or by his literary executors. Whatever the motivation, one effect of the ban on fragments was to suppress <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s expressions 
                                of anger and frustration over parental attempts to rein in his writing&#x2014;evidence of youthful psychological disturbance that the elderly

                            <p>For young Victorians, in particular, a rite of passage may have seemed culturally mandated, demanding a rejection of youthful writing, 
                                regardless of how messily a self&#x2010;transformation conformed with one's outward declarations of change.
                                One can accept that a Carlylean break with Byronic romance was almost inevitable for promising young writers of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>, 
                                without necessarily agreeing with <persName corresp="#KC">Karen Chase</persName> that <persName corresp="#CBW">Charlotte</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#PBB">Branwell</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                                early Byronism presented only &#x201C;eros without psyche&#x201D;, in which &#x201C;no Bildung&#x201D; could occur, and that therefore the characters&#x02BC; 
                                &#x201C;personalties [in the early tales] do not develop; they merely intensify&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CHASEEROSANDPSYCHE"><persName corresp="#KC">Chase</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#CHASEEROSANDPSYCHE"><hi rend="italic">Eros and Psyche</hi></title></ref>, 15, 14). 
                                In nineteenth&#x2010;century juvenilia, the genre of the <hi rend="italic">farewell</hi>, as a self&#x2010;conscious parting of ways with the writing of one&#x02BC;s youth, 
                                must have seemed compulsory. This rite of passage 
                                is epitomized by <persName corresp="#CBW">Charlotte Bront&#x00EB;</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="essay" corresp="#BRONTEFAREWELL">&#x201C;Farewell to Angria&#x201D;</title> (ca. <date when="1839">1839</date>), 
                                in which <persName corresp="#CBW">Bront&#x00EB;</persName> takes leave fondly and reluctantly, but with some relief, of her fictional world of <placeName type="fictional" corresp="#BRONTEANGRIA">Angria</placeName>, 
                                which she represents in this essay as a gallery of landscapes and portraits in varying seasons and moods

                                Bront&#x00EB; was relinquishing her Byronism at a high pitch of intensity in her engagement with this poetic trend

                                that perhaps makes this piece a rarity as a genre, as compared with a more gradual detachment manifested by other writers.

                                but much of his poetic Byronism took the form, not of erotic tales and personae, but of landscape imagery, as if in realization of <persName corresp="#CBW">Charlotte</persName>&#x02BC;s metaphor 
                                place as landscapes and portraits suffused with Byronism in <title type="essay" corresp="#BRONTEFAREWELL">&#x201C;Farewell to Angria&#x201D;</title>. <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> 
                                contains several such fragmentary imitations of sublime landscapes that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> populates with &#x201C;spirits&#x201D; drawn from <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                                <title type="drama" corresp="#BYRONMANFRED"><hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi></title> as well as from <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s poems and tales, 
                                fragments in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s purpose was perhaps merely redundantly to intensify an effect. In making available all of these previously 
                                unpublished fragments, the benefit of <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>&#x02BC;s comprehensiveness prove only to demonstrate a boyish compulsion. If so, it is against these 
                                repetitious gothic landscape tropes that one may search for signs of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s break with Byronism&#x2014;a change typically

                                ideas of a writer&#x02BC;s or artist&#x02BC;s emergence need to be historically defined and situated, as <persName corresp="#CBOCK">Carol Bock</persName>

                            began to sway literary scholars toward a more sociological approach focused on study of the textual artifact in its cultural moment. 
                            Historians came meanwhile to recognize that, in their allegedly purist views of documentary editing, they had tended to overlook their own interventionist and &#x201C;literary&#x201D; practices

                            The study of juvenilia foregrounds the merits that historians have traditionally claimed 
                            for diplomatic editing of manuscript documents while also highlighting the difficulties of achieving purity in a diplomatic method.</p>
                        <p>Even before the advent of sociological approaches to literary editing, twentieth&#x2010;century editing of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            swung to a documentary method, prompted in part by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="viljoen_h_g_note.php"><persName corresp="#HGV">Helen Gill Viljoen</persName></ref>&#x02BC;s scorn for the inconsistencies and haphazard methods

                            <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> was less willing to point out similar faults in <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s practices, whereas arguably the

                            given <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s policy of printing unpublished materials, albeit selectively and in heavily edited versions. In any case, a diplomatic approach to transcribing 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts became the norm with the editorial labors of <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName>.

                            <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> also attempted faithfully to reproduce the idiosyncrasies of the Ruskins&#x02BC; punctuation, 
                            recognizing how the pulse of thought can be revealed in the hand. The reader is treated as a confidante, comprehending the fullness of the family conversation, 
                            and brought closer to the young <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s responsive thought and feeling. As <persName corresp="#SE">Sheila Emerson</persName> observes, 
                            the frequent lack of punctuation in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early writing provides reflects how he 
                            &#x201C;bound his phrases each to each&#x201D; and allowed &#x201C;their movement [to jam] back and forth in the mind&#x201D;

                        <p>In the evolution of <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>&#x02BC;s justification of a diplomatic approach to manuscript transcription&#x2014;first appealing to re&#x2010;creation of an intimacy with a writer, and later arguing for a historical rationale&#x2014;his 
                            editions reflect a longer trend in manuscript and book collecting. 
                            Late&#x2010;Victorian collectors sought first editions by &#x201C;modern&#x201D; (i.e., nineteenth&#x2010;century) writers in the belief that the physical book produced closest in time to the author&#x02BC;s composition 
                            carried a personal connection with a writer. In manuals on book collecting, this &#x201C;sentiment&#x201D; borne by first editions was figuratively expressed, as it later was by <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> in his most enthusiastic writing, as if following 
                            the author&#x02BC;s hand on his writing table. Subsequently, the New Bibliographers of the <date notBefore="1930" notAfter="1939">1930s</date> rejected 
                            such sentiment in favor of more &#x201C;objective&#x201D; approaches 
                            (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.php">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</ref>; 
                            and <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HANSONSENTIMENTANDMATERIALITY">Hanson, &#x201C;Sentiment and Materiality in Late&#x2010;Victorian Book Collecting&#x201D;</ref>). 
                            In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> studies, a sentiment of intimacy with the author through collecting or manuscript study seems to have persisted longer, 
                            perhaps because <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself sought such immediacy of connection with audiences by commenting on the materiality of writing, 
                            whether as dramatized in <title type="book" corresp="#JRFORS"><hi rend="italic">Fors Claivigera</hi></title> as the act of writing thwarted by piercing steam whistles, 
                            or as represented in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> by a facsimile of his boyhood writing for whatever it might reveal about his youth. 
                            Added to this encouragement by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in his published work to think about his writing as a physical act was the historical accident 
                            of manuscripts remaining at <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName> for discovery by <persName corresp="#HGV">Helen Gill Viljoen</persName> 
                            prior to their dispersal in the estate sales&#x2014;an experience that made her suspect of any form of editorial intervention that might operate as a conspiracy 
                            against <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s ideas. Likewise <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>,

                            jumps quickly from the record of past editors&#x02BC; attempts to regularize <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s punctuation and grammar 
                            to an accusation that what past editors truly sought was to suppress (quoting <persName corresp="#CEN">Charles Eliot Norton</persName>)

                        <p>In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, which is able to present electronic facsimiles alongside diplomatic transcriptions of the text, 
                            the claim is not to bring the reader even closer to the moment of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s production of manuscripts at his writing table. 
                            Since the era of the New Bibliographers, the widening access to manuscripts via ever more spectacularly vivid digitization has brought only renewed skepticism 
                            about creating the illusion of reproducing the real thing. In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, our aim is neither to accuse manuscript studies or first&#x2010;edition collecting of &#x201C;sentimentality&#x201D; nor to defend the &#x201C;aura&#x201D; of objects; 
                            rather, in annotation and markup of transcriptions taken from original materials in almost all cases, 
                            and in exhibition of these transcriptions alongside digital facsimiles where possible, our aim is to realize a model that, 
                            as <persName corresp="#EPIERAZZO">Elena Pierazzo</persName> urges, proves &#x201C;useful when it is used for the purpose for which it is built&#x201d;

                            That purpose, among other things, is to facilitate study of how, on the one hand, the Ruskin family <hi rend="italic">believed</hi> <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;hopes and feelings&#x201D; 
                            to be inscribed in his physical strokes on paper as well as through his text; and of how, on the other hand, 
                            he often meant his punctuation, many orthographic styles, and other aspects of presentation to reflect, less his inner world, than the print and pictorial culture surrounding him, in an era as visually stimulating as our own.</p>

                            Like many nineteenth&#x2010;century young authors, he modeled his textual production on published texts. In the earliest extant extended prose work of juvenilia, &#x201C;Volume I&#x201D; of his

                        <p>Pursuing his physical imitation to small typographical features, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> invented marks 
                            that present the digital encoder with odd challenges in markup. For example, in order to fully justify his hand&#x2010;printed text on the right as well as left margins, as in a printed book, 
                            he invented an end&#x2010;of&#x2010;line mark that resembles a hyphen, but that varies in length according to what he needed to fill out the measure of a line, 
                            where words fell short of the right&#x2010;justified margin. (<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> continued employing this end&#x2010;of&#x2010;line mark as late as <date notBefore="1834" notAfter="1835">1834&#x2013;35</date> 
                            in his most elaborate and sophisticated imitation of the print culture of illustrated travel literature, the <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX fair copy</ref> of his

To encode this mark as a hyphen would be misleading (particularly since he also used hyphens at the ends of some lines to divide syllables across the break), 
                            whereas to ignore the mark altogether would be implicitly to assert that the materiality 
                            of text has no bearing on how we study and think about the youthful productions of nineteenth&#x2010;century authors. In this instance, <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> 
                            uses the <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> glyph element, &#x3008;g&#x3009;, assigning it the &#x0040;type &#x201C;justification&#x201D;. This is an interpretation, 
                            not a neutrally objective encoding of horizontal strokes occurring at the ends of lines, but documentary editing that is innocent of editorial interpretation is neither possible nor desirable, 
                            if the purpose is to understand how Ruskin both appropriated the appearance of print and constrained his invention to obey its rules (see

                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early manuscripts are already interpretations, in presenting themselves as &#x201C;printed&#x201D; works. In cases of punctuation marks too enigmatic 
                            to interpret, the recurring pattern is assigned markup and annotated with a provisional explanation, but no definitive interpretation is imposed. Also, no characters or punctuation marks are ignored that can reasonably be inferred as intentional. 
                            Even if we must temporize about how to interpret and encode what we see, we avoid the inefficiency of passing over puzzling transcription to be captured later 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#TRANSCRIPTION">Transcription and Encoding Procedures</ref>).</p>

                            which takes into account the conditions of authorship that developed during the <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date> &#x201C;age of printing&#x201D;. 
                            Professional authors in the nineteenth century came to realize &#x201C;that their final manuscripts were way stations on the road to a perfected text, rather than the thing itself&#x201D;; 
                            accordingly, &#x201C;the manuscript no longer carried the same textual authority that it once had, even when it represented the author&#x02BC;s final involvement in such matters as the orthography and punctuation 
                            of most of the text&#x201D;. Authors in the age of print sent &#x201C;their work to press . . . anticipating&#x2014;and in many cases hoping&#x2014;that changes in the text 
                            or its presentation [would] be introduced by the printers or the publishers&#x201D;. Not so, manuscript &#x201C;poems or other compositions that were intended for the perusal

                            fair&#x2010;copied for limited distribution, but did not intend for publication. These kinds of artifacts, which include nineteenth&#x2010;century juvenilia, 
                            bear authority comparable to that of scribal copies of pre&#x2010;modern manuscripts, which &#x201C;the writer never expected . . . to be superseded 
                            by a more authoritative printed text. Such a manuscript had to be more carefully prepared than a press copy, because it would neither be vetted by publisher&#x02BC;s

                            The materiality&#x2014;the polish&#x2014;of nineteenth&#x2010;century juvenilia is as significant as the rhetorical and textual relation between author and a private or confidential audience,

                            the serious play of appropriating this material world of print prevented the writer from &#x201C;simply being colonized by the teaching adult&#x201D;, 
                            and instead enabled the writer and maker to &#x201C;coloniz[e] the adult world itself by remaking it in the image of the self; and it is by this process

                        <p>To understand how the nineteenth&#x2010;century child writer embodies the self in the materiality of the polished confidential manuscript, 
                            the markup routine should so far as possible capture physical as well as textual features. As remarked in 
                            <ref type="internal" target="#MATERIALITY">Expressing the Materiality of the Manuscripts</ref>, this routine necessarily involves the encoder 
                            in interpreting and not just mechanically capturing such marks, if only to be able to classify marks of which the purpose may not as yet be entirely understood 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#TRANSCRIPTION">Transcription and Encoding Procedures</ref>). Moreover, the scope of the archive must comprise 
                            the entirety of known manuscripts, even when multiple copies of a text present few substantive variants, since the various draft and fair copies may represent varying

                            manuscripts as compared with public? First, the class of manuscripts that derive authority from both their polished presentation and their confidential status 
                            suggests that readers perceived authority in the material artifact itself, which bore direct witness to the authority of the writer&#x2014;or 
                            of something about the writer. &#x201C;I let <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>s letters come just as he writes them&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> explained to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> when enclosing their son&#x02BC;s letters inside her own,
                            &#x201C;that you may not be misled in your judgment as to his hopes and feelings&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="apparatus" target="mr_to_jjr_1829-03-04_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="mr_to_jjr_1829-03-04">letter of <date when="1829-03-04">4 March 1829</date></title></ref>, in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title>, ed. <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName></ref>, 1:185]).
                            <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> assumes a Romantic idea about writing as an open window to the writer&#x02BC;s expression, which if copied in her own hand 
                            would not only lose authority, but even potentially mislead the reader. 
                            There do survive manuscript copies of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s works in his parents&#x02BC; and others&#x02BC; hands, but these are far less common than <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own fair copies; 
                            and it seems unlikely that what <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> wanted the Grays to &#x201C;see&#x201D;&#x2014;not just read&#x2014;would have been a fair copy in her own hand, 
                            which derived authority from her adult sophistication of punctuation, spelling, orthography, and the like. 
                            Rather, &#x201C;judgment as to [the child writer&#x02BC;s] hopes and feelings&#x201D; derived from an intimate experience and knowledge that were available 
                            only through the authoritative original artifact; and by virtue of the artifact&#x02BC;s materiality, 
                            this experience could be extended to a trusted confidential circle.</p>
                        <p>Evidence suggests that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> shared this sense of an intended confidential audience that, in <persName corresp="#DHR">Reiman</persName>&#x02BC;s defintion, 
                            was most likely &#x201C;personally known to or interested in the author&#x201D;.  
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s understanding of these conditions is indicated by his inclusion of a letter to the Grays&#x02BC; relation, 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="monro_robert_mrs_note.php"><persName corresp="#MONROROBERTMRS">Mrs. Robert Monro</persName></ref>, 
                            as part of <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title></ref>, a manuscript that he entitled &#x201C;vol 1&#x201D; of his &#x201C;Works&#x201D;.
                            By including a letter to <persName corresp="#MONROROBERTMRS">Mrs. Monro</persName> as part of the handsewn pamphlet, which consists otherwise entirely of poems, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears implicitly to invite <persName corresp="#MONROROBERTMRS">Mrs. Monro</persName> to form part his confidential audience beyond the immediate family circle. 
                            The designation &#x201C;Works&#x201D;, moreover, attests to the significance of this production, both as a physical thing, a &#x201C;volume&#x201D;,
                            and as an abstract promise of more to come.</p>
                        <p>It follows that, as an editorial procedure appropriate to a manuscript&#x02BC;s classification as a polished confidential production, 
                            an edition of <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date> juvenilia should include manuscript images, as does <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>; 
                            diplomatic, and not eclectic or otherwise &#x201C;corrected&#x201D; transcriptions of texts; 
                            and a thorough physical description of the manuscript. In <hi rend="italic">fin de si&#x00E8;cle</hi> editions of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early poems and prose, 
                            some interest in the physical manuscripts was attested by facsimiles of selected manuscript pages, 
                            although the basis of selection was rarely made evident, and the sparseness of such examples, which was doubtless legislated in part by cost, was probably limited also by 
                            a perception that such images satisfied curiosity rather than providing essential scholarly information. Manuscript facsimiles in these editions, 
                            like reproductions of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s drawings, were printed on heavier paper stock and bound only into the large&#x2010;paper, 
                            quarto collector&#x02BC;s edition of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)</title></ref>, 
                            and not in the inexpensive octavo editions. In the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title></ref>, 
                            manuscript facsimiles seem to gain scholarly purpose, but in fact the manuscripts selected for reproduction tend to be as random and lacking in context 
                            as those in <persName corresp="#GA">George Allen</persName>&#x02BC;s collector&#x02BC;s editions of the youthful writing, which he published in the <date notBefore="1890" notAfter="1899">1890s</date>. 
                            The early editors did supply descriptive bibliographies of the manuscripts, but the descriptions were limited in detail; and as argued above in 
                            <ref type="internal" target="#DEFINING">Defining <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Manuscripts</hi></ref>, lost even more coherence and consistency 
                            in the transition from <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (<date when="1891">1891</date>)</title> to the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>.</p>
                        <p>While there was a perception among late&#x2010;Victorian editors, then, that the confidentiality of early writing needed to be represented through its artifactual status&#x2014;allowing 
                            a child&#x02BC;s manuscripts to &#x201C;come just as he writes them&#x201D;, as <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> suggested, in order that the reader may form a
                            &#x201C;judgment as to [the child&#x02BC;s] hopes and feelings&#x201D;&#x2014;editors apparently believed that they met such a need by supplying a few facsimiles 
                            in &#x201C;large&#x2010;paper&#x201D; editions as curiosities for specialized collectors. Once the readership was widened beyond collectors to include the anonymous, 
                            public consumption of a &#x201C;common&#x201D; edition, such curiosities were dropped, while the editor&#x02BC;s duty remained only (in both common and collectors&#x02BC; editions) to 
                            intervene heavily in the texts in order to &#x201C;improve&#x201D; them according to a public standard of uniform punctuation and formal decorum. 
                            As <persName corresp="#CAA">Christine Alexander</persName> comments, in late&#x2010;Victorian editions 
                            of nineteenth&#x2010;century authors&#x02BC; juvenilia, heavy&#x2010;handed &#x201C;improvement&#x201D; of texts was typical of editorial approaches 
                            to what were condescendingly termed an author&#x02BC;s juvenile &#x201C;effusions&#x201D;.
                            <persName corresp="#CAA">Alexander</persName> contends that these &#x201C;poorly transcribed, bowdlerized and &#x2018;improved&#x2019;&#x201D; texts 
                            wholely &#x201C;reinforce the attitude of inferiority towards early works and show the kind of 
                            disrespect for childhood that was common well into the twentieth century&#x201D;&#x2014;perhaps a somewhat overstated claim, given that
                            this attitude was tempered by editors&#x02BC; acknowledgement of the special artifactual status that juvenile manuscripts held for their original, confidential readership 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ALEXANDERDEFINING"><persName corresp="#CAA">Alexander</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#ALEXANDERDEFINING">&#x201C;Defining and Representing Literary Juvenilia&#x201D;</title></ref>, 84, and see 81&#x2013;84). 
                            Nonetheless this materiality retained its value primarily among collectors and did not affect the the editor&#x02BC;s mission to &#x201c;improve&#x201D; the texts for a modern, anonymous audience.</p><!--
                        <p>In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> studies, thinking about distinctions between the private, confidential, and public in his manuscripts 
                            is complicated by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s invitation to view his writing as a window to his whole mind, an invitation rendered 
                            paradoxical by his simultaneous insistence on the Carlylean &#x201C;strength&#x201D; required to resist the pathetic fallacy. 
                            Famously, in <title corresp="#JRFORS"><hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi></title>, his open letters to &#x201C;workers&#x201D;,
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> declared that his private letters could be read aloud from the housetops, &#x201C;I never wrote a letter in my life 
                            which all the world are not welcome to read, if they will&#x201D; (letter 59); or, as he expressed the idea more colorfully to the artist, 
                            <persName corresp="JSARTIST">James Smetham</persName> (<date notBefore="1821" notAfter="1889">1821&#x2013;89</date>), &#x201C;I never wrote a private letter to any human being
                            which I would not let a bill&#x2010;sticker chalk up six feet high on <placeName corresp="#HYDEPARK">Hyde Park</placeName> wall, 
                            and stand myself in <placeName corresp="#PICCADILLY">Piccadilly</placeName> and say &#x2018;I said it&#x2019;&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 28:449, 14:462).
                            Looking to the juvenilia for the origins of this position, one wonders if this reckless intimacy was born of necessity, 
                            since <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> carried samples of <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s letters on 
                            his travels, perhaps ready to show them to any interested stranger. We can only speculate about such causes, but the result seems to have been a collapsing 
                            of private, confidential, and public into a single category, whether in his youthful or mature writing. The difference between the juvenilia and mature writing is that, 
                            whereas one can usefully parse the mature writing in terms of <persName corresp="#DHR">Reiman</persName>&#x02BC;s distinctions based on authorial intentions about audience,
                            and yet trace a commonality of autobiographical impulse connecting these differing kinds of works, the whole span of youthful writing seems almost indistinguishable 
                            in terms of authorial intention about <hi rend="italic">audience</hi>, while an autobiographical register is typically (albeit not universally, in all works) 
                            submerged below the level of detectable intention. In the manuscripts of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s mature writing, 
                            readers tend to look for private emotion universally, even when these manuscripts can be logically and usefully 
                            sorted as private, confidential, and public; in the early writing, readers are presented with a wide range of theatrical, performative emotion, 
                            but private emotion is much less easily detectable as an intention and must be read by the other means that <persName corresp="#DHR">Reiman</persName> 
                            believes to be misleading for distinguishing the public or confidential from the public&#x2014;the rhetoric of the work, and the depth of the writer&#x02BC;s relation to the person addressed.</p>
                        <p>As <persName corresp="#RBRETON">Rob Breton</persName> remarks, much of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;early verse is notable for its emotional distance and detachment, 
                            despite the intimate, spontaneous, garrulous personae of the poet and the clear imitation of and inspiration from Romantic writing&#x201D;&#x2014;a quality 
                            of detachment consistent with <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s later theory of the pathetic fallacy. If in its &#x201C;refusal of emotion&#x201D; 
                            the early writing nonetheless points also to suppression of &#x201C;pychological burdens&#x201D;,
                            then the writing often points to those burdens only in terms of their having been &#x201C;duly evaded&#x201D;.
                            Yet <persName corresp="#RBRETON">Breton</persName> also observes that the detached quality of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            early writing &#x201C;complements&#x201D; an investigation into an opposite tendency in the youthful writing&#x2014;namely, 
                            the existence of private &#x201C;signs of &#x2018;psychological disturbance&#x2019;&#x201D; 
                            that, according to <persName corresp="#DCH">David Hanson</persName>&#x02BC;s reading, were &#x201C;likely caused by his mother&#x02BC;s disapproval of her son&#x02BC;s &#x2018;romantic&#x2019; instincts and devotion to poetry.&#x201D; 
                            It is unlikely that one can coordinate these opposite modes of expression&#x2014;private anger and resentment, and public detachment&#x2014;reliably with authorial intention 
                            respecting private, confidential, and public audience, since most pieces will appear to adopt the detachment appropriate to an imagined public 
                            (i.e., what <persName corresp="#DHR">Reiman</persName> terms &#x201C;polished&#x201D; confidential manuscripts). 
                            It is true that signs of psychological disturbance seems to emerge more consistently in rough&#x2010;draft works than in 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s fair&#x2010;copy manuscripts, 
                            but we do not know to what extent <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> kept the rough&#x2010;draft notebooks private. 
                            The presence of his father&#x02BC;s hand marking some drafts suggests that these notebooks were never secret. 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s intentions, therefore, will seem all but uniformly to point in the direction of &#x201C;polished&#x201D; confidentiality,
                            as in much nineteenth&#x2010;century juvenilia, while proving a deceptive indicator of the emotional bearings of a work. 
                            Private emotion that jars with an intention of public address (or the imitation of public address) is more likely to be signaled by rhetorical or accidental features 
                            such as fragmentation. It is no accident that, even sixty years after their composition, fragmented works were banned from publication in 
                            <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s edition of the <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (<date when="1891">1891</date>)</title>,
                            such works having been deemed by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself or someone in his circle as holding &#x201C;&#x2018;too slight interest&#x2019;&#x201D; 
                            as <persName corresp="#CEN">Charles Eliot Norton</persName> would have said, but also as indicating what was &#x201C;&#x2018;too personal, too intimate&#x2019;&#x201D;

                            analyzing almost any juvenilia since that relation will typically be limited to a confidential one. 
                            Nineteenth&#x2010;century juvenilia often calls for a biographical approach, which aligns the emotion suggested by a work with the writer&#x02BC;s 
                            pyschological relation with a specific family member. In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s case, some works explicitly concern 
                            emotional relations with one parent or the other, as in <ref type="apparatus" target="on_papas_leaving_home_apparatus.php">&#x201C;On Papat&#x02BC;s Leaving Home&#x201D;</ref>, 
                            and I have argued in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HANSONSELFANDREVISION">&#x201C;Self and Revision in Ruskin&#x02BC;s Revaluations of Romanticism&#x201D;</ref>, 
                            for example, that some works can be explained as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s angry response to his <persName corresp="#MR">mother</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            attempts to stem his poetry writing. Specific stories in the Bront&#x00EB; sagas, similarly, 
                            have been interpreted in terms of sibling rivalries. These biographical and psychoanalytic arguments about text can overlap with physical evidence in a manuscript 
                            that might be systematically transcribed and classified, such as signs of heavy revision combined with textual fragmentation. 
                            There is too little evidence, however, to link such features with the identity of specific readers in the Ruskin household. The hands of both <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName> and his <persName corresp="#MR">mother</persName> occur occasionally in the notebooks,  
                            and the fact that only his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName>&#x02BC;s hand appears in the rough&#x2010;draft notebooks 
                            may suggest that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> could control which parent viewed certain pieces, but such evidence cannot be verified.-->

                        <p>The archive contains, at the most fundamental level, two sets of edited primary materials: 
                            <hi rend="italic">works</hi> and <hi rend="italic">manuscripts</hi>.</p>
                        <list type="ordered">
                            <item>A <hi rend="italic">work</hi> in this edition consists of a discrete text
                                by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> (e.g., a poem, an essay, a
                                sermon, a mathematical proof), including all available witnesses of that
                                text (each of these edited and annotated), and accompanied by the
                                work&#x02BC;s explanatory apparatus and available facsimiles.</item>
                            <item>A <hi rend="italic">manuscript</hi> is a physical document manifesting
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s texts. 
                                A given work may be confined, so far as presently known, to a single text witness found in a single manuscript; 
                                or a work may be made up of multiple text witnesses found in more than one manuscript.</item></list>
                        <p>In the archive, a work is represented by diplomatic transcriptions of all available witnesses, from its manuscript through its nineteenth&#x2010;century 
                                published instantiations, the range typically terminating in a version published in the 
                                <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 
                                which launched in <date when="1903">1903</date> with editions of the <title type="book" corresp="JRWORKSLE_EARLYPROSE"><hi rend="italic">Early Prose</hi></title> and <title type="book" corresp="JRWORKSLE_POEMS"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title>. 
                                All transcriptions are annotated with glosses, both textual and contextual, 
                                and each work is introduced by a descriptive and critical apparatus.</p>
                        <p>Traditionally in Ruskin studies, major manuscripts, which were originally bound notebooks or bound later by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s editors, 
                            were numbered by the editors; and the manuscripts&#x02BC; nomenclature and physical arrangement were retained 
                            when distributed among various repositories. In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, these major manuscripts 
                            are each represented by a critical apparatus; and facsimiles of the major manuscripts are presented both in whole 
                            and in part, divided into pages associated with each of the discreet <hi rend="italic">works</hi> that make up the contents of the manuscripts.</p>
                        <p>Besides the commentary attached to specific works and manuscripts (the apparatuses and glosses), other commentary, 
                                which is hyperlinked throughout the archive, includes notes summarizing biographical, bibliographical, geographical, and contextual information. 
                                For illustrating the Ruskin family journeys, maps with timelines are under development 
                                (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="plan_of_archive_note.php">Plan of the Archive</ref>).</p>
                        
                        <p>As translated into Web pages, these two sets of materials form, respectively, a given work&#x02BC;s Work Pages,
                            and a given manuscript&#x02BC;s Manuscript Pages. This design was initially based on the organization of  
                            <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (<date when="1891">1891</date>)</title></ref> 
                            by its editor, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="collingwood_w_g_note.php"><persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName></ref>; and on the similar organization of the 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title></ref> by its editors 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="cook_e_t_note.php"><persName corresp="#ETC">E. T. Cook</persName></ref> and

                            Similarly, these earlier patterns of organization were reflected in the approaches to bibliographical description by 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="viljoen_h_g_note.php"><persName corresp="#HGV">Helen Viljoen</persName></ref>. 
                            The present editor, <persName corresp="#DCH">David Hanson</persName>, absorbed <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName>&#x02BC;s notes on the early manuscripts through the generosity
                            of <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName>, when <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName>&#x02BC;s papers remained in his keeping, 
                            and later when <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> deposited her papers at the <orgName corresp="#MORGANLIBRARY">Pierpont Morgan Library</orgName>.</p>
                        
                        <p>While building on these past approaches, <persName corresp="#DCH">Hanson</persName> came to recognize how the organization of the archive into separate <hi rend="italic">works</hi> with their respective bodies of commentary&#x2014;poems, 
                            essays, sermons, and so on&#x2014;lent necessary bibliographic commentary but concealed a dynamic tension that interested <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x2014;a 
                            tension between a given textual work and the material manuscript containing it, the container often presenting 
                            possibilities for expansion that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> exploited and explored. From the earliest juvenilia, 
                            he was evidently fascinated by the dynamic potential of a work to contain or be contained by something else. 
                            If <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> carried on in the path of earlier editions, 
                            routinely separating &#x201C;lexical codes&#x201D; from &#x201C;bibliographical codes&#x201D; according to historical precedent, 
                            we would achieve apparent clarity on the archive but at the expense of a characteristically Ruskinian feature.</p></div>

                        <p>Editing the early <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts calls for representing both the integrity of a unitary work 
                            and what <persName corresp="#NF">Neil Fraistat</persName> terms its <hi rend="italic">contexture</hi>&#x2014;the work&#x02BC;s 
                            potential to contribute to some grander stage of organization (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRAISTATPOEMANDTHEBOOK"><persName corresp="#NF">Fraistat</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#FRAISTATPOEMANDTHEBOOK"><hi rend="italic">The Poem and the Book</hi></title></ref>, 4).
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> used his manuscripts to build contexture among the works they contain, sometimes exploring loose associations among rapidly drafted, successive fragments in the rough&#x2010;draft notebooks, 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msvi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title></ref> and <ref type="apparatus" target="msviii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title></ref>, 
                            and sometimes treating manuscripts as &#x201C;volumes&#x201D; or miscellanies in an expanding corpus&#x2014;the individual volumes themselves often made up partly of anthologies, as 
                            found in several of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref> and in 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msv_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title></ref>, <ref type="apparatus" target="msvii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title></ref>, and

                            To represent both the contexture of the unitary work and the integrity of the unitary work in itself, 
                            <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> uses the <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> element, &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009;, 
                            combined with standoff markup using <title type="program" corresp="#XINCLUDE">XInclude</title>. Since &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; can both contain and be contained by other &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; documents, 
                            we have found that the element serves as the most available means to represent <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s double centeredness in both work and manuscript, text and contexture.</p>
                        <p>A simplified schematization of the &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; markup representing <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref> appears as follows.</p>

                            is the bound <hi rend="italic">manuscript</hi>, which <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="collingwood_w_g_note.php"><persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName></ref> 
                            likewise recognized as the chief entity of the archive, and which he numbered 
                            according to a rough chronological sequence by roman numeral in his <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note&#x201D;</title>.
                            In the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>, <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> expanded on 
                            <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note&#x201D;</title> by listing all of the titles of works contained in each of these bound manuscripts, 
                            listing the titles in the sequence in which they occur (which is not necessarily an indication of their order of composition). 
                            They did the same for collections that were not originally bound, rather that they had gathered and bound themselves (usually in red buckram), entitled with a roman numeral, 
                            and inserted into their expanded version of <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note&#x201D;</title>. 
                            This attention to the bound manuscript as a container did not fundamentally affect editorial practice in either <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s or

                            their practices still centered on the discrete text, presented chronologically. In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> likewise, we transcribe and annotate discrete works 
                            (using a documentary approach, not the earlier editors&#x02BC; eclectic and aesthetic approaches), but we also seek to describe 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s strategies for contexture. The results are expressed as what the user finds listed on the Index Page

                        <p>Manuscripts that were bound when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first used them (e.g., the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref>, 
                            ledgers, and other half&#x2010; or quarter&#x2010;calf notebooks) presented a space defined by the parameters of their covers, 
                            which he conceptualized filling (at least initially) in some cases as &#x201C;volumes&#x201D; in a series, 
                            such as the volumes of the &#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D; lessons, along with their complementary poetry anthologies (e.g.,

                            and which he formed in other cases as miscellanies, such as the

                            The term <hi rend="italic">corpora</hi> is reserved in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> for those collections showing particularly strong contexture,

                            evolved as composite, multi&#x2010;genre compilations, such as the

                        <p>The distinction between corpora and major manuscripts admittedly is ambiguous, with the contexture of corpora elevated by only a degree of intentionality above that of major manuscripts&#x2014;the 
                            latter exhibiting looser but still definable contexture, such as <ref type="apparatus" target="msv_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title></ref>, 
                            which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> compiled incrementally, open&#x2010;endedly, and apparently somewhat randomly, 
                            one fair&#x2010;copy poem after another, yet still definably as &#x201C;Miscellaneous Poetry&#x201D;. 
                            In terms of <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> markup, both corpora and manuscripts are enclosed by the same &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; element. 
                            The slippage of one category into the other reflects <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            own dynamic process of containment and expansion. He was even apt at times, like <persName corresp="#WW">Wordsworth</persName>, to think of the entirety 
                            of his &#x201C;works&#x201D; as a single corpus, as suggested by his annotation on 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title></ref>.</p>
                        <p>A more conventional way of representing anthologies in <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> markup is to enclose multiple, related texts with the &#x3008;group&#x3009; element. 
                            Since this element can nest only within a &#x3008;TEI&#x3009; document, 
                            and unlike &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; cannot itself contain a &#x3008;TEI&#x3009; document, 
                            the &#x3008;group&#x3009; element is too inflexible to accommodate <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>&#x02BC;s design for both single works and corpora or manuscripts. 
                            Single works are represented by multiple &#x3008;TEI&#x3009; documents&#x2014;typically, an apparatus, multiple witnesses and facsimiles, and glosses&#x2014;while 
                            corpora and manuscripts are also represented by multiple &#x3008;TEI&#x3009; documents, including an apparatus plus the sequence of works comprised by the collection 
                            (each work again consisting of its multiple &#x3008;TEI&#x3009; documents). An advantage that the &#x3008;group&#x3009; element holds over &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; 
                            is that the former is designed to accommodate a &#x3008;head&#x3009; element, which would more satisfyingly encode a title, such as 
                            <title type="anthology" corresp="#MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">&#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; [MS I Poetry Anthology]</title>, as compared with what is shown in the sample markup above. 
                            Instead, using &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009;, either one must attach the anthology title as a &#x3008;head&#x3009; to the germane witness of the first item in the anthology, 
                            which is badly formed markup; or, as we have done above, one must insert the title as a separate <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> document. Arguably, however, 
                            the latter procedure is as well&#x2010;formed as it is valid in the frequent cases in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s titles and title pages 
                            refuse to conform to the structures that the &#x3008;group&#x3009; element was designed to describe. The &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; element more flexibly 
                            accounts for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s dynamic play with the relation between container and contained.</p>
                        <p>For example, in the originally blank, pre&#x2010;bound notebook that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> named 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref>, 
                            and that the Ruskin family knew as one of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref>, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> used the inside front endboard to make a title page for a text, 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                            possibly intending the work, at least initially, to be coextensive with the entirety of the physical notebook 
                            (see <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php#TITLE"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy Concluded&#x201D;</title>: Title</ref>, and 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php#TITLE">MS I: Title</ref>). Whatever his initial plan was, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            completed <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Volume I&#x201D;</title> of this prose work without filling the notebook&#x2014;a terminus
                            that he declared by inscribing &#x201C;end of Harry and Lucy&#x201D;, and carrying on by adding an anthology,

                            This, too, reached a terminus, which he declared with a colophon:</p>

                        </floatingText>
                        <p>This colophon reflects the play of closure by declaring a second ending&#x2014;the &#x201C;end of the poems&#x201D;&#x2014;specifying 
                            the end of the poetry anthology. This declaration was erased by somebody, using a rough pencil scratchout, 
                            perhaps in order to shift the emphasis to the end of a larger entity comprising 
                            <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">volume 1 of &#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title> plus the poetry anthology, 
                            <title type="anthology" corresp="#MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">&#x201C;Poetry&#x201D;</title>. The colophon had perceptibly altered the usage of &#x201C;volume&#x201D; 
                            on the original title page of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title>, which was clearly meant to apply only to the prose work. 
                            Were we instead to use the &#x3008;group&#x3009; element, which calls for a &#x3008;front&#x3009; element to contain frontmatter, we could not represent a title page 
                            that is in flux. We may not have described <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s dynamically developing ideas much more vividly using &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009;, but at least we have not misrepresented his ideas.</p>
                        <p>Our usage of &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; also permits description of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s manuscripts and corpora as collaborative or mediated documents, 
                            which were sometimes glossed by his parents. We do not know who scored through &#x201C;end of the poems&#x201D; in the colophon of 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref>, 
                            but it was certainly <persName corresp="#MR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s mother</persName> who inserted a gloss 
                            amid the poems making up <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">&#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; [MS I Poetry Anthology]</title></ref>. 
                            She wanted to date precisely her son&#x02BC;s beginning and completion of the manuscript. 
                            The determinacy of <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s gloss, with its definite &#x201C;this book begun&#x201D; and &#x201C;finished&#x201D;,
                            competes with the ambivalent play of <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s closure 
                            (see <ref type="apparatus" target="mr_gloss_dating_msi_apparatus.php"><title type="gloss" corresp="#MRGLOSSMSI">Margaret Ruskin&#x02BC;s Gloss on the Dating of MS I</title></ref>). 
                            While not necessarily intended to impose her will on the manuscript, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s gloss proved 
                            as ambiguous as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own colophon, 
                            since both were followed by a new work entered on the inside back endboard&#x2014;an emblematical drawing, 
                            <ref type="drawing" target="heights_of_wisdom_drawing_msi.php">&#x201C;Heights of Wisdom, Depth of Fools&#x201D;</ref>, which 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> dated a few months later than <persName corresp="#MR">his mother</persName>&#x02BC;s gloss. 
                            Such play, whether including an edge of competitiveness or joy of collaboration, cannot be fully described in terms of an 
                            <title type="program" corresp="#XML">XML</title> structure; the dynamics of play can be interpreted and discussed only in the archive&#x02BC;s commentary. 
                            However, the contributions of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s parents are very often convincingly encoded as glosses, 
                            which are not in the same class as the editor&#x02BC;s explanatory and textual glosses that hang from and refer only to specific texts, 
                            but which form stand&#x2010;alone <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> documents (including their own apparatuses and transcriptions) 
                            referring to and forming part of the corpus as a whole.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; markup also easily allows for reordering corpora athwart manuscripts. In the case of 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php"><title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</title></ref>, 
                            an eclectic editorial approach was adopted both by <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> and by <persName corresp="#ETC">E. T. Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName> 
                            on the grounds that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> left extensive writing for the work in draft 
                            along with an ambitious outline for arranging and completing the work; however, prior to realizing that plan, he abandoned the fair copy, 
                            requiring copytext to be drawn from both the fair copy and the draft. <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> justified his approach in <date when="1891">1891</date> as follows: 
                            &#x201C;[A]s I find from a list at the end of . . . <ref type="apparatus" target="msviii_apparatus.php">[MS] VIII</ref>&#x201D;

                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> &#x201C;intended this volume [i.e., the <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX fair copy</ref>] 
                            to contain about 150 pieces of prose and poetry, and at least as many drawings! 
                            And in saying [in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>] that he did not follow his tour beyond the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>, <persName corresp="#JR">Mr. Ruskin</persName> 
                            refers only to this volume, <ref type="apparatus" target="msix_apparatus.php">No. IX</ref>&#x201D;, and not to what he had in fact composed. 
                            &#x201C;I am pretty certain that he was not aware of the amount of material existing in rough copies at the back of his book&#x2010;shelves&#x201D;

                            making up the uncompleted &#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D; narrative,

                            in which the bonds between the sermon texts are stronger than their ties to the manuscripts in which the texts are found. 
                            While arguably the five handsewn booklets containing the fair copies of the sermons 
                            can be treated as a single corpus, the various <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref> 
                            containing rough drafts of the sermons present a particularly attenuated claim on the texts as composing a portion of their corpora considered as manuscripts. 
                            By the time <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> entered the sermon drafts in the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref>, 
                            these notebooks had been demoted to providing leftover, unused space for miscellaneous draft, and the sermon texts run reverso and upside&#x2010;down to what was once a vital corpus.</p>
                        <p>Yet another candidate for &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; markup to describe multiple and conjectural corpora are those that were compiled neither by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            nor his editors, but by members of his circle who were interested in creating anthologies for some special purpose. For example, as previously mentioned, in <date when="1831">1831</date> 
                            <persName corresp="#MR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s mother</persName> proposed that <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> 
                            make a small &#x201C;parcel&#x201D; of letters and poems to be shared with their intimate friends, the Grays. Such anthologies reveal assumptions 
                            about the intended audience of youthful writing in the nineteenth century (see <ref type="internal" target="#PRIVATE">The Private, Confidential, and Public in the Early Manuscripts</ref>).</p>

                        <p>In our transcription policy, we strive to abide by the definition of textual transcription proposed by 
                            <persName corresp="DLVM">David Vander Meulen</persName> and <persName corresp="GTT">G. Thomas Tanselle</persName>: 
                            &#x201C;the transcriber&#x02BC;s goal is to make an informed decision about what is actually inscribed at each point&#x201D; in a manuscript, 
                            although of course editorial &#x201C;judgment is necessarily involved in deciding what is in fact present&#x201D;, 
                            &#x201C;as when an ambiguously formed character resembles two different letters&#x201D;. Despite these calls on editorial judgment, which must be notated, 
                            in a documentary editorial procedure the resulting &#x201C;text cannot simultaneously be unemended and emended&#x201D; 
                            since &#x201C;no single text&#x201D; can be both a transcription and a critical text; these &#x201C;are mutually exclusive genres&#x201D; of editing, 
                            although the same <hi rend="italic">edition</hi> might contain both transcriptions and emended, critical texts 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#VANDERMEULENTANSELLETRANSCRIPTION"><persName corresp="DLVM">Vander Meulen</persName> and <persName corresp="GTT">Tanselle</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#VANDERMEULENTANSELLETRANSCRIPTION">&#x201C;System of Manuscript Transcription&#x201D;</title></ref>, 201, 203).</p>
                        <p>For most works in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, the editor supplies documentary transcriptions of witnesses paired with facsimiles (if available) of those witnesses. 
                            The archive also provides, as it were, documentary transcriptions of past critical texts of the works, because we believe that researchers will benefit 
                            by being able to study, in close proximity with accurate transcriptions of manuscript witnesses, how <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s first editors 
                            saw fit to represent those manuscripts to readers.</p>
                        <p>The editor is responsible for the accuracy of all transcriptions of witnesses in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, having taken most of them himself 
                            over several years from the original manuscripts in the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke Library</orgName>, <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale University</orgName>; 
                            the <orgName corresp="#BERG">Berg Collection, New York Public Library</orgName>; the <orgName corresp="#HUNTINGTON">Huntington Library</orgName>; 
                            the <orgName corresp="#MORGANLIBRARY">Pierpont Morgan Library</orgName>; <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Rare Books and Special Collections, Princeton University Library</orgName>; 
                            the <orgName corresp="#RUSKINMUSEUMCONISTON">Ruskin Museum, Coniston</orgName>; and <orgName corresp="RUSKINLIBRARYLANCASTER">The Ruskin</orgName>, <orgName corresp="#LANCASTERU">Lancaster University</orgName>. 
                            Later, the project acquired facsimiles in the form of high&#x2010;resolution tiff files from the the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke Library</orgName>, which have helped to confirm and improve on 
                            the editor&#x02BC;s original transcriptions, and which are exhibited in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>. The editor is also responsible for final decisions 
                            about the interpretation of doubtful readings of manuscripts and for notating these decisions with textual glosses. In scattered instances, mostly involving manuscripts 
                            used to supplement annotation of the works contained in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, the editor initially had time in the physical archives 
                            only to describe a manuscript and gather information for a critical apparatus, and not to transcribe its contents completely; 
                            in those cases, we have sometimes been able to capture a transcription based on a high&#x2010;resolution facsimile. This procedure is noted where it occurs, 
                            with the expectation of later revisiting the physical manuscript.</p>
                        <p>For support of archival research as well as imaging of the manuscripts, the editor and the Digital Humanities program at 
                            <orgName corresp="#SOUTHEASTERNU">Southeastern Louisiana University</orgName> are indebted to the agencies listed on the 
                            <ref type="webpage" target="staff.php">Staff and Support</ref> page. Without the travel grants and fellowships awarded by these agencies, 
                            the research underpinning <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> would not have been possible. The editor is also grateful to the staffs of these libraries and archives, 
                            who shared their expertise and supported our research.</p>
                        <p>In the earliest stage of developing the digital archive beyond the research and writing, <persName corresp="#RGARSIDE">Roger Garside</persName>, 
                            formerly senior lecturer in the <orgName corresp="#LANCASTERUCOMPUTING">Department of Computing, Lancaster University</orgName>,
                            devised a helpful program for translating the editor&#x02BC;s word processing files into lightly <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName>&#x2010;encoded 
                            <title type="program" corresp="#XML">XML</title>, and for generating transformations in the form of <title type="program" corresp="#HTML">HTML</title> pages. 
                            This program was subsequently replaced as we elaborated our ideas about describing the early <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts 
                            with <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> markup, and also as we pursued a pedagogy for introducing students to <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> 
                            encoding and to the craft of designing and building online scholarly resources. <persName corresp="#RGARSIDE">Garside</persName>&#x02BC;s program, however, 
                            was foundational for helping us to envision the architecture of the archive. Meanwhile, to advance the Digital Humanities program at 
                            <orgName corresp="#SOUTHEASTERNU">Southeastern Louisiana University</orgName>, we benefited from consultation by <persName corresp="#SBAUMAN">Syd Bauman</persName>, 
                            <persName corresp="#MCHRISTY">Matthew Christy</persName>, <persName corresp="#JFLANDERS">Julia Flanders</persName>, <persName corresp="#LMANDELL">Laura Mandell</persName>, 
                            <persName corresp="#DPARKER">Dot Porter</persName>, <persName corresp="#LWOOF">Lawrence Woof</persName>, and the staff of the <date when="2005">2005</date> 
                            <orgName corresp="#NINES">NINES</orgName> Summer Workshop in Digital Scholarship at the <orgName corresp="VIRGINIAU">University of Viriginia</orgName>. 
                            <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> is indebted to these individuals and their institutions for their generosity and good will, 
                            which has persisted long beyond their respective workshops or consultations that got us started.</p>
                        <p>In the ongoing addition of new files to the archive, the following routines are observed by the encoding team. First, using the <orgName corresp="#OXYGEN">SyncRO Soft Oxygen</orgName> XML editor, 
                            encoders pull the word&#x2010;processed files of the Editor&#x02BC;s original transcript(s) of a work, along with files of his apparatus and other annotation, 
                            into appropriate templates built for the varying document types included in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>. In a first pass, encoders mark up the Editor&#x02BC;s original 
                            transcription and commentary according to the <title type="program" corresp="#TEIP5">TEI P5</title> standard; and the encoder checks the editor&#x02BC;s original transcript 
                            against its manuscript facsimile, querying any possible inaccuracies. Team members are instructed to confirm transcription of every deliberate mark on a manuscript, 
                            in whatever hand. The Editor then reviews the transcription and encoding against the facsimile, and he revises and extends the commentary.</p>
                        <p>As <persName corresp="#DLVM">Vander Meulen</persName> and <persName corresp="#GTT">Tanselle</persName> comment: &#x201C;Obviously a transcription 
                            cannot exactly reproduce the relative precision or carelessness with which handwritten letters are formed, or their relative sizes, or the amount of space 
                            between words and lines; but it can aim to record every ink or pencil marking of textual significance on the manuscript&#x2014;all letters, punctuation, superscripts, 
                            canceled matter, lines linking or excising passages, and so on&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#VANDERMEULENTANSELLETRANSCRIPTION">&#x201C;System of Manuscript Transcription&#x201D;</ref>, 201). 
                            We consider this aim, and nothing less, as defining the standard for first&#x2010;pass conversion of the editor&#x02BC;s original files, 
                            and for checking or completing transcription against its facsimile at this first stage, because it is impractical and an invitation to oversight to reserve some 
                            portion of transcription for a later stage. One can and should review the accuracy and thoroughness of transcription as often as one likes, but no systematic 
                            procedure for dividing a thorough transcription into stages would be practical, since one would have to redefine the procedure constantly in order to address 
                            the peculiarities of each manuscript.</p>
                        <p>To maintain consistency of markup in this process, the encoding team references an internal Encoding Guide, compiled by the supervising encoder, 
                            which lists every element, attribute, and value so far employed in the archive, and which is continually updated, as additional <title type="program" corresp="#TEIP5">TEI</title> 
                            elements and attributes or <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> values are discussed and added by the team. The team also constantly references and updates 
                            a project&#x2010;based Regularization Crib, which is a <title type="program" corresp="#MSEXCEL">Microsoft Excel</title> spreadsheet listing every 
                            <title type="program" corresp="#XML">XML</title> file name by category&#x2014;the names, that is, of files in the document&#x2010;type categories of 
                            apparatuses, manuscripts, witnesses, anthologies, drawings, essays, notes, and glosses. The Regularization Crib also lists all standardized editorial titles 
                            for these entities; and it serves as the encoders&#x02BC; crib for hex&#x2010;codes for special characters, <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>&#x02BC;s xml:ids for all proper names, 
                            titles, and bibliography entries used in the archive, the names used to identify hands, and dates and date ranges used to mark historical events. 
                            The team (mainly, in this case, the editor and supervising encoder) continually updates the Regularization Cri  as new works, manuscripts, and commentary are added to the archive.</p>
                        <p>To manage workflow, <!--the team uses a shared&#x2010;file system, <title type="program" corresp="#DROPBOX">Dropbox</title>, by <orgName corresp="#DROPBOXINC">Dropbox Incorporated</orgName>-->, 
                            <!--Encoders work within their assigned <title type="program" corresp="#DROPBOX">Dropbox</title> folders, and for each -->
                            encoders add their name and responsibility to the header of each <title type="program" corresp="#TEI">TEI</title> file they edit. When ready for review, 
                            the <title type="program" corresp="#XML">XML</title> file is moved (not copied) from the encoder&#x02BC;s folder and into a reviewer&#x02BC;s folder, 
                            in order to guard against accidental confusion and overwriting of files. The Editor examines first&#x2010;pass encoding for accuracy, consulting both his notes 
                            from on&#x2010;site archival research and the facsimile. After the Editor has reviewed a file for accuracy of transcription and markup, along with consistency with the <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> Encoding Guide and Regularization Crib, 
                            it is uploaded for transformation by <title type="program" corresp="#XSLT">XSLT</title> and the resulting HTML checked for errors.</p>
                        <p>The team steadily adds new works and manuscripts to the archive, and the Editor constantly researches and develops the commentary 
                            in apparatuses, notes, and glosses in order to increase the usefulness of the archive for researchers. At any given time, hyperlinks to notes are embedded 
                            in the <title type="program" corresp="#XML">XML</title> files that are presently inactive because the source notes are unfinished. 
                            When a source note is completed and added to the archive, any pre&#x2010;existing links to it should become active. All files are subject to revision and reloading 
                            with an appropriately updated version number.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>Because editing in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> is documentary, we transcribe without correction <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s (remarkably rare) 
                            misspellings and grammatical errors. Also, we retain his capitalizations, ampersands, and unhyphenated spaces in such words such as <hi rend="italic">to day</hi>, 
                            <hi rend="italic">every day</hi>, <hi rend="italic">every one</hi>, and so on. If <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> omits letters from words, 
                            he usually does so to serve poetic meter. Since the reader can in most cases compare the edited transcript against the facsimile, 
                            the cause of an apparent anomaly will be evident (e.g., doubled letters arising from dividing a word between lines, or doubled words occurring before and after page breaks); 
                            nonetheless, potentially confusing anomalies and other distinctive manuscript features receive discussion in a textual gloss. 
                            Some of the most anomalous and challenging markup decisions are presented by the earliest juvenilia, in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> invented his own

                                and because he was interested in the material presentation of his manuscripts, he adopted a range of copybook scripts from handwriting manuals, and he imitated 
                                various print typefaces, which he found in favorite books printed between the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1839">1820s and 1830s</date>.

                                and assigned an xml:id, which, in the case of <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hands, 
                                identifies a date range (usually a calendar year or two) along with any broad strokes 
                                that may be used to classify the holograph among a group of manuscripts sharing a peculiarity of hand. 
                                In the case of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s and 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hands, no attempt is made to use the xml:id to refine the classification of their hands, 
                                which retain a stable script throughout the holographs contained in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>.</p>
                            <p>Within the &#x3008;text&#x3009; of the TEI document for each holograph witness, which may contain more than one hand, 
                                &#x3008;handShift&#x3009; is used to select the xml:id from &#x3008;handNote&#x3009; that identifies the hand responsible 
                                for a given range of text, until a different hand intervenes, at which point &#x3008;handShift&#x3009; toggles to identify the change with the appropriate xml:id. 
                                The &#x3008;handShift&#x3009; element also carries attributes of &#x0040;script and &#x0040;medium, 
                                which are assigned broad values&#x2014;for &#x0040;script, typically &#x201C;print&#x201D;, &#x201C;cursive&#x201D;, 
                                or an easily classifiable cursive such as &#x201C;copperplate&#x201D;; and for &#x0040;medium, 
                                typically &#x201C;pencil&#x201D; and &#x201C;ink&#x201D;. These broad classifications are described in 
                                <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</ref>, 
                                while the eccentricities of the hand used for any given manuscript are relegated to discussion in the apparatus for the work in question, 
                                rather than burdening markup values for &#x0040;script and &#x0040;medium with additional refinements such as colors of ink. 
                                However, where clusters of manuscripts manifest peculiarities of hand, which may be used to help date works 
                                and otherwise flag relationships among projects, these classes of handwriting are captured in the values assigned to 
                                &#x0040;script and &#x0040;medium and may also be coded along with the date range as part of the xml:id given in &#x3008;handNote&#x3009;.</p>
                            <p>Where <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> imitates a special character in the style of a typeface, we highlight these using the &#x3008;hi&#x3009; element, 
                                with the &#x0040;rend value keyed to such special usages as &#x201C;doubleletter&#x201D; and &#x201C;doubleletter&#x2010;fill&#x201D;.</p>

                        <div type="sub-subsection" xml:id="JUSTIFICATION">
                            <head type="sub-subsection">Justification, Runover, and Word Division</head>
                            <p>As discussed in <ref type="internal" target="#MATERIALITY">Expressing the Materiality of the Manuscripts</ref>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                                invented a mark to justify right and left margins in fair&#x2010;copy prose, which saved him from having to adjust space between words in a line of text. 
                                To fill the gap to the margin, he inserted a horizontal mark of variable length (and sometimes of variable appearance, shaped like an equal sign or a tilde). 
                                Since it would misrepresent the mark&#x02BC;s purpose to encode it according to its appearance in length as a hyphen, en&#x2010;dash, or em&#x2010;dash, 
                                or some other symbol, we use a glyph element, assigning it a &#x0040;type &#x201C;justification&#x201D; 
                                as follows:<lb/>
                                <lb/>
                            <hi rend="center">&#x3008;g type&#x003D;&#x201C;justification&#x201D;&#x3009;-&#x3008;/g&#x3009;.</hi>
                            <lb/></p>
                            <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> often indicated paragraph breaks as minimally as possible. Whether because he meant to use space on a page efficiently, 
                                or because he liked the appearance of a more solid block of text, he often failed to indent a word beginning a new paragraph. The intention of a paragraph break 
                                can be signaled, despite the lack of indentation, by a significant gap between the end of a preceding line and the right margin, with no justification mark used 
                                to take up the slack. Sometimes, however, he fills such spaces with stars, like asterisks, and the following line still seems meant as a new paragraph. 
                                Signals become especially confusing when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> ends a block of text with a dash, which serves some rhetorical purpose 
                                such as an excited pause, and which would be indistinguishable from a justification mark apart from white space following it. In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, 
                                therefore, we insert paragraph breaks in a text when both sense and some definite scribal feature&#x2014;such as significant space at the end of a preceding 
                                line, and/or a rare indentation at the start of the next line&#x2014;seem to call for a new paragraph. If the manuscript evidence is ambiguous, 
                                the editorial decision is marked by a textual gloss.</p>
                            <p>We encode where line breaks fall in prose manuscripts, and we render these as breaks in the <title type="program" corresp="#XSLT">XSLT</title> transformation, 
                                so that prose witnesses match their facsimiles. In poetry, if <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote an extension of a line as a runover, 
                                the line&#x2010;break element &#x3008;lb/&#x3009; is inserted at the start of the runover text within the transcribed line, and the element is assigned a 
                                &#x0040;type &#x201C;runover&#x201D;, thus:<lb/>
                                <lb/>
                                <hi rend="center">&#x3008;lb type&#x003D;&#x201C;runover&#x201D;/&#x3009;&#x3008;space quantity&#x003D;&#x201C;00&#x201D; unit&#x003D;&#x201C;chars&#x201D;/&#x3009;.</hi>
                                <lb/></p>
                                <p>Here the &#x3008;space&#x3009; element quantifies the number of characters that the runover is indented from the left text margin. 
                                (In <title type="program" corresp="#XSLT">XSLT</title> transformation, the runover also renders as an interlineation.)</p>
                            <p>In some cases of line runover in poetry, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> also signaled the runover with a mark that, in some places, 
                                resembles an opening square bracket and, in others, a vertical bar. Usually, he placed this mark at the start of the indented runover line. 
                                One can find such a symbol in early nineteenth&#x2010;century periodicals using narrow columns, thus causing multiple runovers in printing of poetry; 
                                however, printers appear to have reserved this punctuation to identify a runover that they were obliged to set <hi rend="italic">above</hi> its line, 
                                and therefore needed to punctuate in order to distinguish from other runovers in the same poem set as usual below the line, 
                                and without such a mark. Several examples can be found in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#LITERARYGAZETTEBELLESLETTRES"><hi rend="italic">London Literary Gazette, and Journal of Belles Lettres, Arts, Sciences, &#x0026;c.</hi></title>, 
                                which uses the opening square bracket to mark a runover set above its line&#x2014;typically, a line that simultaneously carries a runover appearing below the preceding line of verse, 
                                and therefore set without the mark 
                                (see, e.g., <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ALMOTHERSMORNINGKISS"><persName type="pen_name" corresp="#A.L.">A.L.</persName>, <title type="poem" corresp="#ALMOTHERSMORNINGKISS">&#x201C;A Mother&#x02BC;s Morning Kiss to Her Child&#x201D;)</title></ref>. 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> does not necessarily reserve use of the mark for this specialized class of runovers, 
                                but may apply it indiscriminately to any runover. As an example, see the opening line of 
                                <ref type="witness" target="the_defiance_of_war_msi.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEDEFIANCEOFWAR">&#x201C;The Defiance of War&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                                which is encoded as follows:<lb/>
                                <lb/>
                                <hi rend="center">&#x3008;l&#x3009;War war thou art beating thy&#x3008;lb type&#x003D;&#x201C;runover&#x201D;/&#x3009;&#x3008;space quantity&#x003D;&#x201C;28&#x201D; unit&#x003D;&#x201C;chars&#x201D;/&#x3009;&#x3008;g type&#x003D;&#x201C;runover&#x201D;&#x3009;[&#x3008;/g&#x3009;drum&#x3008;l/&#x3009;.</hi>
                                <lb/>

                            <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> sometimes used a mark to indicate word division at the end of a line. Like his justification mark, 
                                he varied the word&#x2010;division sign in length from a mere dot to an em&#x2010;dash, and in appearance from a horizontal line to something resembling an equal sign. 
                                All of these marks are interpreted without comment and encoded as a hyphen, since the intention is obvious in both facsimile and transcript. 
                                Sometimes he divided a word without using any mark at all, if his justified right margin did allow the space; in these cases, no mark is encoded and the line break is 
                                represented without comment&#x2014;the intention again being obvious in facsimile and transcript.</p>
                            <p>One word division mark does call for special treatment, since it appears confusingly redundant. In some cases, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> uses not only 
                                a mark at the right justified margin to denote a break but also at the left justified margin on the line below. Typically, the latter takes a form resembling an equal sign. 
                                When this mark appears at the left margin and is clearly functioning to signal word division, we tag it as a glyph element, &#x0040;type &#x201C;word_division&#x201D;:<lb/>
                                <lb/>

                            <head type="sub-subsection">Commas, Periods, Quotation Marks, and Other Punctuation</head>
                            <p>In the earliest prose works, dating from <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1827">1826&#x2013;27</date>, such as "Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I" and letters,
                                Ruskin closes sentences with terminal punctuation, periods and question marks, but he uses no internal punctuation. 
                                Verse from the same period is in many cases devoid of punctuation altogether, with the exception of apostrophes for possessives; 
                                only a few poems close with a period at the end, as if punctuating the entire poem rather than the end of a sentence. 
                                In the MS I Poetry Anthology, only the final poem, 
                                <ref type="apparatus" target="on_the_rainbow_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="JRONTHERAINBOW">&#x201C;On the Rainbow&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                                introduces sentence periods internally along with commas at line breaks.</p>
                                
                            <p>The commas in <ref type="apparatus" target="on_the_rainbow_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="JRONTHERAINBOW">&#x201C;On the Rainbow&#x201D;</title></ref> were squeezed in using carets; 
                                and in both prose and poems of <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1828">1827&#x2013;28</date>, internal punctuation appears to have been inserted all at once. 
                                In both the first fair-copy of "The Constellations" and in the MS III fair copy of "The Monastery", 
                                a portion of the poem abruptly birstles with punctuation and then just as abruptly vanishes altogether from the poem. 
                                This superimposed punctuation appears uncomfortable. Ruskin evidently had trouble writing commas and periods on the baseline, 
                                with the result that these marks float as if they were apostrophes or quotation marks. 
                                
                                In some cases, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> anchors these with an insertion caret 
                                (see <ref type="internal" target="#DELETIONANDADDITION">Deletion and Addition</ref>), 
                                as in <ref type="apparatus" target="on_the_rainbow_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="JRONTHERAINBOW">&#x201C;On the Rainbow&#x201D;</title></ref>.
                                In transcription, these floating marks are interpreted as conventional punctuation on the baseline.</p>
                            <p>In another idiosyncracy of punctuation, occurring throughout the early manuscripts and perhaps related to what <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName> 
                                has identified in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s mature hand as a <hi rend="italic">half&#x2010;comma</hi>, 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> inscribed what look like periods in the middle of sentences, 
                                where syntax calls for commas; and conversely, he wrote what look like commas as terminal punctuation at the end of sentences. 
                                This reversal, while not consistent, occurs regularly enough that the marks can be treated as glyphs. 
                                Thus, the mark is transcribed as the period or comma that its scribal appearance suggests, but the mark is tagged as a glyph, &#x0040;type &#x201C;terminal&#x2010;comma&#x201D; 
                                for what appears intended as terminal punctuation, 
                                and &#x0040;type &#x201C;pause&#x2010;period&#x201D; for what appears meant to indicate a pause, not a terminus.</p>
                            <p>As found likewise in letters written by all three members of the family, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> sometimes omits terminal punctuation and instead allows extra space 
                                between the end of one sentence and the start of the next. In these instances, the gap is encoded using the &#x3008;space&#x3009; element. 
                                However, if terminal punctuation is lacking, and no extra space is evident, we do not supply extra space where it does not exist, 
                                as <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> does in 
                                <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref> 
                                in order to aid the reader&#x02BC;s eye.</p>
                            <p>An especially puzzling terminal punctuation is identified as a glyph &#x0040;type &#x201C;double&#x2010;period&#x201D;, 
                                which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> forms as two horizontally adjacent points. The mark appears to emerge 
                                simultaneously with his adoption of pen and ink, and it is
                            </p>
                            <p>If random flourishes and other marks in a manuscript appear to serve only decorative or doodling purposes, and no purpose of punctuation can be discerned, 
                                they are ignored in transcription and markup, apart from a textual note atesting to their presence.</p>
                            
                       <!-- 
                        <p>In the earliest writing, Ruskin appears to have developed some  punctuation peculiar to himself—as obscure, 
                            in some instances, as his later mineralogical code symbols. In the first “Harry and Lucy” (no. 3), 
                            Ruskin ends sentences with a mark that might be a question mark or might be an exclamation point, 
                            and that seems to serve both of those functions. I have interpreted this mark similarly to my treatment of Ruskin’s comma and period reversal, 
                            using [?] for the mark when the sense calls for a question, and [!] for the mark in other cases.</p>
                        <p>As another system of his own in the earlier writing, especially in no. 3, Ruskin added closing quotation marks only to the ends of paragraphs, 
                            never paired with opening quotation marks. Not all the paragraphs with closing quotation marks are dialogue, 
                            and not all dialogue paragraphs have quotation marks. I suspect either that Ruskin misunderstood the symbol as indicating the end of a paragraph, 
                            or that he just liked the mark’s appearance. In either case, the mark would be best omitted altogether in transcription; 
                            however, I have retained it, since another reader might make better sense of it.</p>
                        <p>Still more bizarre is Ruskin’s doubled period, which he uses in the second “Harry and Lucy” (no. 20) and still more frequently in “Eudosia” (no. 27). 
                            The mark certainly does not indicate an emphatic stop; the opposite is more likely, a two-point ellipsis suggesting a slight pause, 
                            in the way a dash would normally be used. Ruskin may have needed to invent his own sign to function as a dash, 
                            since he used dashes and hyphens for another purpose, namely, to fill out and “justify” lines. 
                            In nos. 20 and 27, a bracketed dash [—] is used in place of Ruskin’s double period (..).

                                such as that marked up (using typographical symbols) in 
                                <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MELVILLEBILLYBUDD">Melville, <title type="book" corresp="#MELVILLEBILLYBUDD"><hi rend="italic">Billy Budd, Sailor</hi></title>, ed. Hayford and Sealts</ref> (pp. 270&#x2010;425), 
                                albeit limited to the genetic development of a single witness. (A genetic reconstruction of a work&#x02BC;s development using all available draft and fair&#x2010;copy witnesses 
                                is presented discursively in the work&#x02BC;s apparatus.) In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> Showcase, using the Transcription Toggle 
                                on the toolbar (the curved arrow), the reader can view at stage one (indicated on the toggle arrow by its first third being highlighted) 
                                the earliest textual state of a given witness, with text that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> later deleted appearing gray. 
                                At stage two (indicated on the toggle arrow by two&#x2010;thirds being highlighted), the reader views the second state of text, 
                                with the added text replacing the deletion. In stage three (indicated by the toggle arrow being fully highlighted), the reader views 
                                deletions and additions simultaneously&#x2014;that is, the final state of the manuscript witness, as it presently appears&#x2014;with additions appearing above, 
                                below, or overlapping with the (grayed&#x2010;out) deletions, as the case may be.</p>
                            <p>In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, addition and deletion is not marked up as a single act, using the substitution element (&#x3008;subst&#x3009;), 
                                except in cases of overwriting, which cannot be otherwise interpreted. In many instances of deletion followed immediately by a word 
                                that makes sense of the passage, or with such a word placed above or below the line, no other scenario than an immediate substitution seems probable&#x2014;particularly 
                                if the change is reflected in a subsequent fair copy. But we leave these inferences to the reader, relegating our own interpretations to a textual gloss or the apparatus.</p>
                            <p>In the earliest extant juvenilia, a form of erasure and substitution is to allow a mistaken character to stand (or to be erased imperfectly), 
                                but to follow that character with a heavily inscribed character, as if the latter were in boldface, in order to emphasize the substitution.

                                by his carrying out the transposition in a later fair copy of the poem. We encode <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s symbol for the point of insertion, 
                                an asterisk, with the element &#x3008;metamark&#x3009;, with its &#x0040;function designated in this case as &#x201C;insertion&#x201D;; and we encode the lines to be transposed, 
                                which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> brackets in the margin, as a span of text. This is a striking, early instance of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>

                            <p>All metamarks require an editorial gloss to confirm or speculate about their meaning. In general, it seems, the earlier a possible metamark, the more ambiguous its intention, 
                                and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> is more likely to use a word rather than a symbol. In <date when="1827">1827</date>,

                                could not be specified with certainty. That <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intended the word as metadiscourse seems evident in its isolation, placed on the same line 
                                as a runover text without its forming a part of that runover in sense or grammar. We can speculate that he intended this negative judgment as a directive to reject the poem's strophe 
                                and replace it with another that follows; however, in this and any such ambiguous instance, we can only encode the word or symbol as a &#x3008;metamark&#x3009; 
                                without confidently supplying a &#x0040;function or &#x0040;target. Rather, we can only discuss a possible function and target in a textual gloss and/or

                                    on another work or a corpus, inscribed directly on the manuscript witness of that work or corpus, and often written by some agent other than the author 
                                    of the original work or corpus. As works, these sorts of glosses are represented by their own apparatus and witness. An example is

                                    since these glosses supply necessary clarifications of editorial procedure and extensions of markup. They are further subdivided into two kinds:

                            <p>The editor's explanatory and textual glosses are localized to annotating transcripts of specific works, as compared with the form of commentary 
                                called <hi rend="italic">notes</hi>, which are free&#x2010;standing and hyperlinked throughout the archive.
                                (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="plan_of_archive_note.php">Plan of the Archive</ref>). As the term implies, 
                                explanatory glosses contextualize specific passages in a work&#x2014;too specific to be annotated with a &#x3008;note&#x3009; that would be 
                                accessible by hyperlink througout the edition. A textual gloss draws attention a specific textual or bibliographical feature of a witness.</p>
                            <p>Explanatory and textual glosses are accessed through clickable callouts embedded directly in the text. The callouts appear in a different color than 
                                that of the surrounding text; and explanatory gloss callouts are sequenced in arabic numerals, while textual gloss callouts are sequenced by lowercase letters.</p>
                            <p>While it is typically recommended in print editions that such annotations be referenced by line number in order to maintain a clear text, 
                                without the clutter of note callouts (see, e.g., 
                                <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#KLINEPERDUEDOCUMENTARY">Kline and Perdue, <hi rend="italic">Guide to Documentary Editing</hi></ref>, 117), 
                                two factors render embedded callouts more practical in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>. First, because the archive preserves the separate integrity of multiple witnesses 
                                of a work, a gloss must be capable of hyperlinking to the same or similar string of characters found in more than one witness, 
                                without regard to differences between witnesses in line numbering. Second, because the archive preserves the evidence of 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own line numbering, which he applied to some witnesses, annotation callouts need to work independently 
                                that numbering, which is often confused or erroneous.</p>
