                    that presumably took place in <date when="1826">1826</date> prior to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s composing his <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title>
                    narrative, although it is possible that the story refers to a previous season. Seaside resorts attracted the elder Ruskins 
                    from nearly <date when="1818">the start of their marriage</date>, probably for their salubriousness to health as well as for pleasure 
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="seaside_resorts_note.php"><placeName corresp="#SEASIDE">Seaside Resorts</placeName></ref>, and see also

                <p>The destinations of the Ruskin family tours of <date when="1826">1826</date> and <date when="1827">1827</date> were established by
                    <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> in <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (<date when="1891">1891</date>)</title></ref>; 
                    and while the dates of those tours were revised, and the destinations refined, by subsequent editors and biographers, the broad assumptions have not been
                    challenged. Those assumptions rest, however, on confusing evidence in the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title></ref>, 
                    and it may be that evidence referring apparently to two separate northern journeys, of <date when="1826">1826</date> and of <date when="1827">1827</date>, in fact refer
                    to a single tour of <date when="1827">1827</date>.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> took as his first point of reference the poems <ref type="apparatus" target="on_scotland_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRONSCOTLAND">&#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;</title></ref> 
                    in <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref>, 
                    and <ref type="apparatus" target="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRGLENOFGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;)</title></ref> 
                    in <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref>. 
                    The former, he declared, &#x201C;record[s <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s] impressions received during a journey from
                    <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> with his parents, after visiting his <persName corresp="#JRP">aunt</persName> at <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>&#x201D;
                    in <date when="1826">1826</date>. Specifically, he believed, the poem captured the return journey, given the poem&#x02BC;s trope of changes: one
                    line &#x201C;is no doubt a reminiscence of the <date when="1826-05">May</date> sunshine in which they went northwards; for their start was usually made about the middle of May; and
                    [<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>] contrasts the sunny anticipation of the arrival with the autumnal gloom of the departure&#x201D;
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, <date when="1891">1891</date>]</title></ref>,
                    1:xxii&#x2013;xxiii; <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS8D1891"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [8<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, <date when="1891">1891</date>]</title></ref>, 1:ix). On the
                    strength of this interpretation, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> renamed this poem <title type="poem" corresp="#JRONSCOTLAND">&#x201C;Farewell
                    to Scotland&#x201D;</title> (see <ref type="apparatus" target="on_scotland_apparatus.php#TITLE">&#x201C;To Scotland&#x201D;: Title</ref>).</p>
                <p>The latter portion of this interpretation, at the very least, has been disproved by <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName>, who points out
                    that, in <date when="1826-05">May 1826</date>, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> was on the road
                    beyond his <date when="1826-05-10">10 May</date> birthday, as attested by his dated letters to <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> extending through the end of the month.
                    Business had been lean that year, thus delaying a family holiday (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>,
                    137, 139 n. 1, 150 n. 5, 137).</p>
                <p>Moreover, further upsetting the family&#x02BC;s routine, in <date notBefore="1826-04" notAfter="1826-05">April and May 1826</date> they
                    coped with the consumptive decline and death of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> <persName corresp="#JRPSON">cousin</persName>,
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_james_note.php"><persName corresp="#JRPSON">James Richardson</persName></ref>, who had been living at

                    <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="ruskin_telford_note.php"><orgName corresp="#RUSKINETAL">Ruskin, Telford, and Domecq</orgName></ref>. 
                    By <date when="1826-04">April</date>, <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>&#x02BC;s health had declined so alarmingly that he returned to his family in 
                    <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>, possibly escorted on this journey by <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> and <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>. 
                    The youth died soon after his return, on <date when="1826-05-08">8 May</date>, a few days before <date when="1826-05-10"><persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s birthday</date>. 
                    When <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> learned of his <persName corresp="#JRPSON">nephew</persName>&#x02BC;s death, he was traveling in the northwest, and he did not return home until 
                    <date notBefore="1826-05-25" notAfter="1826-05-31">the end of May</date> at the earliest 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 139 n. 1, 149; see also

                <p><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> states that &#x201C;in <date when="1826-04">April</date> the Ruskins took . . . <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName> 
                    back to <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>,&#x201D; an inference that he presumably takes from <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="mr_to_jjr_1826-05-07_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="mr_to_jjr_1826-05-08">letter</title> of <date notBefore="1826-05-07" notAfter="1826-05-08">7&#x2013;8 May</date></ref>, in which she reflects on <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    &#x201C;journey up&#x201D;. <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> is reminding her husband that, on this journey, 
                    <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName> &#x201C;had none of that spirit which youths of his age usually have&#x201D;, so that 
                    &#x201C;both you &#x0026; I had repeatedly asked him if he was quite sure he was happy and . . . he had assured us in the strongest terms he was&#x201D;. 
                    While <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s comments leave some doubt about who made the trip with <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>, 
                    it seems unlikely that, even if both the elder Ruskins undertook this sad journey to <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>, 
                    they would have risked bringing <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>. Considering that <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> 
                    warned <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>&#x02BC;s mother, <persName corresp="#JRP">Jessie Richardson</persName>, 
                    &#x201C;that the children should not be much with . . . [<persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>] for fear
                    of infection&#x201D; (referring to his brothers and sisters), it seems strange that she would have exposed her own <persName corresp="#JR">son</persName> 
                    during a long journey. <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> would also have stood a good chance of having to witness 
                    <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>&#x02BC;s death, since <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> believed that 
                    &#x201C;worlds could not save him&#x201D;. She concluded this much &#x201C;when <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>
                    was at <placeName corresp="#CROYDON">Croydon</placeName>&#x201D;, referring to the house of her sister, <persName corresp="#BR">Bridget Richardson</persName>. 
                    Thus, perhaps <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> was left with his <placeName corresp="#CROYDON">Croydon</placeName> aunt, uncle, and cousins, while his parents 
                    carried <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName> to <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> 
                    (<!--Tagged letter twice (at beginning of paragraph and here at the end), as it is referred to many times --><ref type="apparatus" target="mr_to_jjr_1826-05-07_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="mr_to_jjr_1826-05-08">letter of <date when="1826-05-08">8 May 1826</date></title></ref> [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 134 n. 3, 142]).</p>
                <p>Did <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s fears prevent the family from journeying north in <date when="1826">1826</date> altogether, even later in the year? 
                    While <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> corrects <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s assumption that the Scottish journey occurred in <date when="1826-05">May</date>,
                    he relies on the same evidence as does <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> to affirm that &#x201C;the family probably went in <date when="1826-09">September&#x201D; 1826</date>

                    Both conclusions go back to the evidence of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, <ref type="apparatus" target="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRGLENOFGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;)</title></ref>, 
                    and to <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s belief that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote it, like <ref type="apparatus" target="on_scotland_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRONSCOTLAND">&#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;</title></ref>, either

                <p>All of this is to say that some skepticism is warranted about the dates and destinations of the Ruskin family&#x02BC;s earlier tours, evidence for which has,

                    even supposing that <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s remark to his <persName corresp="#MR">wife</persName> about &#x201C;our delightful Journey together&#x201D; 
                    does refer to a northern journey in <date when="1826-09">September 1826</date>&#x2014;for which there is slender and ambiguous evidence&#x2014;on what evidence would we conclude that this journey included the <geogName corresp="#LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</geogName> as well as <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>?</p>

                   <p>According to the prose account of the journey in <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol2_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL2">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        the itinerary took the Ruskins first to <placeName corresp="#SALTHILL">Salt Hill</placeName>, a major stage west of <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, opening to the <placeName corresp="#GWR">Great West Road</placeName>; 
                       however, rather than heading west toward <placeName corresp="#BRISTOL">Bristol</placeName>, 
                        the Ruskins turned northwest to <placeName corresp="#OXFORD">Oxford</placeName>, 
                        where they stayed briefly to view the colleges. They proceeded through <placeName corresp="#GLOUCESTER">Gloucester</placeName>, presumably on a straight path to <placeName corresp="#ROSSONWYE">Ross&#x2010;on&#x2010;Wye</placeName>, 
                        an established launching place for a tour of the <geogName corresp="#WYE">Wye Valley</geogName>, but 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s account next mentions <placeName corresp="#MONMOUTH">Monmouth</placeName>. It is not clear, therefore, whether the prose account accurately describes the sequence of the itinerary. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> describes <placeName corresp="#TINTERN">Tintern Abbey</placeName> at length, followed by a reference to <placeName corresp="#WINDCLIFF">Windcliff</placeName>&#x2013;one of the eminences surrounding the dramatic bend in the river that 
                        encloses the peninsula of <placeName corresp="#LANCAUT">Lancaut</placeName>&#x2013;but the narrative neglects to mention <placeName corresp="#RAGLAN">Raglan Castle</placeName>, which figures prominently as the subject of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem 
                       in <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201c;Poetry Discriptive&#x201d;</title></ref>. 
                        Thus, it seems likely that the travel narrative and poetry anthology are governed less by concerns for accuracy, like a memoir, 
                        than by the high points of picturesque viewing (indeed, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title> purports to be a fictionalized lesson in the manner the <title type="book" corresp="#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED">Edgeworths&#x02BC; series of lessons</title>,

                       <placeName corresp="#WINDCLIFF">Windcliff</placeName>, for example, was known primarily as a picturesque spot&#x2013;one 
                        of the elevated views over the river from the <placeName type="building" corresp="#PIERCEFIELDHOUSE">Piercefield estate</placeName>, 
                        famous for its picturesque walks developed during the age of <persName corresp="#CAPABILITY">Capability Brown</persName> (<date notBefore="1716" notAfter="1783">1716&#x2013;83</date>)

                    <p>Wearied with another challenging year for his business, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> perhaps welcomed an excursion through the 
                        <geogName corresp="#WYE">Wye Valley</geogName> which offered provisions for easy travel 
                        that had been honed to commercial efficiency by three&#x2010;quarters of a century of popular picturesque viewing. 
                        From the <date notBefore="1760" notAfter="1800">1760s through the turn of the century</date>, the preferred modes for experiencing the dramatic features 
                        along the craggy banks of the river were by water or by foot 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ANDREWSPICTURESQUE"><persName corresp="#MANDREWS">Andrews</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#ANDREWSSEARCHFORTHEPICTURESQUE"><hi rend="italic">Search for the Picturesque</hi></title>, 84&#x2013;107</ref>). 
                        By the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, however, the Ruskins would have benefited from easier carriage access 
                        owing to road improvements, including a new turnpike from <placeName corresp="#CHEPSTOW">Chepstow</placeName> and a carriageway from <placeName corresp="#MONMOUTH">Monmouth</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#RAGLAN">Raglan Castle</placeName>; 
                        and in the year of their journey, the Ruskins could have observed an industrial&#x2010;age iron bridge under construction at <placeName corresp="#BIGSWEIR">Bigsweir</placeName>, 
                        midway between <placeName corresp="#TINTERN">Tintern</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#MONMOUTH">Monmouth</placeName>. If they left their carriage for a water excursion, 
                        they could have embarked on one of the steam packets that had been operating throughout the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>

                        the family took the length of the <geogName corresp="#WYE">Wye Valley</geogName> excursion at least from <placeName corresp="#MONMOUTH">Monmouth</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#TINTERN">Tintern Abbey</placeName> 
                        (the tour normally departing from <placeName corresp="#ROSSONWYE">Ross&#x2010;on&#x2010;Wye</placeName> and ending at <placeName corresp="#CHEPSTOW">Chepstow</placeName>). 
                        At <placeName corresp="#MONMOUTH">Monmouth</placeName>, a short ride would have brought the visitors to <placeName rend="italic" corresp="#RAGLAN">Raglan Castle</placeName>, 
                        prompting <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <ref type="apparatus" target="ragland_castle_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRRAGLANDCASTLE">poem</title> of that name</ref>.

                        showing open water crowded with both large ships under full sail and smoking steamboats, so it appears likely that the Ruskins continued 
                        to <placeName corresp="#CHEPSTOW">Chepstow</placeName> and even beyond into the <geogName corresp="#BRISTOLCHANNEL">Bristol Channel</geogName>.</p>
                    <p>To guide them on the <geogName corresp="#WYE">Wye</geogName> tour, the Ruskins are likely to have used an edition of the guidebook,

                        Not only were these guidebooks popular and widely available, but there is also evidence of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s close attention to <persName corresp="#CTH">Heath</persName>&#x02BC;s
