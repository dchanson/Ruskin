                <p>According to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;, Vol. 1</title></ref>, 
                    the family holidayed in <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName>, a journey from <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#SUSSEX">Sussex</placeName>
                    that presumably took place in <date when="1826">1826</date> prior to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s composing his <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title>
                    narrative, although it is possible that the story refers to a previous season. Seaside resorts attracted the Ruskins 
                    from nearly <date when="1818">the start of their marriage</date>, probably for their salubriousness to health as well as for pleasure 
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="seaside_resorts_note.php"><placeName corresp="#SEASIDE">Seaside Resorts</placeName></ref>, and see also

                <p>The destinations of the Ruskin family tours of <date when="1826">1826</date> and <date when="1827">1827</date> were established by
                    <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> in <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (<date when="1891">1891</date>)</title></ref>; 
                    and while the dates of those tours were revised, and the destinations refined, by subsequent editors and biographers, the broad assumptions have not been
                    challenged. Those assumptions rest, however, on possibly confusing evidence in the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title></ref>, 
                    and it may be that evidence referring apparently to two separate northern journeys, of <date when="1826">1826</date> and of <date when="1827">1827</date>, in fact refer
                    to a single tour of <date when="1827">1827</date>.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> took as his first point of reference the poems <ref type="apparatus" target="on_scotland_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRONSCOTLAND">&#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;</title></ref>
                    and <ref type="apparatus" target="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRGLENOFGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;)</title></ref>. 
                    The former, he declared, &#x201C;record[s <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s] impressions received during a journey from
                    <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> with his parents, after visiting his <persName corresp="#JRP">aunt</persName> at <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>&#x201D;
                    in <date when="1826">1826</date>. Specifically, he believed, the poem captured the return journey, given the poem&#x02BC;s trope of changes: one
                    line &#x201C;is no doubt a reminiscence of the <date when="1826-05">May</date> sunshine in which they went northwards; for their start was usually made about the middle of May; and
                    [<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>] contrasts the sunny anticipation of the arrival with the autumnal gloom of the departure&#x201D;
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, <date when="1891">1891</date>]</title></ref>,
                    1:xxii&#x2013;xxiii; <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS8D1891"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [8<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, <date when="1891">1891</date>]</title></ref>, 1:ix). On the
                    strength of this interpretation, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> renamed this poem <title type="poem" corresp="#JRONSCOTLAND">&#x201C;Farewell
                    to Scotland&#x201D;</title> (see <ref type="apparatus" target="on_scotland_apparatus.php#TITLE">&#x201C;To Scotland&#x201D;: Title</ref>).</p>
                <p>The latter portion of this interpretation, at the very least, has been disproved by <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName>, who points out
                    that, in <date when="1826-05">May 1826</date>, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> was on the road
                    beyond his <date when="1826-05-10">10 May</date> birthday, as attested by his dated letters to <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> extending through the end of the month.
                    Business had been lean that year, thus delaying a family holiday (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>,
                    137, 139 n. 1, 150 n. 5, 137).</p>
                <p>Moreover, further upsetting the family&#x02BC;s routine, in <date notBefore="1826-04" notAfter="1826-05">April and May</date> they
                    coped with the consumptive decline and death of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> <persName corresp="#JRPSON">cousin</persName>,
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_james_note.php"><persName corresp="#JRPSON">James Richardson</persName></ref>, who had been living at
                    <ref type="note" subtype="geographical" target="herne_hill_note.php"><placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName></ref> while working at
                    <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="ruskin_telford_note.php"><orgName corresp="#RUSKINETAL">Ruskin, Telford, and Domecq</orgName></ref>. 
                    By <date when="1826-04">April</date>, <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>&#x02BC;s health had declined so alarmingly that he returned to his family in 
                    <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>, possibly escorted on this journey by <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> and <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>. 
                    The youth died soon after his return, on <date when="1826-05-08">8 May</date>, a few days before <date when="1826-05-10"><persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s birthday</date>. 
                    When <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> learned of his <persName corresp="#JRPSON">nephew</persName>&#x02BC;s death, he was traveling in the northwest, and he did not return home until 
                    <date notBefore="1826-05-25" notAfter="1826-05-31">the end of May</date> at the earliest 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 139 n. 1, 149; see also 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_james_note.php"><persName corresp="#JRPSON">James Richardson [<date notBefore="1808" notAfter="1826">1808&#x2013;26</date>]</persName></ref>).</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> states that &#x201C;in <date when="1826-04">April</date> the Ruskins took . . . <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName> 
                    back to <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>,&#x201D; an inference that he presumably takes from <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    letter of <date notBefore="1826-05-07" notAfter="1826-05-08">7&#x2013;8 May</date>, in which she reflects on <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    &#x201C;journey up.&#x201D; <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> is reminding her husband that, on this journey, 
                    <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName> &#x201C;had none of that spirit which youths of his age usually have,&#x201D; so that 
                    &#x201C;both you &#x0026; I had repeatedly asked him if he was quite sure he was happy and . . . he had assured us in the strongest terms he was.&#x201D; 
                    <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s references are somewhat obscure; however, assuming that the elder Ruskins did make this journey 
                    to <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> along with <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>, would they have allowed <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> 
                    to come along? Considering that <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> admonished the boy&#x02BC;s mother, <persName corresp="#JRP">Jessie Richardson</persName>, 
                    &#x201C;that the children should not be much with . . . [<persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>] for fear
                    of infection&#x201D; (referring to his brothers and sisters), it seems unlikely that <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> would have risked exposing 
                    her own <persName corresp="#JR">son</persName>. It seems equally unlikely that she would have wanted her <persName corresp="#JR">son</persName> to remain close at hand where he might witness <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>&#x02BC;s death, 
                    since she felt &#x201C;next to convinced that worlds could not save him&#x201D;. She observed this &#x201C;when <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>
                    was at <placeName corresp="#CROYDON">Croydon</placeName>,&#x201D; doubtless referring to the house of her sister, <persName corresp="#BR">Bridget Richardson</persName>. 
                    Thus, perhaps <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> was left with his <placeName corresp="#CROYDON">Croydon</placeName> aunt, uncle, and cousins, while his parents 
                    carried <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName> to <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 134 n. 3, 142).</p>
                <p>Did <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s fears prevent the family from journeying north in <date when="1826">1826</date> altogether, even later in the year? 
                    While <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> corrects <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s assumption that the Scottish journey occurred in <date when="1826-05">May</date>,
                    he relies on the same evidence as does <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> to affirm that &#x201C;the family probably went in <date when="1826-09">September&#x201D; 1826</date> 
                    to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 150 n. 5).
                    Both conclusions go back to the evidence of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, <ref type="apparatus" target="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRGLENOFGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;)</title></ref>, 
                    and to <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s belief that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote it, like <ref type="apparatus" target="on_scotland_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRONSCOTLAND">&#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;</title></ref>, either 
                    &#x201C;during the journey home&#x201D; from a <date notBefore="1826-03-20" notAfter="1826-06-21">spring</date> tour to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> (which
                    certainly did not occur), &#x201C;or on his return [to <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>], in <date when="1826-09">September</date>&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, <date when="1891">1891</date>]</title></ref>, 1:xxiii;

                <p>The <date when="1826-09">September</date> date comes originally, as <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> remarks, from an annotation by <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> in <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref> attributing
                   <title type="poem" corresp="#JRGLENOFGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;)</title> to that month (<persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, like <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>, attributes the gloss to
                    <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>, but the hand is <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s). It is
                    possible that a <date when="1826-09">September</date> journey resulted not only in this poem but also in the entirety of <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref>

                    which contains <title type="poem" corresp="#JRONSCOTLAND">&#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;</title>), since <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> noted her <persName corresp="#JR">son</persName> as having started 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref> at about that time, in <date notBefore="1826-09" notAfter="1826-10">September or October 1826</date>

                    journey to that region in that year.</p>
                <p>In the introduction to <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#TOURLAKES"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> and <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName>, eds., <title type="essay" corresp="#TOURLAKESINTRO"><hi rend="italic">Tour of the Lakes</hi></title></ref>,
                    <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> rehearses the same set of poems not only as evidence for an <date when="1826">1826</date> <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> journey, but also 
                    a visit to the <geogName corresp="#LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</geogName> annexed to the same trip (&#x201C;by way of <placeName corresp="#CONISTON">Coniston</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#KESWICK">Keswick</placeName>&#x201D;)
                    on the evidence of <ref type="apparatus" target="on_skiddaw_and_derwentwater_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwentwater&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                    That poem, however, as <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> himself points out, was misdated as <date when="1828">1828</date> by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s earlier editors, belonging in fact to
                    <date when="1829">1829</date>. The poem proves nothing, therefore, about the case for an <date when="1826">1826</date> northern tour;
                    nor does the remark <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> quotes by <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> in a <date when="1827-02-21">21 February 1827</date> letter to

                    assumes&#x2014;but merely to the <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName> visit indicated in <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</title> 
                    (although the remark does seem to refer to a journey taken in the previous year, <date when="1826">1826</date>;

                <p>All of this is to say that some skepticism is warranted about the dates and destinations of the Ruskin family&#x02BC;s earlier tours, evidence for which has, 
                    for more than a century, turned on the dating of a few poems. Ultimately, the case hinges on <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s gloss of

                    as <date when="1826-09">September 1826</date>, and we cannot know precisely what she intended by that date. We also lack firm evidence about the itinerary: 
                    if <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s remark to his <persName corresp="#MR">wife</persName> about &#x201C;our delightful Journey together&#x201D; 
                    does refer to a northern journey in <date when="1826-09">September 1826</date>&#x2014;and, writing in <date when="1827-02">February 1827</date>,
                    he does seem to imply a recent journey&#x2014;on what evidence do we conclude that this journey included the <geogName corresp="#LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</geogName>?</p>

                        indicating that the itinerary was already planned.</p>
                   <p>According to the prose account of the journey in <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol2_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL2">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 2</title></ref>, 
                        the itinerary took the Ruskins first to <placeName corresp="#SALTHILL">Salt Hill</placeName>, a major stage west of <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, opening to the <placeName corresp="#GWR">Great West Road</placeName>; 
                       however, rather than heading west toward <placeName corresp="#BRISTOL">Bristol</placeName>, 
                        the Ruskins turned northwest to <placeName corresp="#OXFORD">Oxford</placeName>, 
                        where they stayed briefly to view the colleges. They proceeded through <placeName corresp="#GLOUCESTER">Gloucester</placeName>, presumably on a straight path to <placeName corresp="#ROSSONWYE">Ross&#x2010;on&#x2010;Wye</placeName>, 
                        an established launching place for a tour of the <geogName corresp="#WYE">Wye Valley</geogName>, but 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s account next mentions <placeName corresp="#MONMOUTH">Monmouth</placeName>. It is not clear, therefore, whether the prose account accurately describes the sequence of the itinerary. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> describes <placeName corresp="#TINTERN">Tintern Abbey</placeName> at length, followed by a reference to <placeName corresp="#WINDCLIFF">Windcliff</placeName>&#x2013;one of the eminences surrounding the dramatic bend in the river that 
                        encloses the peninsula of <placeName corresp="#LANCAUT">Lancaut</placeName>&#x2013;but the narrative neglects to mention <placeName corresp="#RAGLAN">Raglan Castle</placeName>, which figures prominently as the subject of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem

                        Thus, it seems likely that the travel narrative and poetry anthology are governed less by concerns for accuracy, like a memoir, 
                        than by the high points of picturesque viewing (indeed, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title> purports to be a fictionalized lesson in the manner the <title type="book" corresp="#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED">Edgeworths&#x02BC; series of lessons</title>,

                        owing to road improvements, including a new turnpike from <placeName corresp="#CHEPSTOW">Chepstow</placeName> and a carriageway from <placeName corresp="#MONMOUTH">Monmouth</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#RAGLAN">Raglan Castle</placeName>; 
                        and in the year of their journey, the Ruskins could have observed an industrial&#x2010;age iron bridge under construction at <placeName corresp="#BIGSWEIR">Bigsweir</placeName>, 
                        midway between <placeName corresp="#TINTERN">Tintern</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#MONMOUTH">Monmouth</placeName>. If they left their carriage for a water excursion, 
                        they could have embarked on one of the steam packets that had been operating throughout the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>

                        the family took the length of the <geogName corresp="#WYE">Wye Valley</geogName> excursion at least from <placeName corresp="#MONMOUTH">Monmouth</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#TINTERN">Tintern Abbey</placeName> 
                        (the tour normally departing from <placeName corresp="#ROSSONWYE">Ross&#x2010;on&#x2010;Wye</placeName> and ending at <placeName corresp="#CHEPSTOW">Chepstow</placeName>). 
                        At <placeName corresp="#MONMOUTH">Monmouth</placeName>, a short ride would have brought the visitors to <placeName rend="italic" corresp="#RAGLAN">Raglan Castle</placeName>,

                        showing open water crowded with both large ships under full sail and smoking steamboats, so it appears likely that the Ruskins continued

                    <p>To guide them on the <geogName corresp="#WYE">Wye</geogName> tour, the Ruskins are likely to have used an edition of the guidebook,

                        by the <placeName corresp="#MONMOUTH">Monmouth</placeName> printer, <persName corresp="#CTH">Charles Heath</persName> (<date notBefore="1761" notAfter="1830">1761&#x2013;1830</date>), 
                        and possibly also his <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HEATHTINTERN"><title type="book" rend="italic" corresp="#HEATHTINTERN">Historical and Descriptive Accounts of the Ancient and Present State of <placeName corresp="#TINTERN">Tintern Abbey</placeName></title></ref>. 
                        Not only were these guidebooks popular and widely available, but there is also evidence of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s close attention to <persName corresp="#CTH">Heath</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        approach to interpreting the castle and abbey ruins. A drawing in

                        &#x201C;The Castle in Its Present State, as It Is Now Shewn&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Castle in Its Splendor&#x201D;&#x2014;the latter 
                        reconstructing the castle&#x02BC;s past state, &#x201C;when newly built,&#x201D; as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> puts it.

               without explaining how the Ruskins traveled there from <placeName corresp="#WALES">Wales</placeName>&#x2014;except, &#x201C;<persName type="fictional_person">Harry</persName>&#x201D; says, that they went by sea on a steamboat. 
               Unless the sea voyage is entirely fanciful, this crossing or coastal sailing 
                        presumably occurred on the eastern side of <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> omitting an account of the northeastern journey from <placeName corresp="#WALES">Wales</placeName>. 
               This leg of the tour would have presented an opportunity 
                        to visit some portion of the <geogName corresp="#LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</geogName> before heading east to the opposite coast.</p>

                        and they continued south along the <placeName corresp="#GNR">Great North Road</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#HADDINGTON">Haddington</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#BERWICK">Berwick&#x2010;upon&#x2010;Tweed</placeName>,
