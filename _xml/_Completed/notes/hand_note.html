                    for copperplate&#x201D;, imitating his <span class="persName-JJR">father</span>&#x02BC;s mercantile round hand with the aid of a copybook

                    Seemingly the most untenable assumption in <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s account is the exclusion of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s mother from any role in his developing handwriting, 
                    by limiting the story to the boy&#x02BC;s precocity and his father&#x02BC;s masculine mercantile discipline. 
                    Who else but <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> presided over the scenes of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s first handwriting

                  <div class="p">But the <span class="persName-fictional-OLDMANTD">old man</span>, as he was something of a scholar, had a great ambition that his darling
                                    should learn to read and write: and this was a work of some difficulty; for he had neither 
                                    printed book, nor pens, nor paper, in his cabin. Industry, however, enables us to overcome difficulties: 
                                    in the summer&#x2010;time, as the <span class="persName-fictional-OLDMANTD">old man</span> sat before his cottage, he would draw letters in the sand, 
                                    and teach <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</span> to name them singly, until he was acquainted with the whole alphabet. 
                                    He then proceeded to syllables, and after that to words; all which his little pupil learned 
                                    to pronounce with great facility: and, as he had a strong propensity to imitate what he saw, 
                                    he not only acquired the power of reading words, but of tracing all the letters 
                                    which composed them on the sand.</div>

            <div class="p">In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s copy of the book, the outlines of the woodcuts testify to his sharing <span class="persName-fictional-LITTLEJACKTD">Little Jack</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;strong propensity to imitate what he saw&#x201D;, while scattered, penciled words in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s hand on a flyleaf 
                        may be artifacts of his &#x201C;learn&#x005B;ing&#x005D; himself to write&#x201D; by imitation, as well. (Some of the barely legible, smeared words&#x2014;<i>arrived</i>, <i>preserve</i>&#x2014;can be found in the printed text.) 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> can scarcely have relied solely on himself, however, for the <span class="persName-fictional-OLDMANTD">old man</span>&#x02BC;s method of progressing from alphabet to syllables to words. 
                        Words written in ink apparently by both <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> and <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> are found in this book as well, attesting to their guidance. 
                        From 1827, probably at least two years after the undated tracings in Little Jack, 
                        the rear endpaper of MS III contains, in Ruskin's hand, a scattering of characters, especially the letters m and n; 
                        and alongside these, in a parent's hand, appear demonstrations of both lettering and spelling: 
                        for example, Ruskin attempts a Scottish place-name, which he spells "canoul", and a parent corrects to "Kinnoul" in pencil print lettering.

            <div class="p">Sometime prior to this practice by imitation, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was already able to print his name in pencil.

                        and allowed ample interlinear space&#x2014;the line spacing owing in part to his following the pre&#x2010;ruled lines in the stationer&#x02BC;s notebooks known in the family as the &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/red_book_note" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;. 
                        The model for his large (and, by <span class="date-1826">1826</span>, well&#x2010;formed) lettering probably lay in the typography of his books&#x2014;not in a handwriting copybook, which <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> acquired for him in <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, but which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> appears not to have used immediately 
                        (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#HANSONMATERIALITY" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-DCH">Hanson</span>, <span class="title-essay-HANSONMATERIALITY">&#x201C;Materiality in John Ruskin&#x02BC;s Early Letters and Dialogues&#x201D;</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 15&#x2013;17). 
                        In the <span class="date-1767-1834">late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries</span>, a precedent for typography in children&#x02BC;s books had been set by 
                        &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/barbauld_anna_laetitia_note" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-ALB">Anna Letitia Barbauld</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;&#x02BC;s

                        in which she advocated for printing children&#x02BC;s books in large font size, along with generous allowance of white space on the page, 
                        in order to make print accessible and legible to a child&#x02BC;s eyes. As <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span> explains in the preface, 
                        a &#x201C;great defect&#x201D; she found in books commonly produced for children was &#x201C;the want of <i>good paper, a clear and large type</i>, 
                        and <i>large spaces</i>. They only, who have actually taught young children, can be sensible how necessary 
                        these assistances are&#x201D; (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#BARBAULDLESSONS" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>, <span class="title-book-BARBAULDLESSONS"><i>Lessons for Children</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 3&#x2013;4; and see &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#MCCARTHYBARBAULDLESSONS" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-WMCCARTHY">McCarthy</span>, <span class="title-essay-MCCARTHYBARBAULDLESSONS">&#x201C;Mother of All Discourses&#x201D;</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 200&#x2013;201). 
                        It is not known if <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was exposed to <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-BARBAULDLESSONS"><i>Lessons</i></span>, which <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> like countless mothers may have used to teach him to read when very young 
                        (its four parts were intended for children aged two to four), but he certainly was familiar with <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>&#x02BC;s 
                        <span class="title-book-BARBAULDHYMNSINPROSE"><i>Hymns in Prose</i></span>, which, in the Ruskins&#x02BC; <span class="date-1821">1821</span> edition published as a share&#x2010;book 
                        by Baldwin Cradock &#x0026; Joy and others, used type only slightly closer than the generous size still being reserved for those publishers&#x02BC; edition of

                        (a type possibly not as large and spacious, however, as that used for the original editions of <span class="title-book-BARBAULDLESSONS"><i>Lessons</i></span> published by <span class="persName-JJPUBLISHER">Joseph Johnson</span>).

            <div class="p">At the same time, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s early pencil print lettering already shows signs of being modeled on favorite books that were not intended for small children. For example, in 
                        &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I&#x201D;</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;,

                        he imitated the &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/edgeworth_harry_and_lucy_concluded_note" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;original&#x02BC;s title page&#x003C;/a&#x003E;; and in the text, he may have modeled his letters on the serif typeface used for <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s 
                        books, even adopting a decorative capital <i>Y</i> from the display type of the title page. 
                        (The lettering suggests Caslon or perhaps the English transitional serif typefaces, such as Baskerville and Bulmer, 
                        which predominated in British books of the <span class="date-1767-1834">late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries</span>.) Another influential model was the <span class="title-series-DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">&#x201C;Dove&#x02BC;s English Classics&#x201D;</span>, 
                        a reprint series of which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> owned volumes of <span class="persName-APOPE">Pope</span>&#x02BC;s translation of the <span class="title-poem-HOMERILIAD"><i>Iliad</i></span> (<span class="date-1824">1824</span>) 
                        and of <span class="persName-JDRYDEN">Dryden</span>&#x02BC;s translation of the <span class="title-poem-VIRGILAENEID"><i>Aeneid</i></span> and other works by <span class="persName-VIRGIL">Virgil</span> (<span class="date-1825">1825</span>). 
                        At three by five inches, much smaller than the <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span> volumes, 
                        the <span class="title-series-DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">&#x201C;Dove&#x02BC;s English Classics&#x201D;</span> were comparable in size to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/red_book_note" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 
                        but typographically the text was the opposite of <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>&#x02BC;s child&#x2010;friendly large and spacious type. 
                        The densely set lines of verse on small pages resulted in many runovers, which the printer/publisher J. F. Dove signaled with a right&#x2010;facing square bracket <i>&#x005B;</i>, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> precisely imitated 
                        when his own poems crowded the margins of his &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/red_book_note" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-manuscript-JRREDBOOK">Red Books</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E; 
                        (see &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/boyhood_books_note#DESCRIPTIONS" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Physical Descriptions&#x003C;/a&#x003E;;

            <div class="p">As a creative solution to problems occasioned  
                        by modeling his lettering on printed books, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> invented a punctuation mark enabling him to imitate a text block, justified right and left. 
                        Because he encountered difficulty in managing his letter&#x2010; and word&#x2010;spacing so as to end a line of prose squarely on the right&#x2010;justified margin, 
                        he filled in the gap with a variable&#x2010;length hyphen. Presumably, he based his mark on hyphenation used in print to divide words at the margin, 
                        and he did also employ the hyphen for that purpose. More often, however, he adapted the hyphen to his own use as an original punctuation mark, which he varied in length in order to justify his right margins. 
                        In <i>ERM</i>, the mark is designated as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <i>justification mark</i> 
                        (see &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/editorial_rationale_note#JUSTIFICATION" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology: Element, Attribute, and Value Usage&#x2014;Justification, Runover, and Word Division&#x003C;/a&#x003E;). 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> continued to use this mark for the purpose of right&#x2010;justifying text at least through <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy of 
                        <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">An Account of a Tour of the Continent</span> (<span class="date-1834">1834</span>.</div>
            
            
            <div class="p">As another typographic imitation in his print lettering, which must have been particularly obsessive and time&#x2010;consuming, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> ornamented his sentences with decorative capitals that he called &#x201C;double&#x201D; print. 
                        This was formed with a doubled downward or upward stroke, which could be left open or filled wtih shadow. 
                        Examples occur in the earliest fair&#x2010;copy manuscripts, both in the &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/red_book_note" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;Red Books&#x003C;/a&#x003E; and in the separate

                        (see, e.g., the <span class="date-1827-01-01">1 January 1827</span> pencil presentation copy, &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"&#x003C;?php echo r_build_url("witnesses/time_blank_verse_msia.php");?&#x003E;" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-poem-JRTIMEBLANKVERSE">&#x201C;Papa whats time a figure or a sense&#x201D;</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;). 
                        Possible models for the &#x201C;double&#x2010;lettering&#x201D; include a display typeface used on title pages of <span class="title-series-DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">&#x201C;Dove&#x02BC;s English Classics&#x201D;</span> 
                        and a similar engraved lettering used on maps in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s geography book, 
                        <span class="title-book-GOLDSMITHGEOGRAPHY"><i>Geography Illustrated on a Popular Plan</i></span> (<span class="date-1820">1820</span>) by the <span class="persName-RJG">Reverend J. Goldsmith</span> (the 
                        author also of a geography text used by the Brontës;

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> appears to have derived his double&#x2010;lettering primarily from a serif model, 
                        but he may also have based it on the sanserif typefaces that began as a neoclassical revival in the <span class="date-1780-1789">1780s</span> 
                        and sprang into a variety of forms and associations in the first decades of the nineteenth century 
                        (see &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#CRAMSIEGRAPHIC" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-PCRAMSIE">Cramsie</span>, <span class="title-book-CRAMSIEGRAPHIC"><i>Story of Graphic Design</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 117&#x2013;18, 126&#x2013;27). 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> used these decorative printed letter forms until <span class="date-1828-1829">1828&#x2013;29</span>, when his lettering for many texts 
                        became notably smaller, though no less typographical in form&#x2014;the decrease in size perhaps owing to his increasing agility with pen and ink, which he was using by then, but perhaps also to imitate the smaller type in the adult books 
                        he was consuming by then.</div>
            
            
            <div class="p">Double&#x2010;print lettering cost <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> a great deal of time and attention, as in the elaborate fair copy of the poem

                        focused on &#x201C;form&#x201D; and the &#x201C;purely visual properties&#x201D; of handwriting, thus requiring the student &#x201C;to learn 
                        how to represent the words of others&#x201D; in &#x201C;a variety of scripts&#x201D;&#x2014;and the ultimate purpose of writing instruction,

                        From the perspective of the nineteenth&#x2010;century child writer, however, what seems a deflection into materiality may have seemed a source of empowerment.

                            a layer of revisions written over top of the first fair copy appear to have been composed initially in pencil and then overwritten in ink. 
                            For the second fair copy of this poem, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> incorporated these revisions, fair&#x2010;copying the poem in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> using ink for print lettering, but with no sign of tracing over pencil lettering.</div>
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> probably learned to write in ink using a quill, if trade statistics for the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> 
                            provide a reliable guide. In <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> alone, imported goose quills consumed annually averaged around 20 million, 
                            and the country as a whole used about double that number. However, the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span> 
                            also witnessed the mass production of steel pens&#x2014;referring to what nowadays is typically called the <i>nib</i>, as opposed to the pen&#x2010;holder held in the hand&#x2014;and by <span class="date-1838">1838</span> this output increased to 220 million. In the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>, 
                            manufacturers (chiefly in <span class="placeName-BIRMINGHAM">Birmingham</span>) were improving the flexibility of pens as well producing them in quantities sufficient to lower their retail cost considerably. 
                            Even fountain&#x2010;pens were being patented, although not mass&#x2010;produced until the end of the century. These alternatives to the traditional quill became more affordable and widely used in the 
                            <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. Quills of any kind were purchased already prepared or &#x201C;dressed&#x201D;; and as the huge consumption suggests, 
                            consumers typically were unskilled in mending a quill for extended use, or unwilling to take the trouble, 
                            preferring merely to discard a dull pen for a fresh one. Steel pens broke easily, but as they became cheaper (dropping from about eighteen shillings per dozen at the start of the century 
                            to about fourpence per gross by <span class="date-1838">1838</span>), these too could be painlessly discarded by the middle&#x2010;class writer

               <div class="p">Prior to adoption of pen and ink, Ruskin's use of punctuation was limited to terminal punctuation in prose--periods, question marks, 
                            and sporadic quotation marks--while he rarely applied even periods to verse, typically presenting fair-copied poems devoid of punctuation. 
                            Whether by coincidence or spurred by the pleasure of fair-copying in ink, he began adding internal punctuation to both prose and verse works 
                            of 1827-28. In some works, such as book 4 of "The Monastery" and the first fair copy of "The Constellations", 
                            the manuscripts give the appearance that Ruskin added this liberal punctuation to the fair-copied text all at once, as an overlay atop the previously fair-copied lettering 
                            (see --the 
                            crowded and superfluous marks starting up or shutting down in a work, as if Ruskin was suddenly stirred to the task and then just as abruptly bored or distracted.  
                            Grammatically and rhetorically, the superimposed punctuation often appears to have perfunctory or even contradictory relation to the text, 
                            as if Ruskin considered punctuation a decorative feature. Mere embellishment to impress might have been Margaret Ruskin's explanation, 
                            who declared to her husband that John's "showing you his writing" in pen and ink "occupied his thoughts fully more than how he expressed his feelings" 
                            (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/apparatuses/mr_to_jjr_1827-04-28_al_apparatus" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-letter-">Margaret to John James Ruskin, <span class="date-1827-04-28">28 April 1827</span></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;

                            One might infer that adoption of pen and ink drew Ruskin more self-consciously to imitating printed materials. 
                            If so, what distinguishes the new stage of imitation is that, whereas the earlier pencil manuscripts invented new punctuation such as the justification mark in order to approximate print, 
                            the ersatz punctuation in the ink manuscripts appears to serve no consistent purpose.</div>
               
               <div class="p">For example, the poem "Eudosia" exhibits many instances of a mark consisting of two dots arranged horizontally and used as end-of-line punctuation. 
                            It might be meant as an ellipsis, but its rhetorical or grammatical function seems indistinguishable from the frequent commas added to the ends of other lines of the poem. 
                            A version of this mark also appears in "Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III," but here the two horizontal dots are followed by a superscript apostrophe or single quotation mark. 
                            It may be that this instance represents two separate marks, with the single quotation mark indicating the close of a speech. 
                            The mark does not in fact follow a speech, but Ruskin seems to misunderstand quotations, since he rarely encloses direct quotations with marks at both ends, 
                            and he sometimes applies quotation marks to indirect discourse. Another possibility is that the two horizontal dots followed by a hook are meant as a semicolon, 
                            an unlikely possibility were it not that, in "The Monastery," all the (vertical) semicolons are upside-down, 
                            with the hook above the dot. So far in ERM, we have not attempted to apply a TEI glyph element to these mysterious marks, 
                            since we are unable to classify them.

                        with one another if the content fails to supply a clue. It is understandable that a home&#x2010;schooled youth 
                        would initially imitate his mother&#x02BC;s hand, particularly in a household like the Ruskins&#x02BC;, 
                        from which the father was absent for protracted periods. <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> was, after all, 
                        the most constant daily influence on <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s early education, including his penmanship. 
                        A possible example, however, of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> mimicking his father&#x02BC;s cursive hand appears on the front flyleaves of his boyhood copy of

                        This manuscript originated as a fair copy of the poem, using an ink, print&#x2010;lettered hand similar in appearance to the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> fair copy of <span class="title-poem-JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span>, which is dated ca. <span class="date-1827-1828">1827&#x2013;28</span> (books 1&#x2013;2). 
                        In the margins, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> revised the poem in a sprawling cursive hand, using both pen and pencil. This version of <span class="title-poem-JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</span> is undated, 
                        but it certainly predated the <span class="date-1827-1828">late 1827&#x2013;early 1828</span>

                        who had held the post of writing master and accountant at the Royal High School, <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span>, 
                        until <span class="date-1793">1793</span>, shortly before <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> enrolled at that institution in <span class="date-1795">1795</span>.</div>
            
            
            <div class="p">Apparently, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> regarded this juncture in the development of his son&#x02BC;s handwriting as a coming of age, 
                        analogous to his own. When <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> enrolled at the Edinburgh Royal High at age ten, 
                        he was already somewhat older than his class, the customary starting age being eight&#x2014;<span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s age when first using a pen. 
                        Scottish burgh schools like the Edinburgh Royal High in theory championed a democratic ideal 
                        of seating tradesmen&#x02BC;s sons alongside those of patricians, and fees were kept moderate. Nonetheless, the Ruskin family 
                        may have delayed in order to scrape together the means even for moderate fees, or <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s mother, <span class="persName-CTWR">Catherine</span>, 
                        may have been apprehensive of exposing him to a famously sadistic Latin master

                        Given his own delayed matriculation, whatever its cause, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> perhaps acted with deliberate resolve in introducing his son in <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, at age eight,

                        (reproduced from engraving or woodcut and, later, from lithograph). Subcategories of copybooks specialized in particular disciplines or audiences,

                        Most copybooks modeled the formal script known as <i>English round hand</i> or <i>copperplate</i>, for which 
                        an influential standard had been set by the copybook, <span class="title-manual_guide-BICKHAMUNIVERSALPENMAN"><i>Universal Penman</i></span> (<span class="date-1733-1741">1733&#x2013;41</span>),

                        round hand called for a looping style that accentuated contrasts of thin and thick strokes, a style related to the late eighteenth&#x2010;century transitional and modern typefaces 
                        that featured these extreme contrasts, such as Baskerville and Bodoni

                        In the eighteenth century, round hand settled into a practical but elegant script that was less elaborate than earlier versions, and that was widely used in business. 
                        In the view of a historian of calligraphy, the common English round hand was &#x201C;colourless, thoroughly unromantic, and dull&#x201D;; however, these &#x201C;were precisely 
                        the qualities which commended &#x005B;the hand&#x005D; to those who wrote our invoices and to those abroad who received them&#x201D;; and this &#x201C;plain hand for a plain purpose&#x201D; 
                        was typified in the nineteenth century by &#x201C;the books of <span class="persName-EDB">Butterworth</span>&#x201D;, in which the hand became &#x201C;even more matter&#x2010;of&#x2010;fact and more standardised&#x201D;
