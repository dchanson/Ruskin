                <p>In addition, an <placeName corresp="#USA">American</placeName> edition, published in <placeName corresp="#NEWYORK">New York</placeName> by <orgName corresp="#JWILEY">John Wiley and Sons</orgName> in <date when="1878">1878</date>, was based on the second edition. 
                    Of the <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">British</placeName> editions, only the fifth carries a publisher&#x02BC;s imprint on the title page: 
                    <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>: / <persName corresp="#ES">Elliot Stock</persName>, 62, <placeName corresp="#PATERNOSTER">Paternoster Row</placeName>. This edition was issued also in a large format, 
                    a &#x201C;special edition printed for the members of the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Society&#x201D;. Of the <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">British</placeName> editions prior to the fifth&#x2014;certainly the first, and presumably the second through the fourth, as well&#x2014;were 
                    &#x201C;printed for private circulation,&#x201D; 
                    according to a clipping attached to a copy of the first edition held by the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Library, <orgName corresp="#LANCASTERU">Lancaster</orgName>, and copies were available &#x201C;on application to the editor&#x201D;. See also the description of the publication 
                    in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="anthology" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 38:110. 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SHEPHERDDNB"><persName corresp="#JFRCOLLINS">Collins</persName>, <title corresp="#SHEPERDDNB">&#x201C;Richard Herne Shepherd,&#x201D;</title></ref> mentions that some of <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> works were published by his brother, 
                    who ran a bookshop in <placeName corresp="#HOLBORN">Holborn</placeName> under the name of <persName corresp="#FH">Frank Hollings</persName>, but this arrangement would not have come about prior to <date when="1892">1892</date> 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PADENTENNYSONSHEPHERDWISE">Paden, <title type="essay" corresp="#TENNYSONSHEPHERDWISE">&#x201C;Tennyson&#x02BC;s <hi rend="italic">The Lover&#x02BC;s Tale</hi>, Shepherd, and Wise,&#x201D;</title> 117n</ref>).</p>
                <p>The first, third, and fifth editions appear to have been published without the compiler&#x02BC;s name anywhere indicated, whether on the title page or at the end of the introduction.</p> 
                <p>The first four editions carry a dedication to the artist, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="backhouse_h_f_note.php">Henry Backhouse</ref> 
                    (his full name given as <persName corresp="#HFB">Henry Fleetwood Backhouse</persName>, starting with the third edition), &#x201C;who first
                    suggested to the compiler the idea of this little bibliography&#x201D;. Perhaps <persName corresp="#HFB">Backhouse</persName> originally helped subsidize the publication, 
                    since the dedication is dropped from the fifth edition, published by <persName corresp="#ES">Elliot Stock</persName>; 
                    or perhaps <persName corresp="#HFB">Backhouse</persName> was simply one of the avid <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> &#x201C;collectors&#x201D; to whom the author hoped the bibliography would &#x201C;prove useful&#x201D;, according to the clipping on the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Library copy.</p>
                <p>Expansion and reissue of the bibliography was planned from the start, since, in the introduction to the first edition, the author anticipates &#x201C;more fortunate or more persistent research&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RUSKINBIBLIOGRAPHYSHEPHERD1"><persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName>, <title type="bibliography" corresp="#RUSKINBIBLIOGRAPHYSHEPHERD"><hi rend="italic">Bibliography of Ruskin</hi> [1st ed.]</title></ref>, vii). Already expanded for reissue a month later, 
                    the second edition names with thanks several individuals who supplied additional items for description 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RUSKINBIBLIOGRAPHYSHEPHERD2"><persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName>, <title type="bibliography" corresp="#RUSKINBIBLIOGRAPHYSHEPHERD"><hi rend="italic">Bibliography of Ruskin</hi> [2d ed.]</title></ref>, viii). The list attests that influential persons 
                    took an interest in the project.</p> 
                <p>Doubtless <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> had also hoped from the start to gain an acknowledgment from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>
                    himself. In a letter of <date when="1878-09-30">30 September 1878</date>, written apparently in response to receiving the first edition, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> answered <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName>: &#x201C;So far from being distasteful to me, your
                    perfect reckoning up of me not only flatters my vanity extremely, but will be in
                    the highest degree useful to myself. But you know so much more about me than I
                    now remember about anything, that I can&#x02BC;t find a single thing to correct or
                    add&#x2014;glancing through at least. I will not say you have wasted your time;
                    but I may at least regret the quantity of trouble the book must have given you.
                    . . .&#x201D; In a second letter, dated <date when="1878-10-23">23 October
                        1878</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> acknowledges receipt
                    undoubtedly of the second edition: "I am very deeply grateful to you, as I am in
                    all duty bound, for this very curious record of myself. It will be of extreme
                    value to me in filling up what gaps I can in this patched coverlid of my life,
                    before it is draped over my coffin&#x2014;if it may be. I am especially glad to
                    have note of the letters to newspapers&#x201D;. These letters are printed as
                    loose inserts included with the second edition, at least as found in the Ruskin
                    Library&#x02BC;s copy, but various evidence confirms that the letters did originally
                    belong to that edition.<note>The American edition, published by Wiley<!--Which Wiley?  Charles, John, or one of the other sons?--> and based
                        on the second edition, carries the <date when="1878-09-30">30 September</date> letter, printed opposite the
                        title page. In both the <placeName corresp="#USA">American</placeName> and the <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">British</placeName> second editions, this
                        letter is prefaced by the explanation: &#x201c;The Compiler of this Bibliography
                        has had the honour to receive, in acknowledgment of a copy which he sent to
                        <placeName corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName>, the following letter from <persName corresp="#JR">Mr. Ruskin</persName>&#x201d;. The second letter, as
                        suggested by its <date when="1878-10-23">23 October 1878</date> date, may likewise have accompanied the
                        second edition; however, the origin of its separate printed card is unclear.
                        The Bodleian Library copy of the second edition, as shown online in Google
                        Books, includes only the first <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> letter.</note> It is no accident,
                    therefore, that the second edition carried <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> name in print, as did the
                    fourth, which likewise involved self&#x2010;advertisement using <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> letters (see
                    below).</p> 
                <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> comment in the October letter about his interest in &#x201C;the letters to newspapers&#x201D; refers to a particular interest of <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName>. In the introduction to the first edition of the bibliography, 
                    <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> expressed his special solicitude to track down the public letters, and the second edition does 
                    contain additional entries of this kind. One wonders if <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> was planning to collect these ephemera; if so, he was trumped by <persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName>, who with <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> support collected 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> public letters to newspapers in  
                    <title type="anthology" corresp="#RUSKINARROWS" rend="italic">Arrows of the Chase</title>, published in <date when="1880">1880</date> (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 34:xxxviii).<note><persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>
                        prints <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> letters to <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> in <title type="anthology" corresp="#RUSKINARROWS" rend="italic">Arrows of the Chase</title>, noting that the letters are &#x201C;given in the List of &#x2018;Mr. <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> Publications,&#x2019; <!--Tim: Where does this line's double quotation mark teminate?-->

                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 34:537). The texts of both letters, <date when="1878-09">September</date> and <date when="1878-10">October 1878</date>, are indeed 
                        found in the back matter of <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DICKENSBIBLIOGRAPHYSHEPHERD"><persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName>, <title type="bibliography" corresp="#DICKENSBIBLIOGRAPHYSHEPHERD"><hi rend="italic">The Bibliography of Dickens</hi></title></ref>), 
                        following numerous complimentary squibs from journals about <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> bibliography. <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</persName> remark in <title type="anthology" corresp="#RUSKINARROWS" rend="italic">Arrows of the Chase</title> suggests that he took the texts of the letters 
                        from this source and knew nothing about their prior printing to accompany the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> bibliography. The list printed at the back of the <persName corresp="#CJHD">Dickens</persName> bibliography advertises specifically the fourth edition 
                        of the bibliography, which is the one other edition besides the second to bear <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> name in print.</note></p>
                <p>In each edition of the bibliography except the last, which drops the author&#x02BC;s introduction, <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> dwells on his care: &#x201C;the materials for [the bibliography&#x02BC;s] compilation have taken many years to collect, 
                    and much anxious labour has been spent on its preparation and arrangement. No entry has in any case been made at second&#x2010;hand; but always with the actual book, pamphlet,
                    magazine, or journal described lying before the compiler&#x201D;. Indeed, the thoroughness of Shepherd&#x02BC;s sleuthing is impressive. Entries on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> early publications are in some cases annotated 
                    with quotations identifying or legitimating the piece. For example,  <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> authenticates his entry for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> two <date when="1834">1834</date> essays published in <title type="periodical" corresp="#MAGAZINEOFNATURALHISTORY"><hi rend="italic">The Magazine of Natural History</hi></title>,

                    and <title type="essay" corresp="#RUSKINMONTBLANC">&#x201C;Facts and Considerations on the Strata of <geogName corresp="#MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</geogName>,&#x201D;</title> by quoting a footnote from the so&#x2010;called

                        literary patron who sent words of mine to be actually set up in print, in his
