                <p>Hypothyroidism is defined as a condition of &#x201C;mild to severe impairment of physical and mental development due to an untreated deficiency of thyroid hormones&#x201D;. 
                    Historically, the condition has been endemic to regions with diets deficient in iodine. The resulting disorders include goiter (enlargement of the thyroid gland) 
                    and the severe stunting of development that in the <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth century</date> was called <hi rend="italic">cretinism</hi> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PAPAGEORGOPOULOUHYPOTHYROIDISM"><persName corresp="#CPAPAGEORGOPOULOU">Papageorgopoulou</persName>, <persName corresp="#KSTAUB">Staub</persName>, and <persName corresp="#FRUHLI">R&#x00FC;hli</persName>, <title type="article" corresp="#PAPAGEORGOPOULOUHYPOTHYROIDISM">&#x201C;Hypothyroidism in Switzerland&#x201D;</title></ref>, 77). 
                    A causal connection between the two disorders only began to be perceived in the <date notBefore="1850" notAfter="1899">second half of the nineteenth century</date> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MERKEHISTORYOFGOITRE"><persName corresp="#FMERKE">Merke</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#MERKEHISTORYOFGOITRE"><hi rend="italic">History and Iconography of Endemic Goitre and Cretinism</hi></title></ref>, 214, 231&#x2013;33).</p>
                
                <p>In <geogName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</geogName>, Alpine regions are severely deficient in iodine, because glaciation eroded the element during the Quaternary Ice Age. 
                    Accordingly, since antiquity, inhabitants of these regions were known to be afflicted with goiter and cretinism; and with the rise of scientific and Romantic travel 
                    in the <date notBefore="1750" notAfter="1799">second half of the eighteenth century</date>, these disorders became associated especially with parts of <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName> 
                    and <placeName corresp="#SAVOY">Savoy</placeName>. Observers also acknowledged, however, that incidence of the disorders could be sharply localized. 
                    The differences arose from regional variations in soil geology, which were a legacy of patterns of glaciation, as well as from such accidental circumstances as inhabitants&#x02BC; access to an iodine&#x2010;rich salt mine. 
                    For example, the disorders were virtually unknown in the higher <geogName corresp="#JURA">Jura</geogName>, which were not covered with glaciers during the Ice Age, 
                    whereas goiter and cretinism had been observed and recorded since the Middle Ages in the valleys on both sides of the pass of the <geogName corresp="#STBERNARD">Great St. Bernard</geogName>&#x2014;the 
                    <geogName corresp="#VALDAOSTA">Val d&#x02BC;Aosta</geogName> and the <geogName corresp="#RHONE">Rh&#x00F4;ne</geogName> valley in <placeName corresp="#CANTONVALAIS">Valais</placeName>. 
                    These regional variations mystified researchers attempting to isolate a cause; and while some scientists proposed a connection between the disorders and iodine deficiency 
                    as early as the nineteenth century, it was not until the <date notBefore="1900" notAfter="1949">first half of the twentieth century</date> that the etiology was fully understood, 
                    prompting effective programs in <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName> to supplement the iodine deficiency in diet 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MERKEHISTORYOFGOITRE"><persName corresp="#FMERKE">Merke</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#MERKEHISTORYOFGOITRE"><hi rend="italic">History and Iconography of Endemic Goitre and Cretinism</hi></title></ref>, 219&#x2013;21, 12&#x2013;22, 67&#x2013;69; 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PAPAGEORGOPOULOUHYPOTHYROIDISM"><persName corresp="#CPAPAGEORGOPOULOU">Papageorgopoulou</persName>, <persName corresp="#KSTAUB">Staub</persName>, and <persName corresp="#FRUHLI">R&#x00FC;hli</persName>, <title type="article" corresp="#PAPAGEORGOPOULOUHYPOTHYROIDISM">&#x201C;Hypothyroidism in Switzerland&#x201D;</title></ref>, 80).</p>
                
                <p>The sharp variations of incidence seem to have invited extensive speculation about causes. <persName corresp="#FMERKE">F. Merke</persName> remarks that the nineteenth&#x2010;century medical literature on goiter 
                    &#x201C;became increasingly voluminous but also more and more muddled&#x201D;. Likewise, &#x201C;fanciful, speculative hypotheses&#x201D; beset understanding of endemic cretinism, 
                    though <persName corresp="#FMERKE">Merke</persName> emphasizes that &#x201C;the &#x2018;medical&#x2019; history of cretinism is . . . much more recent 
                    than that of goitre, but the iconographic representation of cretins is centuries older&#x201D;
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MERKEHISTORYOFGOITRE"><title type="book" corresp="#MERKEHISTORYOFGOITRE"><hi rend="italic">History and Iconography of Endemic Goitre and Cretinism</hi></title></ref>, 192, 214, 195). 
                    Travel writing stoked the speculation. While rendering certain locales notorious for goiter and cretinism, such as the <geogName corresp="#RHONE">Rh&#x00F4;ne</geogName> valley in <placeName corresp="#CANTONVALAIS">Valais</placeName> 
                    or the <geogName corresp="#VALDAOSTA">Val d&#x02BC;Aosta</geogName>, writers were readily led to compare the causes that had been commonly advanced 
                    for hypothyroidism; and finding the evidence geographically inconsistent, championed theories that seemed to confirm the shrewdness of their own personal observations 
                    (see, e.g., <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EBELTRAVELLERSGUIDE"><persName corresp="#JGE">Ebel</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#EBELTRAVELLERSGUIDE"><hi rend="italic">Traveller&#x02BC;s Guide through Switzerland</hi></title></ref>, 361; 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book for Travellers in Switzerland</hi></title></ref>, 156; and see 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MERKEHISTORYOFGOITRE"><persName corresp="#FMERKE">Merke</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#MERKEHISTORYOFGOITRE"><hi rend="italic">History and Iconography of Endemic Goitre and Cretinism</hi></title></ref>, 219&#x2013;21, 225&#x2013;27).</p>
                
               <p>Thus, on the evidence of <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_mary_note.php"><persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName></ref>&#x02BC;s diary, the Ruskins first came face to face 
                   with victims of severe goiter and cretinism in <placeName corresp="#SION">Sion</placeName>, the chief municipality of <placeName corresp="#CANTONVALAIS">Canton Valais</placeName>. Taking a walk through the town, 
                   <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName>, <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>, and <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> found <placeName corresp="#SION">Sion</placeName> 
                   &#x201C;dirty and desolate looking&#x201D;; and in <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName>&#x02BC;s view, &#x201C;the people [were] all miserable creatures, two out of three hav[ing] goitre very bad, and many of them . . . idiots&#x201D; 
                   (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48">Diary of <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName>, <date when="1833">1833</date></ref>, 69). 
                   The perception can be authenticated by evidence, but may also have been preconditioned. It is true that, as confirmed in <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName> by a national health survey in the <date notBefore="1920" notAfter="1929">1920s</date>, 
                   which was undertaken to determine young men&#x02BC;s eligibility for military service, the numbers of young males with goiter increased dramatically, for instance, in the portion of the <geogName corresp="#RHONE">Rh&#x00F4;ne</geogName> valley surrounding <placeName corresp="#SION">Sion</placeName> 
                   (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MERKEHISTORYOFGOITRE"><persName corresp="#FMERKE">Merke</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#MERKEHISTORYOFGOITRE"><hi rend="italic">History and Iconography of Endemic Goitre and Cretinism</hi></title></ref>, 29&#x2013;36;
                   <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PAPAGEORGOPOULOUHYPOTHYROIDISM"><persName corresp="#CPAPAGEORGOPOULOU">Papageorgopoulou</persName>, <persName corresp="#KSTAUB">Staub</persName>, and <persName corresp="#FRUHLI">R&#x00FC;hli</persName>, <title type="article" corresp="#PAPAGEORGOPOULOUHYPOTHYROIDISM">&#x201C;Hypothyroidism in Switzerland&#x201D;</title></ref>, 82). 
                   The Ruskins may have been led to expect this change, however, by popular print culture of travel: in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROSCOETOURISTSWITZERLANDITALY"><title type="annual" corresp="#ROSCOETOURISTSWITZERLANDITALY"><hi rend="italic">The Tourist in Switzerland and Italy</hi></title></ref>, 
                   which was the <title type="annual" corresp="#ROSCOETOURISTSWITZERLANDITALY"><hi rend="italic">Jenning&#x02BC;s Landscape Annual for <date when="1830">1830</date></hi></title>, illustrated by <ref type="note" target="prout_samuel_note.php"><persName corresp="#SP">Samuel Prout</persName></ref>, 
                   <persName corresp="#TRT">Thomas Roscoe</persName> alerts the reader that &#x201C;[a]t a short distance from <placeName corresp="#SION">Sion</placeName>" upriver toward <placeName corresp="#BRIG">Brig</placeName>, 
                   where the district divides &#x201C;into what is called the <placeName corresp="#HAUTVALAIS">Haut</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#BASVALAIS">Bas Valois</placeName> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]&#x201D;, one remarks &#x201C;a marked difference between the 
                   inhabitants of these two portions of the same district&#x201D;. Injecting judgments about moral character into observations of disease, <persName corresp="#TRT">Roscoe</persName> marks 
                   &#x201C;[t]he former&#x201D;, the inhabitants of the <placeName corresp="#HAUTVALAIS">Haut&#x2010;Valais</placeName>, as &#x201C;an industrious people; simple and inoffensive in their manners, strong and healthful in their 
                   persons, and of comely appearance. The latter&#x201D;, living in the <placeName corresp="#BASVALAIS">Bas&#x2010;Valais</placeName>, &#x201C;are squalid and wretched, frightfully deformed with the goitrous swelling, and many of them more or less affected with <hi rend="italic">cretinism</hi>&#x201D; 
                   (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROSCOETOURISTSWITZERLANDITALY"><title type="annual" corresp="#ROSCOETOURISTSWITZERLANDITALY"><persName corresp="#TRT">Roscoe</persName>, <hi rend="italic">The Tourist in Switzerland and Italy</hi></title></ref>, 101).</p>
                
                <p>Of the opinions about causes of goiter and cretinism contained in British travel writing of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date> 
                    that the Ruskins are likely to have read, probably all can be traced to another source, more or less scientific or moralizing in their speculation. 
                    In <date notBefore="1837" notAfter="1829">1827&#x2013;29</date>, <persName corresp="#WBI">William Brockedon</persName> favored the idea that the disorders arose from &#x201C;dirty habits&#x201D;. 
                    &#x201C;The author&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#WBI">Brockedon</persName> wrote about himself, &#x201C;has adopted an opinion, arising from extensive observation, that one of the chief causes of these complaints 
                    is to be found in the dirty habits of the communities afflicted. This is an opinion entertained by the clean and healthy mountaineers, 
                    who are free from goitre, and by the inhabitants of those valleys where personal cleanliness is regarded: 
                    for this the <orgName corresp="#ANZASCANS">Anzascans</orgName> [i.e., inhabitants of <geogName corresp="#ANZASCA">Anzasca</geogName> valley], a race of fine men and beautiful women, 
                    are remarkable; whilst the dirty wretches where the affliction is found, sty all the winter with their cattle, 
                    seldom or never change their clothes, and dread water as if their disease were hydrophobia. Three or four filthy generations produce goitre, 
                    and it requires as many of clean habits to remove the punishment for their foul offences&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BROCKEDONILLUSTRATIONS"><title type="book" corresp="#BROCKEDONILLUSTRATIONS"><hi rend="italic">Illustrations of the Passes of the Alps</hi></title></ref>, 
                    <geogName corresp="#SIMPLON">&#x201C;The Simplon&#x201D;</geogName>, 4&#x2013;5 n.). Earlier in the century, others before <persName corresp="#WBI">Brockedon</persName> 
                    blamed the dunghills in <placeName corresp="#SION">Sion</placeName> for cretinism, and compared the inhabitants&#x02BC; hygiene unfavorably with the habits of highlanders 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MERKEHISTORYOFGOITRE"><persName corresp="#FMERKE">Merke</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#MERKEHISTORYOFGOITRE"><hi rend="italic">History and Iconography of Endemic Goitre and Cretinism</hi></title></ref>, 226).</p>
                
                <p>Writing in <date when="1838">1838</date>, <persName corresp="#JM">John Murray III</persName> insisted for his part that &#x201C;careful attention to the circumstances accompanying its [goiter&#x02BC;s] appearance 
                    will show that it is connected with the condition of the atmosphere, and is found in low, warm, and moist situations, 
                    at the bottom of valleys, where a stagnation of water occurs, and where the summer exhalations and autumnal fogs arising from it 
                    are not carried off by a free circulation of air. It is found in places where the valley is confined, and shut in, as it were&#x2014;where 
                    a free draft is checked by its sides being clothed with wood, or by a sudden bend occurring in its direction&#x2014;where, at the same time, 
                    the bottom is subject to the overflowings of a river, or to extensive artificial irrigation. The conjecture which derives the disease 
                    from breathing an atmosphere of this kind, not liable to be purified by fresh currents of air to carry off the vapours, 
                    is, perhaps, the one most deserving of consideration&#x201D;. It was surely no accident that this list of environmental conditions matches exactly 
                    (one wonders if even uniquely matches) those surrounding <placeName corresp="#MARTIGNY">Martigny</placeName>, where the <geogName corresp="#RHONE">Rh&#x00F4;ne</geogName> makes an almost ninety&#x2010;degree bend, 
                    and the broad flat of the valley formed a marsh between the extraordinary heights of the <geogName corresp="#BERNESEALPS">Bernese Alps</geogName> on the north side and the <geogName corresp="#PENNINEALPS">Pennine Alps</geogName> on the south. 
                    In the section of the guidebook devoted to <placeName corresp="#MARTIGNY">Martigny</placeName>, <persName corresp="#MURRAY">Murray</persName> circularly applies his general theory to explain the prevalence of cretinism in the locale 
                    that probably prompted the theory in the first place 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book for Travellers in Switzerland</hi></title></ref>, lix, 156). 
                    Ultimately, however, the theory was indebted to a scientist well known to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, 
                    <persName corresp="#HBS">Horace-B&#x00E9;n&#x00E9;dict de Saussure</persName>, who attributed goiter and cretinism to the climatic factors 
                    of heat and stagnant air in Alpine valleys (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MERKEHISTORYOFGOITRE"><persName corresp="#FMERKE">Merke</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#MERKEHISTORYOFGOITRE"><hi rend="italic">History and Iconography of Endemic Goitre and Cretinism</hi></title></ref>, 206&#x2013;8).</p>
                
                <p>The language used by such writers to describe the effects of hypothyroidism is often blunt in its moralizing implications: 
                    expect no lessons in sympathetic imagination with disability to have been taken from <persName corresp="#WW">Wordsworth</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#WORDSWORTHIDIOTBOY">&#x201C;The Idiot Boy&#x201D;</title>. 
                    For <persName corresp="#WBI">Brockedon</persName>, cretins are &#x201C;objects of disgust and pity&#x201D;; for <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>, &#x201C;[t]he cretin is an idiot&#x2014;a melancholy spectacle&#x2014;a creature who may almost be said to rank a step below a human being. 
                    There is vacancy in his countenance; his head is disproportionately large; his limbs are stunted or crippled; he cannot articulate his words with distinctness; 
                    and there is scarcely any work which he is capable of executing. He spends his days basking in the sun, and, from its warmth, appears to derive great gratification. 
                    When a stranger appears, he becomes a clamorous and importunate beggar, assailing him with a ceaseless chattering;
