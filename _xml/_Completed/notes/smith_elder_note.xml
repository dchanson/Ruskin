                <p>The firm began in <date when="1816">1816</date> as a <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> stationer and bookseller, 
                    founded by two Scotsmen, <persName corresp="#GS">George Smith</persName> (<date notBefore="1789-01-01" notAfter="1846-08-21">1789&#x2013;1846</date>) and <persName corresp="#AE">Alexander Elder</persName> (<date notBefore="1790-01-01" notAfter="1876-12-31">1790&#x2013;1876</date>). 
                    According to <persName corresp="#SSL">Sidney Lee</persName>, the partners undertook their first modest publishing venture in <date when="1819">1819</date>, 
                    when they were admitted to the <orgName corresp="#STATIONERSCO">Stationers&#x02bc; Company</orgName>, although more recently <persName corresp="#BBELL">Bill Bell</persName> has shown evidence 
                    that they began publishing in a small way from the beginning in <date when="1816">1816</date> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LEESMITHMEMOIR"><persName corresp="#SSL">Lee</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#LEESMITHMEMOIR">&#x201C;Memoir of <persName corresp="#GS">George Smith</persName>&#x201D;</title></ref>, 3&#x2013;4;

                    <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s initial dealings with the firm appear to have been as a customer of their stationery and books. 
                    For example, an entry in his household accounts for <date when="1827-06">June 1827</date> shows the notation,
                    &#x201c;Paid for Books to <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith E</orgName>&#x201d;, followed by a list of titles

                    Thus, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> was among the &#x201c;friendly Scotch <hi rend="italic">client&#x00E8;le</hi>&#x201d; that, according to a history of the firm, <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> 
                    supplied with writing materials, books new and used, and bookbinding services in its early days, as suggested by the preponderance of Scottish titles of books and music recorded in a daybook 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER"><persName corresp="#LHUXLEY">Huxley</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER"><hi rend="italic">The House of Smith Elder</hi></title></ref>, 4).</p>
                
                <p>When first established, the premises were located in <placeName corresp="#FENCHURCHST">Fenchurch Street</placeName>, near to the counting house of 
                    <orgName corresp="#RUSKINETAL">Ruskin, Telford, &#x0026; Domecq</orgName> in <placeName corresp="#BILLITERST">Billiter Street</placeName>, which linked <placeName corresp="#FENCHURCHST">Fenchurch Street</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#LEADENHALLST">Leadenhall Street</placeName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HILTONRUSKINEARLYYEARS"><persName corresp="#THILTON">Hilton</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HILTONRUSKINEARLYYEARS"><hi rend="italic">John Ruskin: The Early Years</hi></title></ref>, 29). 
                    In <date when="1824">1824</date>, the firm moved one street farther west to 65 <placeName corresp="#CORNHILL">Cornhill</placeName>; and taking on a third partner, it became <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder, &#x0026; Company</orgName>. 
                    An important part of the business was focused on exporting books and stationery to <placeName corresp="#INDIA">India</placeName>, 
                    supplying British subjects stationed with the <orgName corresp="#EASTINDIACO">East India Company</orgName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LEESMITHMEMOIR"><persName corresp="#SSL">Lee</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#LEESMITHMEMOIR">&#x201C;Memoir of <persName corresp="#GS">George Smith</persName>&#x201D;</title></ref>, 4&#x2013;6). 
                    The headquarters of the <orgName corresp="#EASTINDIACO">East India Company</orgName>, <placeName type="building" corresp="#EASTINDIAHOUSE">East India House</placeName>, 
                    was situated close by (see <ref type="note" subtype="geographical" target="london_city_note.php">City of London</ref>; see also <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Book</ref>).</p>
                
                <p>It would have mattered to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> that the founders of the firm, <persName corresp="#GS">George Smith</persName> and <persName corresp="#AE">Alexander Elder</persName> were, 
                    like himself, Scotsmen who were the first in their respective families to leave <placeName corresp="#NBRITAIN">North Britain</placeName> in order to seek better 
                    mercantile opportunities and cultured, metropolitan lives in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>. They also opened a window onto the romance of literary life. 
                    <persName corresp="#GS">Smith</persName> had served in the firm of <orgName corresp="#MURRAY">John Murray</orgName>, the publisher of <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName>, 
                    and even had the honor on one occasion to deliver proof sheets to the poet himself&#x2014;or, in a more colorful version of the story, 
                    carried an inquiry about a new edition that caused <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName> to spring up and dance around the room 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LEESMITHMEMOIR"><persName corresp="#SSL">Lee</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#LEESMITHMEMOIR">&#x201C;Memoir of <persName corresp="#GS">George Smith</persName>&#x201D;</title></ref>, 3;

                    <p>It was <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName> who oversaw the fledgling publishing arm of the business, however; 
                    and although the earlier memoirs characterize his involvement as &#x201c;spasmodic&#x201d;, <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName> counted as a central figure 
                    for the expatriate literary Scotsmen in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> during the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</date>, 
                    according to <persName corresp="#GH">Gillian Hughes</persName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LEESMITHMEMOIR"><persName corresp="#SSL">Lee</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#LEESMITHMEMOIR">&#x201C;Memoir of <persName corresp="#GS">George Smith</persName>&#x201D;</title></ref>, 7;

                    Among these Scots &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9; writers and editors were <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="pringle_thomas_note.php"><persName corresp="#TP">Thomas Pringle</persName> (<date notBefore="1789" notAfter="1834">1789&#x2013;1834</date>)</ref> 
                    and his friend <persName corresp="#LR">Leitch Ritchie</persName> (<date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1865">1800&#x2013;1865</date>)&#x2014;both future editors of

                    was key to the success of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder &#x0026; Company</orgName> as a fine art and literary publisher. The firm took over this literary annual in <date when="1827">1827</date> from a neigboring bookseller 
                    in <placeName corresp="#CORNHILL">Cornhill Street</placeName>, <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Lupton Relfe</persName>, and rapidly developed it from a pale imitation

                    particularly effective in the firm&#x02bc;s make&#x2010;over of <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php"><title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title></ref>.</p>
                
                <p>Again, <persName corresp="#AE">Alexander Elder</persName>&#x02bc;s tastes appear to have been key in the up&#x2010;to&#x2010;date and high quality of the firm&#x02bc;s illustrated publications, 
                    for he was also an art enthusiast, and commissioned a number of ambitious portfolios of picturesque views. Among the earliest of these was

                    Printed in aquatint, each plate sold at half a guinea, the series realizing a profit beyond the artist&#x02bc;s substantial commission of &#x00A3;1,000

                    The high quality of art reproduction that the firm had achieved by the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> is testified by its role in producing

                    Perhaps <persName corresp="#CTR">Charles</persName>&#x02bc;s gift to <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> prompted <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> to seek the acquaintance. 
                    <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02bc;s editorship of the annual started in <date when="1828">1828</date>&#x2014;his first volume being that for <date when="1829">1829</date>

                    as editor until his death in <date when="1834-12">December 1834</date>, having prepared the volume for <date when="1835">1835</date> (i.e., the volume for the holiday season of <date notBefore="1834-11" notAfter="1835-01">1834&#x2013;35</date>). 
                    This last volume, which featured the young <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s first poems for the annual, was substantially completed during the <date notBefore="1834-06-21" notAfter="1834-09-22">summer of 1834</date> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#VIGNEPRINGLE">Vigne, <hi rend="italic">Thomas Pringle</hi></ref>, 244). In the latter volume, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> made his first
