                        since more rapid crossings were made possible by the rise of steam packet lines. The steam packets accommodated large excursion parties 
                        along with individual travelers, providing amenities such as food and drink and even entertainment, with music performance being common onboard

                        For travelers of modest means, the steam lines greatly increased the efficiency, reliability, and carrying capacity, improvements that were critical

                    <p>On the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1833_note.php">Tour of 1833</ref>, the young travelers soon got into the spirit of English bemusement

                        and his cousin, <persName corresp="MRC">Mary Richardson</persName>, in her travel diary. At the start of the tour, Mary 
                        was &#x201C;much amused with the postillion cracking his whip very loud&#x201D; to encourage his &#x201C;most miserable looking animals&#x201D;, but she soon 
                        professed weariness over &#x201C;waiting a long time as usual&#x201D; for horses as &#x201C;for every thing in this country&#x201D;. In a set piece flavored 
                        with Dickensian irony, she narrates the upset caused by an incompetent postilion who, as &#x201C;a coachman&#x201D; and unused &#x201C;to ride on horseback&#x201D;, 
                        &#x201C;got frightened and trembled all over&#x201D; and nearly ran their horses into a shop, 
                        bringing a crowd into the street to surround and burden the carriage with assistance. He was replaced by a postilion affecting such nonchalance that, 
                        &#x201C;with the greatest coolness . . . [he] stopped 20 times to sort something or other&#x201D; with the tackle. In general, she concludes 
                        disapprovingly, &#x201C;[i]n France and Belgium, the postillions stop in the middle of every stage, if only five miles, to get beer or brandy&#x201D;, 
                        cracking their whips on approach to a place where someone would always bring them their refreshment&#x201D;

                    <p>As guides, besides relying on the services of a cicerone, like <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="salvador_note.php"><persName corresp="#SALVADOR">Salvador</persName></ref>, 
                        the Ruskins carried guidebooks on their tours abroad. In the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1835">1820s through the mid&#x2010;1830s</date>
                        guidebooks, like middle&#x2010;class travel generally, were undergoing a transition. The vade&#x2010;mecum for English travelers 
                        landing in <placeName corresp="#NORMANDY">Normandy</placeName> and the Low Countries, <persName corresp="#JM">John Murray III</persName>&#x02BC;s

                        did not become available until <date when="1836">1836</date>. Whereas <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        <title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book</hi></title> is now often credited with founding the genre of the modern English traveler&#x02BC;s guidebook, 
                        for earlier journeys like the Ruskins&#x02BC;, taken after the reopening of the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName> following the <date when="1815-06-18">Battle of <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName></date> in  
                        <date notBefore="1815" notAfter="1836">1815 and continuing through the mid&#x2010;1830s</date>, travelers often relied on publications that combined personal travel narrative with some practical advice. 
                        As <persName corresp="#PF">Pieter Fran&#x00E7;ois</persName> has shown, in the period prior to the publication of <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book</hi></title>, 
                        there appeared numerous examples of the guidebook genre, particularly relating to the Low Countries, but in an emergent and somewhat inchoate form. 
                        Only gradually, after <date when="1815-06-18">Waterloo</date>, the modern guidebook emerged as a genre distinct from the so&#x2010;called 
                        <hi rend="italic">travel account</hi>, in that the guidebook came to offer mainly practical travel advice, 
                        whereas the more traditional travel account emphasized topographical description and narrative from an individual perspective 
                        (albeit not too individualistic, lest decorum and authority seem to succumb to eccentricity). In the immediate post&#x2010;Waterloo period, 
                        these genres were often mixed in the same book, with traces of the <date notBefore="1701" notAfter="1800">eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> travel account governing the narrative (for example, in the adoption of an epistolary form), 
                        while tables of practical advice were added to recommend the book in a crowded field 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRANCOIS1815"><persName corresp="#PF">Fran&#x00E7;ois</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#FRANCOIS1815">&#x201C;If It&#x02BC;s <date when="1815">1815</date>, This Must Be <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName>&#x201D;</title></ref>, 76&#x2013;82).
                    </p>
                    <p>This transitional and eclectic period of travel writing is reflected in the Ruskins&#x02BC; book purchases immediately before and after 
                        their first major Continental journey, that of <date when="1833">1833</date> journey. Besides arming themselves with a German grammar book, 
                        the Ruskins carried a work by <persName corresp="#MSA">Mariana Starke</persName> (<date notBefore="1762" notAfter="1838">1762&#x2013;1838</date>),

                        of travel writing, displaying characteristics both of the guidebook and the travel account, 
                        and whose work <persName corresp="#CB">Charles Batten</persName> similarly describes as moving away from the decorum of the <date notBefore="1701" notAfter="1800">eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> travel account

                        It was characteristic of the transitional period of travel writing, in having &#x201C;the appearance,

                        of an impressionistic &#x2018;travel book&#x2019;&#x201D;&#x2014;that is, as still relying, despite its &#x201C;serving as a makeshift [modern] &#x2018;handbook&#x2019;
