                <p>The collection inside <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s museum&#x2010;like residence ranged from Greek and Roman antiquities, to Old Masters, 
                    to eighteenth&#x2010; and nineteenth&#x2010;century British art, to curious objects of virtu. The library was significant for manuscripts, prints, and drawings,

                    was a major patron. In his acquisition of paintings and sculpture, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> oversaw a small but representative collection that,

                    in the &#x201C;true comprehension of the characteristic excellences of various painters&#x201D; than would a larger and more imposing collection. Old Master paintings included works by 
                    Italian primitive and Renaissance (especially Venetian) artists; Baroque Flemish and Dutch artists; and landscapists, both classical <placeName type="fictional" corresp="#ARCADIA">Arcadian</placeName> (e.g., <persName corresp="#CLAUDE">Claude</persName> 
                    and <persName corresp="#NP">Poussin</persName>) and Dutch. In British art, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s taste in figure and genre painting inclined to the modern

                <p><persName corresp="#TSP">Thomas Stothard</persName> was particularly important to <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s collecting and decorating, 
                    supplying not only works for the drawing and painting collections, but also illustrations for <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s own books, 
                    and even objects of interior design. A cabinet painted by him depicted characters from <persName corresp="#WSP">Shakespeare</persName>, <persName corresp="#GCP">Chaucer</persName>, 
                    and <persName corresp="#GBP">Boccaccio</persName>, likely designed in the rococo, <persName corresp="#JAW">Watteauesque</persName> style

                    <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>&#x02BC;s working relationship with <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> was established as early as <date when="1794">1794</date>, 
                    when the artist supplied a few cuts for an edition of <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSPLEASURES"><hi rend="italic">The Pleasures of Memory</hi></title>, followed by much more profusely illustrated editions of this 
                    and other poems, many of these editions published by the firm of <orgName corresp="#CADELLTHOMAS">Thomas Cadell</orgName>

                    The artist and patron shared political sympathies, <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName> having been apprenticed in his youth to <placeName corresp="#SPITALSFIELD">Spitalsfield</placeName> radicals and, 
                    as a young artist, formed close friendships with <persName corresp="#JFSCULPTOR">John Flaxman</persName> and <persName corresp="#WBP">William Blake</persName> (<date notBefore="1757" notAfter="1827">1757&#x2010;1827</date>)

                    <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s associations included some of these artists, as well as influential <orgName corresp="#WHIG">Whig</orgName> politicians

                <p>The house and collections were open to view by anyone with a respectable introduction, including the young <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName>, 
                    who was ushered to <placeName type="building" corresp="#STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</placeName> by the editor and poet,

                    in the <date when="1830">1830</date> illustrated edition, for his <date when="1832-02-08">8 February 1832</date> birthday, if <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> 
                    is accurate about the story of the boy&#x02BC;s first encounter with <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>.

                        This may have been an additional copy, however. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s birthday copy is said to have been a present from

                <p>In these earlier years, the significance of the <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> connection revolved around the poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, particularly 
                    the <date when="1830">1830</date> illustrated edition. <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> developed his poem over the course of several years. 
                    Basing its substance on his Continental tour of <date notBefore="1814" notAfter="1815">1814&#x2013;15</date>, he started composition in <date when="1818">1818</date>. 
                    In <date when="1822">1821&#x2013;22</date>, he published <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY1822"><hi rend="italic">Italy, a Poem: Part the First</hi></title> with the publisher <orgName corresp="#LONGMAN">Longman</orgName>, keeping the authorship anonymous 
                    (although the secret was exposed, to anyone who cared to investigate, by previous piecemeal appearance of portions of the work under <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s name, 
                    such as the lines on <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSPAESTUM"><placeName corresp="#PAESTUM">Paestum</placeName></title>, released in <date when="1819">1819</date> and <date when="1822">1822</date>). 
                    In <date when="1823">1823</date>, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> released the poem under his name in a new edition published by <orgName corresp="#MURRAY">John Murray</orgName>, 
                    which expanded and revised the contents of the <orgName corresp="#LONGMAN">Longman</orgName> <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY1822"><hi rend="italic">Part the First</hi></title>. 
                    Additionally, the first part went into a third edition, <date when="1823">1823</date>; and a fourth edition, with revisions, additions, and two woodcuts by <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>, <date when="1824">1824</date>. 
                    These constant revisions and reissues can be explained as the consequence of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s perfectionism, which he was able to gratify by means of his enormous wealth, 
                    and not necessarily as his response to the indifferent reception of the poem, as has sometimes been alleged. While <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> had the bad luck (or reckless daring) to begin composing a long verse work about <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> just at the time when 
                    <persName corresp="#GGB">Lord Byron</persName> wrote and published the fourth canto of <title type="poem" corresp="#BYRONPILGRIMAGE"><hi rend="italic">Childe Harold&#x02BC;s Pilgrimage</hi></title> (<date when="1818">1818</date>),

                    <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s poem did sell respectably. <persName corresp="#CP">Cecilia Powell</persName> has found a figure of 1,250 copies sold by <date when="1823-04">April 1823</date>, according to a ledger of that date in the <orgName corresp="#MURRAY">John Murray</orgName> archive;

                    The Ruskin family numbered among the exceptional, albeit not exclusive, owners of these earlier editions of the poem, having puchased a copy in 
                    <date when="1828">1828</date>&#x2014;presumably of the second part of the poem, issued in that year

                    <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s decision was a gamble, but an ingenious one that responded to rapid changes in the literary market that favored illustrated books.

                    because he was dismayed by the work&#x02BC;s tepid reception, reviewers having largely treated it coolly or ignored it altogether, 
                    or because he was eager to publish a new, combined and revised version of parts 1 and 2&#x2014;an extravagant approach to revision that was within his means&#x2014;his 
                    decision cannot have been unaffected by the precipitous change in conditions that had favored publication of poetry prior to the <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1829">later 1820s</date>. 
                    As <persName corresp="#LE">Lee Erickson</persName> has argued, in the first two decades of the century, the prestige of British poetry as a genre was supported by an economy of papermaking that 
                    kept the price of books high, thus encouraging consumers to favor a genre that repaid repeated reading of shorter works. Correspondingly, poets advanced a poetics 
                    that singled out an audience of the fit though few. This economy changed abruptly with industrial improvements that cheapened paper as well as making mass print runs possible through stereotyping. 
                    Now publishers encouraged a variety of genres, especially prose genres, in order to appeal to an audience expanding in both numbers and breadth of social class 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ERICKSONECONOMY"><persName corresp="#LE">Erickson</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#ERICKSONECONOMY"><hi rend="italic">Economy of Literary Form</hi></title></ref>, 19&#x2013;48). 
                    <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>, for all his refinement, elitism, and perfectionism&#x2014;indeed, in a certain respect by virtue of those traits&#x2014;was able 
                    to maintain the viability of his poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, by responding to the growing popular market 
                    as an entrepreneur. He did so by capitalizing on another technological innovation of the period, steel engraving, which made possible the mass production of the engraved image, 
                    and which in <persName corresp="#LE">Erickson</persName>&#x02BC;s view deflected what remained of the popular poetry market into the minor subgenre of light lyric and pictorial verse favored by the 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</ref> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ERICKSONECONOMY"><persName corresp="#LE">Erickson</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#ERICKSONECONOMY"><hi rend="italic">Economy of Literary Form</hi></title></ref>, 29&#x2013;31). The medium 
                    made possible two of the most widely distributed and steadily demanded illustrated books of the first half of the century, both by <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>, the 
                    <date when="1830">1830</date> illustrated edition of <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, and the

                        <p>The design element around which <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> organized these illustrated volumes was the engraved vignette, a feature that caught <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s eye 
                            when he came to imitate the <date when="1830">1830</date> illustrated <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> in compiling his own handmade illustrated travelogue, 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php"><title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</title></ref>. 
                            The vignette contributed to the appearance of an elite consumer item, while <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s investment put the volumes within reach of the middle class. 
                            Previously, however, the vignette had already accompanied a version of <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, which was published in the most ephemeral of print venues, the <hi rend="italic">pocket book</hi>. 
                    In <date notBefore="1824-10" notAfter="1824-11">late 1824</date>, there appeared a version of part 1 of the poem, with twelve copper engravings by <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>, 
                    published as the <title type="manual_guide" corresp="#ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</hi></title> for <date when="1825">1825</date>  
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POWELLTURNERSVIGNETTES"><persName corresp="#CP">Powell</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#POWELLTURNERSVIGNETTES">&#x201C;Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes&#x201D;</title></ref>, 2; and

                    This was not an edition of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s complete poem, but an adaptation accommodated to the pocket book, 
                    which combined features of an annual almanac with the function of a diary or engagement calendar. The 
                    <title type="manual_guide" corresp="#ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</hi></title> was an up&#x2010;market example of this kind 
                    of publication, with the almanac material refined to focus on fashionable information such as tables of the members of the British royalty and other dignitaries. 
                    The role played by <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s poem was to embellish the blank diary pages with brief verse extracts, 
                    illustrated by copper&#x2010;engraved vignettes by <persName corresp="#TSP">Thomas Stothard</persName>.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName> had been employed to illustrate the <title type="manual_guide" corresp="#ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</hi></title> 
                    since <date when="1783">1783</date>, prior to his first cuts for <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSPLEASURES"><hi rend="italic">Pleasures of Memory</hi></title>.

                    The publisher, <orgName corresp="#TBS">Thomas Baker</orgName> of <placeName corresp="#SOUTHAMPTON">Southampton</placeName>, appears to have relied on <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName> 
                    to impart the qualities that made this pocket book stand out in the market and maintain unusual longevity&#x2014;the thematizing of each annual issue around a work 
                    of popular British literature, sometimes classic, but most often modern. The literary illustrations were limited to twelve vignettes, each less than one by two inches, 
                    and each one heading the first of a two&#x2010;page spread of diary pages for a given month. Quotations from the literary work were limited to brief captions, 
                    effectively forming part of the vignette itself. Working within these limitations, <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName> pictorially serialized such hefty works 
                    as novels and long narrative poems by <persName corresp="#OG">Goldsmith</persName>, <persName corresp="#WCP">Cowper</persName>, <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName>, 
                    <persName corresp="#GCRABBE">Crabbe</persName>, <persName corresp="#TCAMPBELL">Campbell</persName>, and <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>

                    Evidence is unclear about what part, if any, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> himself played in the adaptation of 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> and his other poems to this ephemeral form of print culture. 
                    (<persName corresp="#AMH">Adele Holcomb</persName> asserts that <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> commissioned the pocket&#x2010;book vignettes

                <p>Production of pocket books converged with the rise of the annuals, suggesting how popular print culture in itself helped stage the success

                    Fashionable pocket books flourished from the <date notBefore="1770" notAfter="1799">final three decades of the eighteenth century</date> through the 
                    <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1850">first half of the nineteenth century</date>, while the first <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">illustrated literary annuals</ref>, 
                    which emerged in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, shared features of the pocket books such as almanac tables. 
                    <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName> probably commenced designing vignettes for the book&#x2010;length illustrated 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> as early as <date when="1826">1826</date>, 
                    only one year after the appearance of the pocket&#x2010;book version of the poem with its small vignettes by <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>

                    <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName> substituted architectural scenes for his usual figure illustrations, a subject more like <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s; 
                    and <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s text was placed more on a par with the illustrations, rather than serving merely as a prompt for the pictures. 
                    Whereas earlier layouts reduced the literary source to a series of brief captions to the pictures, the <date when="1825">1825</date> issue 
                    presented a facing&#x2010;page spread, with the verso embellished by an architectural vignette, and the facing recto (formerly blank, in earlier issues) presenting a text box 
                    containing a substantial verse extract, as compared with the mere captions incorporated into the illustrations for earlier issues

                    In <persName corresp="#TCP">Cadell</persName>, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> could rely on the experience of a publisher who for decades had successfully produced

                    elements of neoclassical design that suited the author&#x02BC;s taste and over which he exerted complete control. In the book&#x02BC;s design, as <persName corresp="#JPSCHOLAR">Jan Piggott</persName> suggests,

                    In that edition, poems were decorated with headpiece and tailpiece engravings by <persName corresp="#TBENGRAVER">Thomas Bewick</persName> 
                    (<date notBefore="1753" notAfter="1828">1753&#x2013;1828</date>) and <persName corresp="#JBE">John Bewick</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1760" notAfter="1795">1760&#x2013;95</date>). 
                    In <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, the headpieces typically feature <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s landscapes, 
                    while the tailpieces illustrate narrative episodes with <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>&#x02BC;s figures. The effect could not be achieved using older technologies 
                    employed by the Bewicks, however, since they engraved in wood, producing relief blocks that could be set along with the type, whereas steel engraving was an intaglio process. 
                    To achieve the neoclassical design using updated technology, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s printers devised a method for passing sheets through the press twice, 
                    once for caputuring the intaglio engraving, and once again for taking impressions from the relief type. The intaglio impression was taken first, 
                    and in such a way that the plate registration mark would be cut away with the trimmed pages

                <p><persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> exercised authoritarian control over the design and execution of every illustration, just as he obsessively revised almost every poem 
                    for the new edition (and persisted in developing <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> and other works for future editions of his poetry). 
                    <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> decided on the subjects of the illustrations and their treatment, and he demanded subtle alterations in their execution, 
                    even if the laborious steel engraving was already underway. The artists and engravers were compliant, with <persName corresp="JMWT">Turner</persName> relinquishing his instinct for drama 
                    in favor of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s neoclassicism, and allowing <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>&#x02BC;s figures to be placed in his landscapes,

                    Even the printer probably did not escape <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s supervision, who was known to descend on printshops and stir

                    As critics have remarked, however, if <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> was exacting in his demands, he and his collaborators were sympathetically well matched in their approach to the subject. 
                    <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>&#x02BC;s cheery representation of childhood and his idealized view of feminine grace clearly appealed to <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s taste

                    and <persName corresp="JMWT">Turner</persName>, while sharing <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s reverence for the antiquity of <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>, 
                    shrewdly offset his patron&#x02BC;s tendency to mire his poetry in historical pedantry, and instead complemented the poems with topographical interest that the poet neglected

                <p>The result is a happy collaboration of writer and artists that both embodies the technological advances and the changing literary markets of the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</date>,
