                <p>By the early twentieth century, when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poems about <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glenfarg</geogName> had become available in print,

                    touted how the route had been highlighted by northbound celebrity travelers, ranging from the young <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>

                    In the <date when="1908">1908</date> edition of the guidebook, the glen is credited with having drawn forth the young <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;descriptive powers&#x201D; 
                    when he passed through the valley &#x201C;on a winter&#x02BC;s day when the rocks were hung with icicles&#x201D;. This allusion to Ruskin&#x02BC;s poem is expanded in a later edition of the guidebook (ca. <date calendar="1930">1930s</date>),

                    In the <date when="1840">1840s</date>, the Farg was still active with four mills for grinding corn, twenty&#x2010;two thrashing mills, and a sawmill.
