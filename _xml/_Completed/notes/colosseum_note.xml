                <p>The <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> was a vast structure built 
                    <date notBefore="1824" notAfter="1826">1824&#x2013;26</date> to house an ambitious circular, painted panorama of <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, 
                    along with other entertainments. The panorama was based on drawings by <persName corresp="#THP">Thomas Hornor</persName> (<date notBefore="1785" notAfter="1844">1785&#x2013;1844</date>), 
                    a multi&#x2010;talented surveyor, cartographer, and landscape designer. <persName corresp="#THP">Hornor</persName> made his drawings circa <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1823">1820&#x2013;23</date>, 
                    while daringly housed atop scaffolding erected at the summit of <placeName type="building" corresp="#STPAULCATHEDRAL">St. Paul&#x02BC;s Cathedral</placeName>.
                    The drawings were transferred to canvas by the painter, <persName corresp="#ETP">E. T. Parris</persName>, who worked section by section on an enormous canvas stretched 
                    inside the <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName> dome. The sections were then painted by <persName corresp="#ETP">Parris</persName> 
                    along with other artists between <date notBefore="1825" notAfter="1829">1825 and 1829</date>. The completed work was believed to be &#x201C;in effect the largest 
                    oil painting the world had ever seen&#x201D;, exhibited inside &#x201C;the largest [dome] in the land&#x201D;, which was &#x201C;even larger than that on 
                    <placeName type="building" corresp="#STPAULCATHEDRAL">St. Paul&#x02BC;s</placeName>, as . . . proprietors never tired of telling their public&#x201D;. 
                    Inside the dome, visitors were able to view the panorama by ascending to a lower sight level and to an upper sight level, reached either by stairs or by an &#x201C;ascending room&#x201D;&#x2014;the city&#x02BC;s 
                    first passenger elevator. In order to raise funds, the panorama exhibition opened prematurely in <date when="1829">1829</date>, before the painting and other exhibits 
                    were quite finished, and the project would not be fully realized in its first instantiation until <date when="1832">1832</date>. Soon after the opening 
                    in <date when="1829">1829</date>, <persName corresp="#THP">Hornor</persName> went bankrupt and fled to <placeName corresp="#USA">America</placeName>,

                    Based on the diorama in <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName> invented by <persName corresp="#LJMD">Louis&#x2010;Jacques&#x2010;Mand&#x00E9; Daguerre</persName> (<date notBefore="1787" notAfter="1851">1787&#x2013;1851</date>) 
                    and an architectural painter, <persName corresp="#CMB">Charles Bouton</persName>, the <placeName type="building" corresp="#LONDONDIORAMA">London Diorama</placeName> theater 
                    was designed by the artist and architectural illustrator, <persName corresp="#ACP">Auguste Charles Pugin</persName> (<date notBefore="1768" notAfter="1832">1768/9&#x2013;1832</date>,

                    Its effects were achieved by manipulating light reflected off an opaque painting and refracted through a transparency. The auditorium, in which observers were seated,

                <p>In responding to these spectacles, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> touched tangentially on one of the great metropolitan building projects of his parents&#x02BC; generation, 
                    <persName corresp="#JN">John Nash</persName>&#x02BC;s (<date notBefore="1752" notAfter="1835">1752&#x2013;1835</date>) <placeName corresp="#REGENTSPARK">Regent&#x02BC;s Park</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#REGENTSTREET">Regent Street</placeName>, 
                    and their associated buildings. The <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName> was built in the southwest corner of 
                    <placeName corresp="#REGENTSPARK">Regent&#x02BC;s Park</placeName>, between two of <persName corresp="#JN">Nash</persName>&#x02BC;s terraces lining the outer drive of the park. 
                    In keeping with the neoclassical terraces, the <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName> was designed by <persName corresp="#DB">Decimus Burton</persName> 
                    (<date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1881">1800&#x2013;1881</date>) in Greek Revival style&#x2014;specifically, modeled on the <name type="building" corresp="#PANTHEON">Pantheon</name> in <placeName corresp="#ROME">Rome</placeName>

                <p>As architect to the <persName corresp="#KG4">Prince Regent</persName>, <persName corresp="#JN">Nash</persName> conceived a vision for transforming <placeName corresp="#MARYLEBONE">Marylebone</placeName>, 
                    a country park on the northern edge of <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, into a new urban residential park for the city. <persName corresp="#JN">Nash</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    plans were informed by the taste for the picturesque, which his former partner, the landscape designer <persName corresp="#HR">Humphry Repton</persName> (<date notBefore="1752" notAfter="1818">1752&#x2013;1818</date>), 
                    had promoted in giving shape to numerous estates (albeit while embroiled in controversy with theorists of the picturesque, <persName corresp="#UP">Uvedale Price</persName> [<date notBefore="1747" notAfter="1829">1747&#x2013;1829</date>] 
                    and <persName corresp="#RPK">Richard Payne Knight</persName> [<date notBefore="1751" notAfter="1824">1751&#x2013;1824</date>]). <persName corresp="#JN">Nash</persName> 
                    complemented these park settings with picturesque cottages and villas in a wide range of styles, from structures that he modeled on a &#x201C;picture&#x201D; in the strict sense 
                    of drawing inspiration from structures depicted in the Italian campagna scenes by <persName corresp="#CLAUDE">Claude Lorrain</persName>; to irregular, castellated dwellings; 
                    to thatch cottages; and most exotically, to the &#x201C;Indian&#x201D; forms of <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRIGHTONPAVILION">Brighton Pavilion</placeName>, 
                    which he conceived for the <persName corresp="#KG4">Prince Regent</persName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SUMMERSONARCHITECTUREINBRITAIN"><persName corresp="#JSUMMERSON">Summerson</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Architecture of Britain</hi></ref>, 288&#x2013;94).</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#JN">Nash</persName> brought the picturesque to bear on city planning with the <placeName corresp="#REGENTSPARK">Regent&#x02BC;s Park</placeName> project, 
                    begun in wartime, in <date notBefore="1811" notAfter="1812">1811&#x2013;12</date>, prior to <date when="1815-06-18">Waterloo</date> and the end of the 
                    <date notBefore="1799-11-09" notAfter="1815-06-18">Napoleonic Wars</date>. Rather than simply extending the city to cover the space formerly belonging to <placeName corresp="#MARYLEBONE">Marylebone</placeName>, 
                    <persName corresp="#JN">Nash</persName> landscaped the park as a picturesque setting to showcase (yet another) palace for the <persName corresp="#KG4">Prince Regent</persName>, 
                    as well as a grand church to serve as a &#x201C;Valhalla&#x201D; for the nation&#x02BC;s heroes. These structures were never realized, but more significantly the plan 
                    sponsored the design and construction of numerous urban villas&#x2014;a new kind of urban residence set in Reptonian picturesque landscaping, 
                    each villa invisible to its neighbor. Some of the first of these villas were designed by <persName corresp="#DB">Decimus Burton</persName>, the architect of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName>, 
                    whose work spanned a wide range of what could be considered a villa&#x2014;so wide that <persName corresp="#DA">Dana Arnold</persName> characterizes <persName corresp="#DB">Burton</persName>&#x02BC;s ideas as 
                    &#x201C;a state of mind as . . . [the houses] offered their occupants a retreat from the rigours of life in the metropolis&#x201D;

                    was conceived by its backers as &#x201C;a kind of public counterpart of <placeName type="building" corresp="#CARLTONHOUSE">Carlton House</placeName>, the sumptuous mansion . . .

                    <p><persName corresp="#THP">Hornor</persName>&#x02BC;s panorama and <persName corresp="#ACP">Pugin</persName>&#x02BC;s  diorama were located in <placeName type="building" corresp="#REGENTSPARK">Regent&#x02BC;s Park</placeName> 
                    because their creators and backers believed that their spectacles would command a sophisticated audience. Among their predecessors, <persName corresp="#PJdeL">Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg</persName> exhibited 
                    his ediophusikon exclusively to a genteel public, and <persName corresp="#RBARKER">Robert Barker</persName> and his son and associates maintained the 
                    <placeName type="building" corresp="#LEICESTERSQPANORAMA">Leicester Square Panorama</placeName> as a respectable entertainment from <date notBefore="1793" notAfter="1863">1793 to 1863</date>. 
                    Although <persName corresp="#RDA">Altick</persName> traces a decline in the kind and quality of entertainment that successive proprietors of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName> 
                    offered over the years, these institutions were founded with pretensions of advancing their respective arts of scenic representation, and they claimed a place in the heritage 
                    of the fine arts in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>.</p>
                        
                        <p>However <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have responded to such claims, his youthful encounters 
                    with the Old Masters&#x2014;if only with their names and copies of their works&#x2014;occurred at these exhibitions as well as in art galleries at home and abroad. 
                    Like other visitors to the <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName>, he entered its imposing Doric portico and passed through 
                    &#x201C;a spacious rotunda called &#x2018;the Saloon of the Arts&#x2019; or &#x2018;the Hall of Sculpture&#x2019;. Here, by invitation of the 
                    &#x2018;committee of management&#x2019; (<persName corresp="#THP">Hornor&#x02BC;s</persName> creditors), &#x2018;professors of the ingenious and fine arts&#x2019; exhibited their works. 
                    Alongside recent productions there stood casts of <persName corresp="#PHIDIAS">Phidias</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="artwork" corresp="#PHIDIASDIANA"><hi rend="italic">Diana</hi></title>, 
                    the <title type="artwork" corresp="#VENUSDEMEDICI"><hi rend="italic">Venus de Medici</hi></title>, the <title type="artwork" corresp="#APOLLOBELVEDERE"><hi rend="italic">Apollo Belvedere</hi></title>, 
                    <persName corresp="#AC">Canova</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="artwork" corresp="#ACTHREEGRACES"><hi rend="italic">Three Graces</hi></title>, and replicas of 
                    <persName corresp="#MAA">Michelangelo</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="artwork" corresp="#MAAMOSES"><hi rend="italic">Moses</hi></title> and 
                    <title type="artwork" corresp="#MAALORENZODIPIERODEMEDICI"><hi rend="italic">Lorenzo of the Medicis</hi></title>&#x201D;. Similarly, audiences in the darkened auditorium 
                    of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#LONDONDIORAMA">Diorama</placeName>, while awaiting the illumination, could gaze up at the &#x201C;ceiling of transparent fabric 
                    painted in colors, with portraits of <persName corresp="#SJR">Reynolds</persName>, <persName corresp="#BWRA">West</persName>, <persName corresp="#NP">Poussin</persName>, 
                    <persName corresp="#JIvanR">Ruisdael</persName>, <persName corresp="#RvanR">Rembrandt</persName>, <persName corresp="#CJV">Vernet</persName>,

                    a combined pantheon of Old Masters and modern British ones was invoked to consecrate this latest attempt to expand the boundaries of fine art&#x201D;
