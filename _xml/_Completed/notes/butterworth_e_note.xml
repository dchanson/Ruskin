                <p><persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName> held the post of writing master and accountant at the <orgName corresp="#RHSE">Royal High School</orgName>, <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName>, 
                    the institution in which <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> enrolled in <date when="1795">1795</date> at age ten. 
                    <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName> was appointed to the post in <date when="1780-08">August 1780</date> on the merits of &#x201C;the elegance of his penmanship&#x201D; and &#x201C;his success as a teacher&#x201D;, 
                    having previously taught writing and arithmetic <date notBefore="1773" notAfter="1780-08">since 1773</date> at <orgName corresp="#DUMFRIESACADEMY">Dumfries Academy</orgName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#STEVENEDINBURGHHIGHSCHOOL"><persName corresp="#WSTEVEN">Steven</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#STEVENEDINBURGHHIGHSCHOOL"><hi rend="italic">History of the High School of Edinburgh</hi></title></ref>, 128; app. 6, p. 120). 
                    He proudly advertised his office on the title page of his first&#x2010;published copybook, <title type="book" corresp="#BUTTERWORTHUNIVERSALPENMAN"><hi rend="italic">The Universal Penman; or The Beauties of Writing Delineated</hi></title>, 
                    which appeared in <date when="1785">1785</date>, printed in <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName> &#x201C;for the Author &#x0026; G. Robinson&#x201D;

                    <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> would not have been instructed personally by <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName>, since the master resigned in <date when="1793-08">August 1793</date> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#STEVENEDINBURGHHIGHSCHOOL">Steven, <title corresp="#STEVENEDINBURGHHIGHSCHOOL"><hi rend="italic">History of the High School of Edinburgh</hi></title></ref>, app. 6, p. 120).</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName> must have brought unusual distinction to the post of writing master. Since the earliest days of the <orgName corresp="#RHSE">Royal High School</orgName>, 
                    the class in writing had been considered optional at this institution devoted primarily to study of classics; 
                    and in <date when="1704">1704</date> the school authorities felt compelled to intervene in order to assure that the writing master was 
                    &#x201C;properly countenanced&#x201D;, by urging the Latin masters to &#x201C;use their best endeavours to get more constant employment to . . . the teacher of writing&#x201D;. 
                    The prestige of the post had not improved later in the century, when <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName> was appointed to succeed an &#x201C;eccentric person&#x201D; who had deserted the school. 
                    Instruction in writing included basic arithmetic until <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1828">1827&#x2013;28</date>, when greater dignity was bestowed on this part of the curriculum by combining its study with mathematics. 
                    This reform was part of an expansion and liberalization of the overall curriculum, although writing and arithmetic remained optional classes, allowing for students to obtain this instruction elsewhere 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#STEVENEDINBURGHHIGHSCHOOL"><persName corresp="#WSTEVEN">Steven</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#STEVENEDINBURGHHIGHSCHOOL"><hi rend="italic">History of the High School of Edinburgh</hi></title></ref>, 80&#x2013;81, 128, 227).</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName> designed his copybook, <title type="book" corresp="#BUTTERWORTHUNIVERSALPENMAN"><hi rend="italic">The Universal Penman; or The Beauties of Writing Delineated</hi></title>, according to its title page, 
                    for the &#x201C;improvement of youth&#x201D; and &#x201C;amusement of the curious&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HEALENGLISHWRITINGMASTERS"><persName corresp="#AHEAL">Heal</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HEALENGLISHWRITINGMASTERS"><hi rend="italic">English Writing&#x2010;Masters</hi></title></ref>, 193). The main title, 
                    <title type="book" corresp="#BUTTERWORTHUNIVERSALPENMAN"><hi rend="italic">The Universal Penman</hi></title>, was shared with that of an older, well&#x2010;known copybook by <persName corresp="#GBE">George Bickham</persName> (<date notBefore="1684" notAfter="1758">1684&#x2013;1758</date>) 
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="hand_note.php">Ruskin&#x02BC;s Handwriting</ref>). Nonetheless, another edition of <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName>&#x02BC;s text 
                    was published in <date when="1799">1799</date> in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> by <orgName corresp="#LANDW">Laurie and Whittle</orgName> (p. 25). As was typical for publication of copybooks 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BECKERPRACTICEOFLETTERS"><persName corresp="#DPBECKER">Becker</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#BECKERPRACTICEOFLETTERS"><hi rend="italic">Practice of Letters</hi></title></ref>, xiii), 
                    this firm was a print publisher specializing in maps, charts, 
                    and other pictorial prints. <orgName corresp="#LANDW">Laurie and Whittle</orgName> also maintained a Hibernian connection, the firm being headed by the Scottish engraver, 
                    <persName corresp="#RL">Robert Laurie</persName> (<date notBefore="1755" notAfter="1836">1755?&#x2013;1836</date>), who developed a method 
                    of printing colored mezzotints (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LAURIEDNB"><persName corresp="#TCLAYTON">Clayton</persName> and <persName corresp="#AMCCONNELL">McConnell</persName>, <title type="dictionary_entry" corresp="#LAURIEDNB">&#x201C;Laurie, Robert (<date notBefore="1755" notAfter="1836">1755?&#x2013;1836&#x201D;</date></title></ref>).</p>
                <p>According to <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HEALENGLISHWRITINGMASTERS"><persName corresp="#AHEAL">Heal</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HEALENGLISHWRITINGMASTERS"><hi rend="italic">English Writing&#x2010;Masters</hi></title></ref>, 
                        <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName> produced six additional titles by <date notBefore="1799" notAfter="1801">1799&#x2013;1801</date>, with the book that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> used, 
                    the <title type="book" corresp="#BUTTERWORTHYOUNGARITHMETICIAN"><hi rend="italic">Young Arthmetician&#x02BC;s Instructor</hi></title>, 
                    appearing in <date when="1805">1805</date>. In addition, the &#x201C;firm&#x201D; of <orgName corresp="#EDBSON">Butterworth &#x0026; Son</orgName> 
                    produced &#x201C;several copy&#x2010;books from <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1827">1800&#x2013;1827</date> and possibly later&#x201D; (pp. 25, 193). 
                    Thus, the firm remained in business in <date when="1827">1827</date>, the year in which <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> purchased the 
                    <title type="book" corresp="#BUTTERWORTHYOUNGARITHMETICIAN"><hi rend="italic">Young Arthmetician&#x02BC;s Instructor</hi></title>, 
                    and also the year in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first used pen and ink and presumably began to learn round hand
