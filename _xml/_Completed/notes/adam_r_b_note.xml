                <p><persName corresp="#RBA">Robert Borthwick Adam II</persName> of <placeName corresp="#BUFFALO">Buffalo, New York</placeName>, inherited and dramatically expanded the book collection of his uncle,

                    and established a successful and respected dry goods business in <placeName corresp="#BUFFALO">Buffalo</placeName>, which he expanded to a major department store. 
                    The senior <persName corresp="#RBAI">Adam</persName> and his wife being childless, they adopted his namesake nephew, then nine, and his sister from <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>. 
                    For both father and son, the main focus of the book collection was <persName corresp="#SJ">Samuel Johnson</persName> and his circle, 
                    but <persName corresp="#RBAI">Adam</persName> senior collected other writers, including <persName corresp="#RBURNS">Robert Burns</persName> and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>; 
                    and while it was the <persName corresp="#SJ">Johnson</persName> collection that earned the Adamses of <placeName corresp="#BUFFALO">Buffalo</placeName> world&#x2010;wide fame, 
                    <persName corresp="#RBA">Adam II</persName> remained committed also to the <persName corresp="#RBURNS">Burns</persName> and <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> until about <date notBefore="1923" notAfter="1924">1923&#x2013;24</date>

                <p>In the <date notBefore="1920" notAfter="1929">1920s</date>, <persName corresp="#RBA">Adam II</persName> decided to sell his <persName corresp="#RBURNS">Burns</persName> and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collections, in order to devote his attention solely 
                    to <persName corresp="#SJ">Johnson</persName> and the eighteenth century. (Tragically, he would be forced by the stock market crash of <date when="1929-10">October 1929</date> 
                    to break up his <persName corresp="#SJ">Johnson</persName> collection, as well.) In <date when="1923">1923</date>, he sent the <title type="archive" corresp="#RBARUSKINCOLLECTION"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection</title> to the firm of the rare book and manuscript dealer, 
                    <persName corresp="#ASWR">A. S. W. Rosenbach</persName> (<date notBefore="1876" notAfter="1952">1876&#x2013;1952</date>) in <placeName corresp="#NEWYORK">New York</placeName>. The firm attempted to interest <persName corresp="#HEH">Henry Huntington</persName> (<date notBefore="1850" notAfter="1927">1850&#x2013;1927</date>) in the collection, 
                    but it remained unsold for six years, when, in <date when="1929-04">April 1929</date>, <persName corresp="#RBA">Adam</persName> retrieved it for presentation to <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale University Library</orgName>. 
                    He donated the collection in memory of his adopted father, who started it, but he also wished to support the efforts 
                    by his good friend, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="tinker_c_b_note.php">Chauncey B. Tinker (<date notBefore="1876" notAfter="1963">1876&#x2013;1963</date>)</ref>,

                <p>In a <date when="1929">1929</date> issue of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#YALEGAZETTE"><hi rend="italic">Yale University Library Gazette</hi></title>, the <title type="archive" corresp="#RBARUSKINCOLLECTION"><persName corresp="#RBA">Adam</persName> <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection</title> was described as constituting 
                    &#x201C;virtually the whole body of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s works, from the earliest to the latest, just as they were first issued: 
                    <hi rend="italic">editiones principes</hi> literally by the score, rare pamphlets, 
                    occasional addresses, unique copies,&#x2014;everything that might be needed . . . for the professional scholar 
                    bent upon a thorough and serious study in the works of <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName>&#x201D;. The article acknowledged, however, 
                    that <persName corresp="#RBA">Adam</persName> had previously sold off &#x201C;some of the rarest items&#x201D;, including two copies of the 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1850_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1850"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> (<date when="1850">1850</date>)</ref>, 
                    as well as &#x201C;several autograph letters and manuscripts, which added luster to Mr. <persName corresp="#RBA">Adam</persName>&#x02BC;s library, but had no essential place,
                    perhaps, in the collection that has just been given to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>&#x201D;. The article ascribes the sale of these <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> items, 
                    not to the <orgName corresp="#THEROSENBACH">Rosenbach firm</orgName>, but to an auction at the <orgName corresp="#ANDERSONGALLERIES">Anderson Galleries</orgName> in <date when="1926-02">February 1926</date>&#x2014;a major disposal of over 400 lots 
                    of non&#x2010;Johnsonian materials and some Johnsonian, of which 38 items related to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, according to the <title type="periodical" corresp="#YALEGAZETTE"><hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi></title> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRENCHADAMCOLLECTION"><persName corresp="#RDFRENCH">French</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#FRENCHADAMCOLLECTION">&#x201C;The R. B. Adam Collection of Ruskin&#x201D;</title></ref>, 1, 6; 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HYDEADAMTINKERNEWTON1"><persName corresp="#MHYDE">Hyde</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HYDEADAMTINKERNEWTON1">&#x201C;Adam, Tinker, and Newton&#x201D;</title></ref>, 298). 
                    The relation of these offerings in <date when="1926">1926</date> to what had been turned over to <persName corresp="#ASWR">Rosenbach</persName> in <date when="1923">1923</date> is not clear.</p>
                
                <p>Nonetheless, the remaining collection given to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> was so large that the annual <title type="periodical" corresp="#KEOGHREPORT">&#x201C;Report of the Librarian&#x201D;</title> for <date notBefore="1928" notAfter="1929">1928&#x2013;29</date> 
                    reflected difficulty getting a grip on the numbers of items. First listed in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#KEOGHREPORT">&#x201C;Report&#x201D;</title> as consisting of 
                    &#x201C;over three hundred and seventy volumes by and about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x201D;, elsewhere in the same annual report 
                    the gift is numbered at &#x201C;some 500 volumes and pamphlets&#x201D;. Six years later, &#x201C;after an unusual amount of bibliographical study and revision&#x201D;, 
                    another annual <title type="periodical" corresp="#KEOGHREPORT">&#x201C;Report&#x201D;</title> set the total at &#x201C;464 volumes and 271 pamphlets&#x201D;, although it is unclear whether these figures refer solely to the <persName corresp="#RBA">Adam</persName> bequest 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#KEOGHREPORT_1928-29"><title type="periodical" corresp="#KEOGHREPORT">&#x201C;Report of the Librarian</title>, July 1, 1928&#x2013;June 30, 1929&#x201D;</ref>, 6, 36&#x2013;37; 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#KEOGHREPORT_1934-35"><title type="periodical" corresp="#KEOGHREPORT">&#x201C;Report of the Librarian</title>, July 1, 1934&#x2013;June 30, 1935&#x201D;</ref>, 15).</p>
                
                <p>Like <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName>, <persName corresp="#RBA">Adam</persName> was generous to scholars who requested access to his collections for research. <persName corresp="#SJ">Johnson</persName> scholars in particular 
                    benefited from access to and even loan of his possessions, so it is possible that scholars may have taken advantage 
                    of <persName corresp="#RBA">Adam</persName>&#x02BC;s <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection as well, before it came to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>. <persName corresp="#CGO">Charles Grosvenor Osgood</persName> (<date notBefore="1871" notAfter="1964">1871&#x2013;1964</date>), 
                    the literary scholar from <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton University</orgName>, visited <persName corresp="#RBA">Adam</persName> and lectured on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in <placeName corresp="#BUFFALO">Buffalo</placeName>; 
                    and <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName>&#x02BC;s graduate students were granted access to <persName corresp="#RBA">Adam</persName>&#x02BC;s collections as well 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HYDEADAMTINKERNEWTON1"><persName corresp="#MHYDE">Hyde</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HYDEADAMTINKERNEWTON1">&#x201C;Adam, Tinker, and Newton&#x201D;</title></ref>, 290&#x2013;92, 294&#x2013;96).</p>
