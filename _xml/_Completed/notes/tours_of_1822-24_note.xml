                <p>Prior to <date when="1822">1822</date>, the Ruskins would have traveled little for pleasure. In <date when="1822-01">January 1822</date>, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>
                    wrote with pleasure to <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> about their journey together as a newly married couple in <date when="1818">1818</date>, 
                    coming from <placeName corresp="#LEICESTER">Leicester</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#STAMFORD">Stamford</placeName>, where they stayed at the ancient <placeName corresp="#GEORGEINN">George Inn</placeName>.
                    In reply, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> referred briefly to a holiday in the <persName corresp="#KENT">Kent</persName> seaside town of <placeName corresp="#SANDGATE">Sandgate</placeName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 104, 105n, 107; 
                    and see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="seaside_resorts_note.php"><placeName corresp="#SEASIDE">Seaside Resorts</placeName></ref> for the Ruskins&#x02BC; attraction to these places).</p>
                <p>The earliest family tours to be reflected directly in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s juvenilia
                    are discussed in <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tours_of_1826-27_note.php">Tours of <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1827">1826&#x2013;27</date></ref>; the present note
                    concerns tours known mainly by family tradition.</p>
                <p>In a <date notBefore="1822-02-23" notAfter="1822-02-24">23&#x2013;24 February 1822</date> letter to <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>
                    eloquently describes the charms of the &#x201C;beautiful Ride . . . , differing from if not excelling all other Rides,&#x201D; between
                    <placeName corresp="#WARWICK">Warwick</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#COVENTRY">Coventry</placeName> and including <placeName corresp="#KENILWORTH">Kenilworth</placeName>, which he
                    hopes &#x201C;to view . . . with my Love some summers day&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 118). 
                    That the family did undertake a tour in <date when="1822">1822</date>, perhaps sometime between 
                    <date notBefore="1822-05" notAfter="1822-09">May and September</date>, is supported by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s
                    remark to <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="prout_samuel_note.php"><persName corresp="#SP">Samuel Prout (<date notBefore="1783" notAfter="1852">1783&#x2013;1852</date>)</persName></ref>, 
                    albeit made over two decades later in a letter of <date when="1844-04-29">29 April 1844</date>, 
                    that he had been &#x2018;born <hi rend="italic">again</hi>, <date notBefore="1822-02-08" notAfter="1823-02-07">at three years old</date>,&#x2019; among the

                    adding a religious association to experiences that his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1822">1822</date> letter had characterized 
                    solely in terms of the picturesque.</p>
                <p>If a tour comprising the <geogName corresp="#MIDLANDS">Midlands</geogName> and <placeName corresp="#CUMBERLAND">Cumberland</placeName> was ambitious enough for a family with a three&#x2010;year&#x2010;old, 
                    the itinerary may have extended to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>, 
                    as <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName> points out. According to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> writing decades later in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, 
                    this leg of the journey was reached by water:
                    &#x201C;I had gone to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> in <persName corresp="#CS">Captain Spinks</persName>&#x02BC;s cutter, then a regular passage boat, when I was only
                    <date notBefore="1822-02-08" notAfter="1823-02-07">three years old</date>&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 35:105; 
                    see also <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 11920 n. 1).</p>
                <p>It is possible that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was referring to a steam cutter, steam travel for passengers and tourism having been available in <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> since <date when="1812">1812</date>, 
                    when the first commercial steamboat in <geogName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</geogName>, the <hi rend="italic">Comet</hi>, began operating on the <geogName corresp="#CLYDERIVER">Clyde River</geogName>. Of the 141 steam vessels 
                    built in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> by <date when="1822">1822</date>, 23 operated off the east coast of <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#TOURISMANDIDENTITY"><persName corresp="#KHGRENIER">Grenier</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#GRENIERTOURISMANDIDENTITY"><hi rend="italic">Tourism and Identity in <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName></hi></title></ref>, 60; 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BAINPERTHSTEAM"><persName corresp="#JCBAIN">Bain</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#BAINPERTHSTEAM">&#x201C;Perth Steam Packet Company&#x201D;</title></ref>, 411). Whether the Ruskins&#x02BC; journey was by steam or sail, 
                    a journey to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> by water was not unlikely, 
                    since trade conditions during the <date notBefore="1799-11-09" notAfter="1815-06-18">Napoleonic War</date> encouraged the development of company&#x2010;owned &#x201C;lines&#x201D; of coastal vessels 
                    in competition with independent vessels&#x2014;one such company being especially germane to the Ruskins&#x02BC; northern destination, 
                    the <orgName corresp="#DP&#x0026;L">Dundee, <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> &#x0026; <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>perth Shipping Company</orgName>, which carried passengers as well as cargo. 
                    Scholarship on this line includes mention of a <persName corresp="#SPINKS">Captain Spinks</persName> who, like many of the experienced captains chosen to effect the company&#x02BC;s transition from sail to steam, 
                    had difficulties maneuvering the comparatively unmanageable steam &#x201C;smacks&#x201D; (i.e., coastal cutters), and this <persName corresp="#SPINKS">Spinks</persName> 
                    was formally admonished for repeatedly incurring damage to his steam smack, the <placeName corresp="#PERTH"><hi rend="italic">Perth</hi></placeName> throughout <date notBefore="1836" notAfter="1837">1836&#x2013;37</date>
                    from collisions that included running over an oyster fishing smack 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JACKSONTRANSFERTOSTEAM"><persName corresp="#GJACKSON">Jackson</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#JACKSONTRANSFERTOSTEAM">&#x201C;Operational Problems of the Transfer to Steam&#x201D;</title></ref>, 154&#x2013;55, 165).</p>
                <p>There is in addition a tradition that the family visited the <geogName corresp="#LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</geogName> in <date when="1824">1824</date> <!--Entry needed here.-->. 
                    This journey may be associated with one to <ref type="note" subtype="geographical" target="perth_note.php"><placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName></ref> since 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s uncle, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_patrick_note.php"><persName corresp="#PR">Patrick Richardson</persName></ref>,
                    died on <date when="1824-07-20">July 20 of that year</date>, although a family tour may have been underway or even completed by that time of the <date notBefore="1824-06-21" notAfter="1824-09-22">summer</date>.</p>
