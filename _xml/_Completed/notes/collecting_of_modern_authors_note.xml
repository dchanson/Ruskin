                <p>Interest in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early works 
                    belongs to a larger <date notBefore="1870" notAfter="1900">fin de si&#x00E8;cle</date> phenomenon in book collecting whereby collectors turned
                    their attention to modern (i.e., <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date>) authors rather than
                    to incunabula and fine typography and illustration, which had preoccupied
                    collectors earlier in the century. Author societies, such as those dedicated to
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <persName corresp="#RB">Robert Browning</persName>, and <persName corresp="#PBS">Percy Shelley</persName>,
                    organized study of every aspect of their authors&#x02BC; lives and works; and
                    supporting this activity, industrious bibliographers, editors, publishers, and
                    booksellers produced reprints and editions of canonical modern authors&#x02BC;
                    works, including juvenilia, along with enumerative or descriptive bibliographies
                    detailing the authors&#x02BC; publications 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CARTERTASTEANDTECHNIQUE"><persName corresp="#JC">Carter</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#CARTERTASTEANDTECHNIQUE"><hi rend="italic">Taste and Technique in Book&#x2010;Collecting</hi></title></ref>, 22).

                    <head type="section">Collectors&#x02BC; &#x201C;Mania&#x201D; for Modern First Editions and Juvenilia, and the Activity of Literary Forgers</head>
                    <p>The aim was to
                        collect a run of an author&#x02BC;s publications that was complete, down to the
                        most minor and fugitive items, and that exhibited each item in its original
                        material condition. These goals led to collectors&#x02BC; competitive search for
                        rare books (causing a rise in market prices). The juvenilia and youthful writing
                        of modern authors&#x2014;what were called <hi rend="italic">early editions</hi>&#x2014;acquired a cachet owing to their extreme scarcity. This
                        goal of comprehensiveness in collecting was controversial, as collectors appeared to place
                        exaggerated value on an author&#x02BC;s minor works. Publishers were suspected of
                        encouraging an interest in juvenilia, since the desire could be met with
                        reprints of works that were out of copyright or appeared to be neglected. Yet, despite these competitive incentives and keenness for the hunt, another
                        significant motivation for collectors&#x02BC; interest in youthful writing lay in a &#x201C;sentiment&#x201D;
                        strongly attached to these early editions in their original condition, and to juvenilia in particular. This sentiment likewise proved fraught and
                        controversial.

                    <p>In historical accounts of the <date notBefore="1880-06-20" notAfter="1901-01-22">late&#x2010;Victorian</date> collecting of modern authors, 
                        the less savory, competitive motivations of collectors were foregrounded, 
                        because these motivations were blamed for creating opportunities for literary forgers. In the overheated rare book market of the last decades of the century, 
                        it was all too easy to fool buyers with spurious editions of lesser known works by prolific <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date> authors. Most notoriously, 
                        <persName corresp="#HBF">Henry Buxton Forman</persName> (<date notBefore="1842" notAfter="1917">1842&#x2013;1917</date>) hit upon the

                        heretofore &#x201C;undiscovered&#x201D; publications by modern authors in the
                        single&#x2010;author bibliographies and &#x201C;bio&#x2010;bibliographical&#x201D;
                        essays that catered to the fevered collecting interests of the period. Typically
                        described as small pamphlets, these publications never existed, but the genius
                        of the scam lay in the possibility of their existence, and in the convincingly
                        faked bibliographical descriptions that backed up their alleged histories. With this foundation laid, <persName corresp="#TJW">Wise</persName> and <persName corresp="#HBF">Forman</persName> then
                        arranged for the pamphlets&#x02BC; forgery and their insinuation onto the market 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#COLLINSTWOFORGERS"><persName corresp="#JCC">Collins</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#COLLINSTWOFORGERS"><hi rend="italic">Two Forgers</hi></title></ref>, 43, 82). A spectacular
                        and daring example of these &#x201C;creative forgeries&#x201D; was <persName corresp="#EBB">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</persName>&#x02BC;s alleged private printing 
                        in <date when="1847">1847</date> of the <title type="poem" corresp="#BARRETTBROWNINGSONNETS"><hi rend="italic">Sonnets from the Portuguese</hi></title> as a
                        gift for <persName corresp="#RB">Robert</persName>, a story that was fabricated
                        by <persName corresp="#TJW">Wise</persName> and <persName corresp="#HBF">Forman</persName>, and that they followed up with forged physical copies for
                        auction.
                    </p>
                    <p>Modern authors&#x02BC; youthful works proved a ready target for such
                        fabrications, owing to the relative ease of inventing a tale about the origins
                        of a previously little known edition of a juvenile work that was itself obscure. As
                        it turned out, the editors of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JKRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title></ref> of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title>,

                        were among the first to spot these spurious
                        claims. They detected the improbability of the alleged &#x201C;<date when="1868">1868</date>&#x201D; pamphlet of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s
                        juvenile prose tale, <ref type="apparatus" target="leoni_apparatus.php"><title type="story" corresp="#JRLEONI">&#x201C;Leoni&#x201D;</title></ref>, as well as of the

                        and other pamphlets allegedly published by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>.
                        <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s doubts apparently went unremarked by many collectors, for the spurious 
                        pamphlets continued to sell, but the editors&#x02BC; alarms helped prompt 
                        <persName corresp="#HGP">Graham Pollard</persName> and <persName corresp="#JC">John Carter</persName> to launch their investigation into questionable

                    </p>
                    <p>Despite the openings it enabled for forgery, the fashion for collecting modern &#x201C;firsts&#x201D; 
                        brought a number of positive scholarly developments, including an
                        interest in juvenilia and an increased and more systematic attention to
                        the bibliography of <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date> books. The relish for first
                        editions&#x2014;which for laypeople soon became synonymous with book
                        collecting&#x2014;was not a feature of earlier
                        <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date> collecting. Earlier collectors, insofar as they cared
                        about modern authors at all, had typically been drawn to later editions
                        of modern works on the presumed strength of sounder
                        editing or more lavish production. Now, because first&#x2010;edition collectors set a premium on copies that preserved the original condition of publication, 
                        bibliographers realized an opening for the scholarly study of the
                        <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date> book, preparing the way for the New Bibliographers 
                        of the <date notBefore="1901" notAfter="1930">early twentieth century</date> such as <persName corresp="#JC">Carter</persName> and

                        <persName corresp="#MSS">Michael Sadleir</persName>, started with collecting first editions of

                        first&#x2010;edition collecting as &#x201C;a diversion of recent growth&#x201D; pursued
                        by &#x201C;hystericals&#x201D; like himself. &#x201C;For my part to love an
                        author is to collect him&#x201D;, he explained, and the urge could be satisfied
                        only by first editions in their original condition: &#x201C;Of the absurdity of
                        this I am cheerfully aware&#x201D; (pp. 2, 3, 6).<!-- DCH check p nos. --> By

                        modern&#x2010;author collecting formed the impediment to bibliographical method, by

                        explain the downfall of <date notBefore="1837-06-20" notAfter="1901-01-22">Victorian</date> collecting. In their view, the fashion for collecting modern firsts could never achieve scholarly method, owing to 
                        a blinding sentimentality that, combined with competitive greed,
                        led to deserved exploitation by sharpers and forgers: &#x201C;As
                        the distance in time between collectors and the object of their enthusiasm
                        lessened [i.e., as collectors turned to moderns instead of
                        incunabula] their interest
                        took on a more personal colour, and the sentimental element became gradually
                        stronger. Collectors were interested in the lives and habits of their favourite
                        authors; they paid more attention to minor productions; they visualised the
                        arrival of the first copies on the author&#x02BC;s breakfast table&#x2014;a

                        With this story of the rise of outmoded biographical sentiment surrounding modern

                        of forgery, by accounting for the vulnerability of the <date notBefore="1837-06-20" notAfter="1901-01-22">Victorian</date> rare&#x2010;book market to gullibility and greed. 
                        The <title type="book" corresp="#CARTERPOLLARDENQUIRY"><hi rend="italic">Enquiry</hi></title> drew on modern bibliographical

                        as arriving in their original wrappers on the author&#x02BC;s breakfast table. A
                        secondary implication of this narrative was that collectors had developed an
                        inordinate and ridiculous interest in modern authors&#x02BC; juvenilia, a form of publication that was particularly targeted by <persName corresp="#TJW">Wise</persName> and <persName corresp="#HBF">Forman</persName>&#x02BC;s forgeries.

                        collecting, <persName corresp="#JC">Carter</persName> and <persName corresp="#HGP">Pollard</persName> summarize a debate, which arose in the <date notBefore="1890" notAfter="1899">1890</date>s, over the
                        tendency of modern&#x2010;author collecting to favor first editions of minor works:
                        among these, juvenilia are treated as a self&#x2010;evident distraction from the proper
                        aims of collecting. The conservative position was represented by

At this time, according to <persName corresp="#BALLEN">Brian Allen</persName>, <persName corresp="#WR">Roberts</persName> was building a career as an art critic for

                        for the art trade, outside the institutional art history establishment. His authority
                        depended on upholding normative standards for taste and expertise that he himself could wield

                        The &#x201C;craze for first editions&#x201D; was a ready target, 
                        having &#x201C;now reached its extremest form of childishness&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#WR">Roberts</persName> fumed. He framed the
                        trend as an offense against &#x201C;rational form&#x201D; of collecting properly overseen by &#x201C;scholars and
                        men of judgment&#x201D; who focus on &#x201C;books of importance and books with both histories
                        and reputations&#x201D;, as opposed to manias pursued by &#x201C;too&#x2010;zealous persons who feed
                        their own vanity by hanging on to the coat&#x2010;tails of eminent men and claim the
                        title of public benefactors by &#x2018;resurrecting&#x2019; from a well&#x2010;merited obscurity some
                        worthless tract or obsolete and ephemeral magazine article, and trumpeting it

                        In defense of the upstart collecting, <persName corresp="#TJW">Wise</persName> ventured a claim about modern
                        literary history, which happened to shore up the value and plausibility of the pamphlets he was secretly forging:
                        &#x201C;Compositions which now find a fitting path to publicity through the medium of
                        the periodical press were formerly printed separately, and circulated in the
                        shape of a tract or pamphlet. A guide to such ephemera would be of the utmost
                        value to dealer and collector alike&#x201D; (quoted in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CARTERPOLLARDENQUIRY"><persName corresp="#JC">Carter</persName> and <persName corresp="#HGP">Pollard</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#CARTERPOLLARDENQUIRY"><hi rend="italic">Enquiry</hi></title></ref>, 106). <persName corresp="#JC">Carter</persName> and
                        <persName corresp="#HGP">Pollard</persName> looked back on this debate from the perspective of the <title type="book" corresp="#CARTERPOLLARDENQUIRY"><hi rend="italic">Enquiry</hi></title>, in
                        which they were exposing <persName corresp="#TJW">Wise</persName>&#x02BC;s forgeries by means, as they saw it, of replacing dubiously fashionable tastes in
                        collecting with scientific bibliographic method. Irresistibly, they came down on <persName corresp="#WR">Roberts</persName>&#x02BC;s side, declaring that the &#x201C;collecting public&#x201D; of

                        as less a scholarly or polemical history, than a rationale of approaches to
                        collecting based on his experiences throughout a distinguished career of book
                        dealing (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DICKINSONJOHNCARTER">Dickinson, <title type="book" corresp="#DICKINSONJOHNCARTER"><hi rend="italic">John Carter</hi></title></ref>, 176&#x2013;81). The
                        point to be taken about such a work is that, by the <date notBefore="1934" notAfter="1967">mid&#x2010;twentieth
                            century</date>, it had become non&#x2010;controversial to treat the <date notBefore="1837-06-20" notAfter="1901-01-22">Victorian</date> collector, in <persName corresp="#MSS">Sadleir</persName>&#x02BC;s words, with a
                        &#x201C;suspicion&#x201D; that had become
                        &#x201C;deeply engrained in the mind of scholars and librarians&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SADLEIRDEVELOPMENTBIBLIOGRAPHICALSTUDY"><title type="essay" corresp="#SADLEIRDEVELOPMENTBIBLIOGRAPHICALSTUDY">&#x201C;Development of Bibliographical Study&#x201D;</title></ref>, 147). The
                        problem with such suspicions, and with making such vague concepts as
                        &#x201C;sentimentality&#x201D; operative in a historical narrative about collecting in the
                            <date notBefore="1890" notAfter="1899">1890s</date>, is that <persName corresp="#JC">Carter</persName>&#x02BC;s normative &#x201C;taste&#x201D; and &#x201C;technique&#x201D; overwrote the debate
                        in which <date notBefore="1837-06-20" notAfter="1901-01-22">Victorian</date> collectors themselves engaged over the nature and role of 
                        <hi rend="italic">sentiment</hi> for the physical book. In the 
                        <date notBefore="1870" notAfter="1899">1870s through the 1890s</date>, writers on
                        collecting characterized a &#x201C;sentiment for the book&#x201D; as a new phenomenon, and
                        the collecting community debated the nature and value of this sentiment along with
                        the goals it sponsored&#x2014;such as the value of acquiring each and every
                        publication by a popular modern author, including &#x201C;minor&#x201D;
                        productions from juvenilia to last words, in order to form a comprehensive
                        collection of that writer (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HANSONSENTIMENTANDMATERIALITY"><persName corresp="#DCH">Hanson</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HANSONSENTIMENTANDMATERIALITY">&#x201C;Sentiment and Materiality in Late&#x2010;Victorian Book Collecting&#x201D;</title></ref>).
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, a popular writer of the <date notBefore="1890" notAfter="1899">1890s</date> on book collecting and a promoter of
                        collecting &#x201C;early editions&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#JHS">J. H. Slater</persName> 
                        (<date notBefore="1854" notAfter="1921">1854&#x2013;1921</date>), used the term <hi rend="italic">sentiment</hi> as roughly
                        synonymous with <hi rend="italic">bibliophily</hi> to describe an appreciation
                        for the physical book as distinct, on the one hand, from utilitarian uses of
                        books, and, on the other, from fashionable or eccentric forms of collecting that
                        resulted in mutilation of books (i.e., such practices as
                        extra&#x2010;illustration or cutting out title pages or colophons to form a separate 
                        collection). Thus, <persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName> anticipated <persName corresp="#JC">Carter</persName>&#x02BC;s distinction between <hi rend="italic">fashion</hi> 
                        in collecting and proper <hi rend="italic">taste</hi> and <hi rend="italic">technique</hi>, 
                        but he did not automatically consign <hi rend="italic">sentiment</hi> to the effects of fashion. 
                        For <persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName>, sentiment for the book was both historically recent and a phenomenon in need of analysis:
                        &#x201C;Of a truth books have only recently come to be regarded as possessing a
                        sentimental value altogether distinct from considerations of utility&#x201D;
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SLATERROMANCE"><persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#SLATERROMANCE"><hi rend="italic">Romance of Book&#x2010;Collecting</hi></title></ref>, 95).
                    </p>
                    <p>The new sentiment was perceived as forming especially around preservation of modern first editions in their original condition. In
                        <persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1894">1894</date>

                        which <persName corresp="#JC">Carter</persName> and <persName corresp="#HGP">Pollard</persName>
                        regarded as the &#x201C;primer&#x201D; of the first edition movement 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CARTERPOLLARDENQUIRY"><title type="book" corresp="#CARTERPOLLARDENQUIRY"><hi rend="italic">Enquiry</hi></title></ref>, 103), <persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName>
                        speculates why the sentiment for modern authors&#x02BC; early works depended on
                        maintaining the physical copy in its original condition. Such copies, he writes, were likely to have been neglected or destroyed before the
                        author&#x02BC;s fame could bestow special interest on the publications; and
                        thus, when &#x201C;these first&#x2010;fruits, crude though they generally
                        are&#x201D;, come to light along with the rising fame of their author, they gain
                        an appropriate sentimental value, which is compounded by their
                        scarcity: &#x201C;the fact that many people want the few copies that have
                        escaped the wrack of neglect, makes them objects of unusual interest. The
                        inevitable reprint comes at last, but it is not the same; sentiment still hangs
                        around the shabby volume of years ago, with all its errors&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SLATEREARLYEDITIONS"><persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#SLATEREARLYEDITIONS"><hi rend="italic">Early Editions</hi></title></ref>, vii).
                    </p>
                    <p>To account for the formation of this sentiment, 
                        <persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName> points to a number of possible origins. The
                        collecting of modern book illustration, which started earlier in the century,
                        instigated a search for early editions for the sake of sharper,
                        early&#x2010;state impressions of engravings and woodcuts. Another cause of
                        collectors&#x02BC; sentiment for original condition was the interest in tracing textual revisions by favorite modern
                        authors through successive editions&#x2014;a scholarly attraction prompted by a tendency of certain 
                        modern writers, such as <persName corresp="#ALT">Tennyson</persName>, to publish successive, revised versions of their work 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SLATEREARLYEDITIONS"><persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#SLATEREARLYEDITIONS"><hi rend="italic">Early Editions</hi></title></ref>, v&#x2013;vii; 
                        see also <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SLATERROMANCE"><persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#SLATERROMANCE"><hi rend="italic">Romance of Book&#x2010;Collecting</hi></title></ref>, 118&#x2013;19). In connection with the
                        latter interest, <persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName> does reflect a sentimentality in <persName corresp="#JC">Carter</persName> and
                        <persName corresp="#HGP">Pollard</persName>&#x02BC;s sense of the collector&#x02BC;s imaginary closeness to the life
                        of a favorite author. Dramatizing the appeal of the first edition, <persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName> evokes a
                        &#x201C;personal connection&#x201D; with the author: &#x201C;It may be assumed
                        that the author has in the vast majority of cases seen and handled the book for
                        which he was himself responsible; the very copy we hold in our hand may have
                        belonged to him.&#x201D; Despite such over&#x2010;dramatization, <persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName>&#x02BC;s
                        idea of a sentiment driving a nascient textual criticism of modern literature is
                        legitimately scholarly, and not merely nostalgic: first
                        editions, he argues, supply the possibility of tracing &#x201C;the working of the
                        author&#x02BC;s mind by a comparison of the wording of one edition with that of
                        another&#x201D;, and of understanding &#x201C;why [the author] made the
                        alterations&#x201D; and even &#x201C;enter[ing] into [the
                        author&#x02BC;s] thoughts, and perhaps . . . appreciat[ing] his feelings&#x201D; about such revisions

                    </p>
                    <p>During the height of the perceived craze, the <hi rend="italic">sentiment</hi> for early editions was not necessarily controversial in itself. 
                        Whereas <persName corresp="#JC">Carter</persName> and <persName corresp="#HGP">Pollard</persName> later presented the movement in two&#x2010;dimensional terms&#x2014;opponents 
                        and supporters ranged on either side of the issue, as besotted amateurs deranged the rare&#x2010;book market with heedless investments in valueless stock&#x2014;the 
                        sentiment for the materiality of early editions was recognized on both sides as a discovey worth serious attention. 
                        When <persName corresp="#WR">William Roberts</persName> collected his <title type="periodical" corresp="#FORTNIGHTLYREVIEW"><hi rend="italic">Fortnightly</hi></title> essays in book form, 
                        he moderated his attitude: though continuing to berate the &#x201C;cult&#x201D; surrounding firsts, he confessed to sharing an
                        appreciation of the &#x201C;charm [that] is so much a matter of feeling&#x201D; in the
                        &#x201C;attraction of a first edition&#x201D;. While insisting on reserving for professional scrutiny the features of a 
                        first edition that, to a bibliographer, are &#x201C;much more than sentimental&#x201D; (i.e., 
                        analytical bibliographic description of papers, typefaces, and bindings that have fallen
                        out of fashion), <persName corresp="#WR">Roberts</persName> admits that the appeal of an early edition &#x201C;falls into the category of
                        things which are not explainable&#x201D; to &#x201C;the utilitarian&#x201D;. The shabby volume is
                        &#x201C;esteemed as bringing our sons or grandsons nearer than any amount of written
                        description to our own &#x2018;old&#x2019; times&#x201D;. The pleasure is &#x201C;spiritual&#x201D; and the
                        &#x201C;experience . . . a thing of feeling and not of argument&#x201D;

                        comprehensive collecting was expressed on the <placeName corresp="#USA">American</placeName> side, as on the English. 
                        <persName corresp="#FWH">Francis Whiting Halsey</persName>, a journalist prominent in book reviewing for the New York newspapers, wrote in <date when="1902">1902</date> with some alarm over the
                        voluminous increase in publishing over the 
                        <date notBefore="1876" notAfter="1900">final quarter of the nineteenth century</date>,
                        including the &#x201C;large volume of reprints&#x201D; and modern editions.
                        While <persName corresp="#FWH">Halsey</persName> commented favorably on the high demand for modern
                        firsts in <persName corresp="#USA">America</persName> as in <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>,

                        favorite authors, he is dubious about the state of the market for such collecting: 
                        &#x201C;In <placeName corresp="#USA">this country</placeName> it is early, choice, or curious editions of
                        standard modern authors that fetch large sums&#x201D; in spite of &#x201C;sharp
                            <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">English</placeName> competition&#x201D;

                    </p>
                    <p>In the lively competition among collectors to make their modern author
                        collections comprehensive, the controversy arose in part, as <persName corresp="#FWH">Halsey</persName> suggests, from a perceived
                        distortion of pricing in the market for rarities. For <persName corresp="#WR">William Roberts</persName>, excessive value
                        was placed on copies of minor publications as compared with canonical works:
                        &#x201C;Where a collector desires to have a complete series of the works written by the
                        author or authors to whom he devotes his attention&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#WR">Roberts</persName> remarked, a handful of
                        first editions took on a disproportionate value merely because &#x201C;they are
                        exceedingly rare, and . . . that is about as much as can be urged in their
                        favour&#x201D;. In the case of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, for example, the value of first editions of the
                        major works had declined in the market, while &#x201C;the publications of Mr. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>
                        which more than maintain their commercial value are those which are quite
                        unknown except to the specialist. They are little pamphlets and tracts, which
                        were, for the most part, printed in exceedingly small numbers, and are now
                        practically unprocurable. Although there are about a dozen collectors who have
                        spared neither time nor money to render their Ruskiniana complete, we believe
                        that not more than one can claim to have an absolutely final series of the works
                        of the &#x2018;master&#x2019;. A rough calculation places the value of a complete set of
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> at not much short of &#x00A3;300 for about sixty distinct publications&#x201D;

                        Realizing the fears of conservatives like <persName corresp="#WR">Roberts</persName>, who lamented that an appreciation of

                        the consequent tendency he perceived among writers on collecting like 
                        <persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName> to rank the importance of modern first
                        editions by their market value rather than by their solely bibliographical

                        &#x201C;the bibliographical importance of one book by any particular author is
                        as great as the bibliographical importance of any other book by the same writer.
                        Each book marks a stage in the growth or decadence of the writer&#x02BC;s

                    <p>Like the collecting of modern firsts itself, the reprint and bibliography industry that supported the movement irritated detractors.

                        &#x201C;heralded as a wonderful and valuable piece of literature&#x201D; by publicists (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROBERTSFIRSTEDITIONMANIA"><persName corresp="#WR">Roberts</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#ROBERTSFIRSTEDITIONMANIA">&#x201C;The First Edition Mania&#x201D;</title></ref>, 347, 349). 
                        To the editors of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#ATHENAEUM"><hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi></title>, it was a matter of &#x201C;astonishment and regret that publishers can be found for such undertakings&#x201D; as reprints and &#x201C;ana&#x201D; volumes&#x2014;the 
                        kinds of labors for which <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="shepherd_r_h_note.php"><persName corresp="#RHS">Richard Herne Shepherd</persName></ref> was known

                        <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> was perhaps the most prolific compiler of single&#x2010;author bibliographies, and he
                        was inventive and industrious in developing other kinds of publications serving the new
                        collecting interests. He edited reprints of neglected works by modern authors, and compiled 
                        &#x201C;ana&#x201D; volumes, which constructed a biographical narrative using selected earlier
                        versions of texts that authors subsequently revised (e.g., <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SHEPHERDTENNYSONIANA"><persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="SHEPHERDTENNYSONIANA"><hi rend="italic">Tennysoniana</hi></title></ref>). 
                        Such publications made <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> a target by authors who resented seeing their early and ephemeral texts, and
                        earlier versions of their more canonical texts, revived in the form of edited reprints or aids to study like the &#x201C;ana&#x201D; volume. 
                        Hostile authors and their representatives, such as reviewers for the <title type="periodical" corresp="#ATHENAEUM"><hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi></title>, attacked <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> and his ilk 
                        as <hi rend="italic">vampires</hi> and as <hi rend="italic">resurrection men</hi>, meaning <hi rend="italic">body snatchers</hi>. 
                        <persName corresp="#AT">Tennyson</persName> was
                        particularly hostile to the reprint industry, which he regarded as mere piracy, and he led the way in taking legal action against <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> 
                        and other editors and publishers engaged in such activity.
                    </p>
                    <p>At the core of these court cases was a question of authors&#x02BC; control over their <hi rend="italic">oeuvre</hi> and

                        when <persName corresp="#JDC">James Dykes Campbell</persName>

                        &#x201C;without the compiler&#x02BC;s name, place of publication, without even the <persName corresp="#ALT">author</persName>&#x02BC;s name, simply titled

                        revised and suppressed states of poems, but <persName corresp="#ALT">Tennyson</persName> defiantly denied the legitimacy and legality of such an undertaking

                        himself at odds with a prominent author, when the <title type="periodical" corresp="#ATHENAEUM"><hi rend="italic">Atheneaum</hi></title> 
                        took the part of <persName corresp="#RB">Robert Browning</persName> in opposing a reprint that <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> proposed to edit,

                        When <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> placed a notice in the press that this reprint was forthcoming, 
                        <persName corresp="#RB">Browning</persName> asked the <title type="periodical" corresp="#ATHENAEUM"><hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi></title> to denounce the project, arguing that its most substantial text, 
                        <persName corresp="#EBB">Barrett Browning</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1833">1833</date> translation of <persName corresp="#AEG">Aeschylus</persName>&#x02BC;s

                    <p>In <date when="1879-06">June 1879</date>, <persName corresp="#RHS">Richard Herne Shepherd</persName> pressed a libel suit against the <title type="periodical" corresp="#ATHENAEUM"><hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi></title> 
                        for accusing him of dishonesty and vampirism, among other slanders. <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> won his case, securing &#x00A3;150 in damages, 
                        not long after <persName corresp="#JAMW">James McNeill Whistler</persName> achieved a merely Pyrrhic victory of a farthing&#x02BC;s worth of damages 
                        in his <date when="1878-11">November 1878</date> libel trial against <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>. Both libel suits were concerned at a fundamental level 
                        with questions of artistic or literary value and the authority for determining such value and holding public sway over such determinations. The issues never arose between 
                        between <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> or the 
                        <orgName corresp="#BRANTWOODCI">Brantwood Circle</orgName>, because <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> never attempted to reprint works by 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, and so a more straightforward violation of intellectual property never brought forward the grander issues of artistic value

                        but I may at least regret the quantity of trouble&#x201D;. Despite this diffidence, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was 
                        &#x201C;especially glad to have note of the letters to newspapers&#x201D;, which <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> had unearthed

                        Whether or not <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and his circle were aware of <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName>&#x02BC;s reputation for piracy 
                        (the exchange predated <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName>&#x02BC;s successful libel suit),

                        and it appears that, far from objecting to the new collecting trend, or to the publishing industry supporting its enthusiasts, 
                        the <orgName corresp="#BRANTWOODCI">Brantwood circle</orgName> stepped forward to supply such publications on their own.

                        <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName> that presented sample entries focused specifically on juvenilia. 
                        While the sample entries boldly included, along with the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS1850"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1850"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> (<date when="1850">1850</date>)</ref>, 
                        an invented description of an early <persName corresp="#TJW">Wise</persName> forgery,

                        the featuring of juvenilia in such a prospectus would not necessarily have been viewed as eccentric. 
                        After all, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself, in his autobiography, <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> (begun in <date when="1885">1885</date>), 
                        had included not only detailed accounts of his early writing, but even a typographic and engraved facsimile of some of his juvenilia, 
                        as &#x201C;an extremely perfect type of the . . . temper of my mind, at the beginning of days just as much as at their end&#x201d;

                        In expressing thanks to <persName corresp="#TJW">Wise</persName> and <persName corresp="#JPS">Smart</persName> for their prospectus, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was therefore disingenuous in commenting to them, as he similarly said to <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName>, that 
                        they had taken too much &#x201C;trouble over a lot of worthless stuff&#x201D; 
                        (quoted in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENWISERUSKINI"><persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#DEARDEMWISERUSKINI">&#x201C;Wise and Ruskin I&#x201D;</title></ref>, 48). 
                        For the emphasis of the prospectus was in keeping with collectors&#x02BC; sentiment for modern firsts in original condition, and with readers&#x02BC; interest 
                        in the textual origins of modern writing. The prospectus was also in keeping with themes in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s autobiographical writing, 
                        and with the <orgName corresp="#BRANTWOODCI">Brantwood circle</orgName>&#x02BC;s anthologizing of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s juvenilia.

                        distorting the market. Surprisingly high auction prices were by commanded by early <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts 
                        as compared to prices for manuscripts of works written in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s maturity.

                        manuscripts associated with <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s youth sold for prices competitive with those for manuscripts of such canonical works 
                        as <title type="book" corresp="#JRSTONESOFVENICE"><hi rend="italic">The Stones of Venice</hi></title>; and prices given for early manuscripts were often were significantly greater than those given for manuscripts of late works. 
                        It is possibly a sign of the ongoing &#x201C;mania&#x201D; for &#x201C;firsts&#x201D; and &#x201C;early editions&#x201D;, 
                        that these early manuscripts were sold alongside modern <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">(i.e., nineteenth&#x2010;century)</date> first editions: 
                        the <date when="1930">1930</date> sale included presentation copies by modern authors from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s library, 
                        along with a prominent lot of books, drawings, and letters by the children&#x02BC;s author and illustrator, <persName corresp="#CKG">Kate Greenaway</persName> 
                        (the latter underscoring associations with childhood, as well); 
                        and the <date when="1931">1931</date> sale included a &#x201C;small library . . . of modern authors&#x201D; 
                        unrelated to the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection, as well as more modern firsts from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s library, 
                        including correspondence by modern authors to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>. Perhaps the association of these lots indicates that, 
                        as late as <date notBefore="1930" notAfter="1931">1930&#x2013;31</date>, the collecting of modern&#x2010;author firsts helped to buoy 
                        the prices for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s manuscript juvenilia, just as <persName corresp="#JC">Carter</persName> and <persName corresp="#HGP">Pollard</persName> 
                        remarked with dismay the princely sum given as recently as <date when="1931">1931</date> for a juvenile 
                        publication by <persName corresp="#RCB">Rupert Brooke</persName>. If these associations still held held force, <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName>
