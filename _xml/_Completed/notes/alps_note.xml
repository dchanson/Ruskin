                <p>So far as is known, the most direct outcome of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> first encounter with the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>, gained during the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1833_note.php">Tour of <date notBefore="1833-05-14" notAfter="1833-08-19">1833</date></ref>,
                    was drawing rather than writing: see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="drawings_1833_note.php">Drawings from the <date notBefore="1833-05-14" notAfter="1833-08-19">Tour of 1833</date></ref>. His writing about the mountains is often generalized and literary in origin. The trope of first sighting frames the sublime spectacle of the distant <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>, 
                    which are understood as a &#x201C;barrier&#x201D; both between nations on earth and between planes of earthly and spiritual existence. One influential source of these tropes for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>
                    was the poem <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;<geogName corresp="#ALPS">The Alps</geogName>&#x201D;</title> in <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic"><placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName></hi></title> by

                    As explained in connection with another important first&#x2010;sighting poem for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>,

                    <placeName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</placeName> fails to specify which range of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> he first saw illuminated by the setting sun, leading to speculation later by both himself and critics about what would in fact have been visible 
                    from a vantage point above the town of <placeName corresp="#SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</placeName>.</p>
                <p>Respecting certain kinds of sublime experience, the specific chain of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> that travelers first sighted would not have mattered. The Nonconformist clergyman, 
                    <persName corresp="#TRAFFLES">Thomas Raffles</persName> (<date notBefore="1788" notAfter="1863">1788&#x2013;1863</date>), first viewed the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> 
                    from a height near <geogName corresp="#LADOLE">Dole</geogName> in the <geogName corresp="#JURA">Jura</geogName>&#x2014;an approach through <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> to the western <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>,
                    a chain that would have been invisible to the Ruskins approaching the mountains from the north in <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName>. Nonetheless, <persName corresp="#TRAFFLES">Raffles</persName> was moved to pious reflections, 
                    which he expressed using tropes similar to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s:</p>
                <floatingText>
                    <body>
                        <div type="essay">
                            <p>[T]he carriage suddenly stopped, and the postilion cried out, <hi rend="italic">There&#x02BC;s <geogName corresp="#MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</geogName>! 
                                There are the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>!</hi> I started from a deep reverie into which I had fallen, and lifting up my eyes, beheld the whole chain of 
                                <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>, forming the line of the horizon, at the immense distance of one hundred and thirty miles, and yet distinctly seen 
                                with the naked eye. <geogName corresp="#MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</geogName> appeared towering above them all, and glittering in the sunbeams like a crystal lake. 
                                The emotions of my mind at that moment were unutterable. I had not power to speak&#x2014;my heart beat with increased rapidity within my bosom&#x2014;and 
                                now that the sublime and stupendous objects, upon which my imagination had dwelt so long and with so much ardour,were actually before me, I could scarcely realize the scene, 
                                or believe the vision true. And, indeed, there was something so unearthly in their appearance&#x2014;distance, and the splendours of a summer noon had so melted and 
                                softened them down&#x2014;that they looked like a singular combination of dark and brilliant clouds resting on the earth; while the suddenness and unexpectedness of their appearance, 
                                all contributed to heighten the effect, and give it more the air of enchantment than reality. You may smile, perhaps, that I should make so much of what 
                                some would deem a very little thing, and occupy so many lines in telling you where and when I first saw the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>. But if there are any scenes 
                                that interest me, next to the important discoveries of the sacred volume, they are the sublime and beautiful in nature&#x2014;such objects as surround me now, 
                                and such as are to feast my eyes and fill my heart, if life and health are spared, through the ensuing week. The man who does not kindle at these displays of the 
                                <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#CREATOR">Creator</persName>&#x02BC;s power&#x2014;that has no spirit stirring in his breast to harmonize and mingle with them, 
                                had better stay in cities, and study man! But I am happy sometimes to escape from <hi rend="italic">man</hi>, to study <hi rend="italic">nature</hi>&#x2014;and amidst her awful 
                                or her lovely scenes, to converse with <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#CREATOR">God</persName>. I send you a sketch of the scenery to which I have now alluded. It was committed immediately to paper, while the outline was before me. 
                                It has the merit of correctness, therefore, though I am well aware it is destitute of every other.</p></div></body></floatingText>

                <p>In such an approach to &#x201C;the amazing barrier&#x201D;, specific geographical references are nearly consumed in the spiritual fire of Dantean and Miltonic language for <placeName type="scriptural" corresp="#HEAVEN">Paradise</placeName>;
                    and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> innovation on <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers&#x02BC;s</persName> <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic"><placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName></hi></title> is to substitute this spiritualized idea of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> 
                    for the borne of <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> that draws the speaker toward the ultimate goal of the journey. Although <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> left the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account</title> unfinished, he clearly meant to locate 
                    that ultimate destination in the <geogName corresp="#CHAMONIX">Chamonix</geogName> valley overlooked by <geogName corresp="#MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</geogName>, as proven by the spiritual experiences described in the essays

                <p>This is not to say that, on this first major Continental tour, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> failed to learn the names in various languages of famous peaks such as <geogName corresp="#MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</geogName>, <geogName corresp="#MONTRIGI">Mont Rigi</geogName>, and <geogName corresp="#MONTEROSA">Monte Rosa</geogName>&#x2014;or
                    for that matter, of heights in the <geogName corresp="#SIEBENGENBIRGE">Siebengebirge</geogName> along the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>, or in what portions of the <geogName corresp="#APENNINES">Apennines</geogName> the family crossed. In the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account</title>, he started to employ the names of the Alpine ranges, 
                    as well, but mainly in order to gesture at the vast scope of the entire chain. In <title type="book" corresp="#EBELTRAVELLERSGUIDE"><hi rend="italic">The Traveller&#x02BC;s Guide through <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName></hi></title>
