                <head type="title">Cooke Family</head>
                <p>Family of English engravers and artists. Of German ancestry, the brothers <persName corresp="#WBCOOKE">William Bernard</persName> (<date notBefore="1779" notAfter="1855">1779&#x2013;1855</date>) and <persName corresp="#GCOOKE">George</persName> (<date notBefore="1781" notAfter="1834">1781&#x2013;1834</date>), 
                    were apprenticed to engravers in the late eighteenth century, when English engraving was undergoing stylistic and technical development 
                    along with British landscape painting and illustration. <persName corresp="#WBCOOKE">William Bernard</persName> was also an entrepreneur, 
                    who operated a print shop and gallery in <placeName type="building" corresp="#SOHOSQUARE">Soho Square</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> (ca. <date notBefore="1821" notAfter="1830">1821&#x2013;30</date>). The gallery exhibited English engraving and watercolor, 
                    using items not only from the Cooke shop but also on loan from collectors. <persName corresp="#GCOOKE">George</persName>, also drawing on the assistance of the brothers&#x02BC; studio, 
                    was extensively occupied by an aquatint project in botanical illustration, <title type="artwork" corresp="#COOKEBOTANICAL"><hi rend="italic">The Botanical Cabinet</hi></title> (<date notBefore="1817" notAfter="1833">1817&#x2013;33</date>). 
                    A son of <persName corresp="#GCOOKE">George</persName> became the marine painter, <persName corresp="#EWC">Edward William Cooke</persName> (<date notBefore="1811" notAfter="1880">1811&#x2013;80</date>); and 
                    a cousin of <persName corresp="#EWC">Edward</persName>, <persName corresp="#WJC">William John Cooke</persName>, became an engraver in steel, who contributed advancements in etching that medium 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MUNDAYCOOKE"><persName corresp="#JMUNDAY">Munday</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#MUNDAYCOOKE"><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#EWC">Edward William Cooke</persName></hi></title></ref>, 27, 32&#x2013;33, 37&#x2013;38).</p>
                <p>The elder brothers oversaw an ambitious number of projects in their shop (<ref type="bibliography" target="biblography.php#MUNDAYCOOKE"><persName corresp="#JMUNDAY">Munday</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#MUNDAYCOOKE"><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#EWC">Edward William Cooke</persName></hi></title></ref>, 34, 39&#x2013;42), 
                    but their most important joint project was <title type="artwork" corresp="COOKESOUTHERNCOAST"><hi rend="italic">Picturesque Views of the Southern Coast of England</hi></title> (<date notBefore="1814" notAfter="1826">1814&#x2013;26</date>), 
                    based chiefly on drawings by <persName corresp="#JMWT">J. M. W. Turner</persName>. Although the project was beset by delays, 
                    in the course of it <persName corresp="JMWT">Turner</persName> learned to treat engraving as an expressive medium in which he could play a collaborative role. 
                    <persName corresp="#WBCOOKE">W. B. Cooke</persName> was also instrumental in furthering <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s contributions to steel engraving, by employing the mezzotint engraver, 
                    <persName corresp="#TGL">Thomas Goff Lupton</persName> (<date notBefore="1792" notAfter="1873">1791&#x2013;1873</date>), with whom <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName> had already collaborated, and who was making successful breakthroughs 
                    in the practical use of that stubborn but durable medium. For these first <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName> engravings on steel, <persName corresp="#WBCOOKE">Cooke</persName> commissioned the series, 
                    <!-- ADDED COOKE TO TITLE --><title type="artwork" corresp="#COOKERIVERSOFENGLAND"><hi rend="italic">The Rivers of England</hi></title> (<date notBefore="1823" notAfter="1827">1823&#x2013;27</date>). This series was the occasion of the first serious falling&#x2010;out between <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName> 
                    and the Cooke brothers, over the question of whether <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName> would &#x201C;touch&#x201D; (make improvements to) plates based on drawings by another artist, 
                    <persName corresp="#TGIRTIN">Thomas Girtin</persName> (<date notBefore="1775" notAfter="1802">1775&#x2013;1802</date>) (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SHANESTURNERSRIVERS"><persName corresp="#ESHANES">Shanes</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#SHANESTURNERSRIVERS"><hi rend="italic">Turner&#x02BC;s Rivers, Harbours and Coasts</hi></title></ref>, 5&#x2013;12).</p>
