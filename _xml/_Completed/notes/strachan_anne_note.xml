                    the elder Ruskins&#x2014;who were <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s parents and <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02bc;s aunt and uncle&#x2014;were living in <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>,

                <p>It was <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> who was sent to rescue <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> when he fell ill on the way to <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>

                    she would have been stretched between her regular housekeeping duties and nursing <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>, so it makes sense 
                    that a girl would have been hired to help in the house. The fifteen&#x2010;year&#x2010;old <persName corresp="#ASB">Anne</persName> presumably was inexperienced, 
                    not yet the servant who, according to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s testimonial, &#x201c;was never quite in her glory unless some of us were ill&#x201d;

But a mere girl&#x02bc;s service may have been as much as the Ruskins could afford in their straitened circumstances. 
                    To reduce expenses, <persName corresp="#CR">Catherine</persName> had pressed her husband to move from <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName> to the country,

                    following their marriage, when living at their <placeName type="building" corresp="#HUNTERST">Hunter Street</placeName> house in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>. <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> was at this time a newborn

But if <persName corresp="#ASB">Anne</persName> had been present in the background over the past five years, 
                    she was to some extent privy to the most dramatic events of her employers&#x02bc; lives. <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> and <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> had been betrothed since <date when="1809">1809</date>, 
                    and the crisis of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s near&#x2010;lethal illness appears to have deepened their commitment, but now their union faced opposition by <persName corresp="#JTR">John Thomas</persName>. 
                    <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> was convinced that the tension would bring about <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02bc;s death (see <title type="letter" corresp="#mcc_to_jjr_1814-07-12">Margaret Cock to John James Ruskin, 12 July 1814</title>;

                    Unexpectedly, in <date when="1815-06">June 1815</date>, <persName corresp="#JTR">John Thomas</persName> descended into madness. His son&#x02bc;s emotions were divided between apprehension for his parents and relief for himself and <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>. 
                    Writing to his mother, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> rejected recourse to a &#x201c;public asylum&#x201d; where his father would be subjected to &#x201c;Surrounding Horrors&#x201d;, 
                    while recognizing that even &#x201c;the strictest confinement&#x201d; at home risked the &#x201c;safety&#x201d; and &#x201c;health of the rest of the family&#x201d;. Writing to <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>, 
                    he expressed compassion for his father&#x02bc;s &#x201c;frailties&#x201d; but he could not resist interpreting his father&#x02bc;s madness to their advantage 
                    as having rendered his father &#x201c;in a manner dead to all of us&#x201d;, exonerating the family from &#x201c;a place in his affections&#x201d;, and putting their 
                    &#x201c;actions&#x201d; beyond a hold even on <persName corresp="#JTR">John Thomas</persName>&#x02bc;s &#x201c;least interest&#x201d; much less his control. <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> also fretted over how public exposure &#x201c;may injure me in business&#x201d; 
                    (<title type="letter" corresp="#jjr_to_cr_1815-06-30">John James to Catherine Ruskin, 30 June 1815</title>; and

                    As it turned out, release came by way of further calamity: in <date when="1817-10">October 1817</date>, <persName corresp="#CR">Catherine Ruskin</persName> died suddenly, 
                    followed shortly by <persName corresp="#JTR">John Thomas</persName>&#x02bc;s bloody suicide. At the time, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> was already in mourning for her own mother, 
                    <persName corresp="#MCC">Margaret Cock</persName> of <placeName corresp="#CROYDON">Croydon</placeName>. Throughout all this, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> was struggling to launch a new wine importing business in partnership with 
                    <persName corresp="#PD">Pedro Domecq</persName> and <persName corresp="#HT">Henry Telford</persName>, for his fateful journey north in <date when="1813">1813</date> had been prompted by his flight from the declining fortunes 
                    of his previous employer, <orgName corresp="#GORDONMURPHYCO">Gordon, Murphy, &#x0026; Company</orgName> (see the correspondence, <date notBefore="1812" notAfter="1817">1812&#x2013;17</date>, in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 53&#x2013;88;

                <p>As a young servant at <placeName type="building" corresp="#BOWERSWELL">Bowerswell</placeName>, <persName corresp="#ASB">Anne</persName> shared the women&#x02bc;s vantage on these events, which helps to explain a degree of intimacy 
                    between her and <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>. One can only speculate, however, about the causes that underlay a prickliness in their relationship, 
                    which is treated as comedy in reminiscences by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and by <persName corresp="#GBURNEJONES">Georgiana Burne&#x2010;Jones</persName>, but with a strong suggestion 
                    that <persName corresp="#ASB">Anne</persName> was fiercely loyal to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> and <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> to the detriment of civility to <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> and &#x201c;a want of deference&#x201d; toward her mistress that,
                    as <persName corresp="#GBURNEJONES">Burne&#x2010;Jones</persName> put it, &#x201c;was certainly not the growth of the moment&#x201d; 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 35:31; <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BURNEJONESMEMORIALS"><persName corresp="#GBURNEJONES">G.

                    about how <persName corresp="#ASB">Anne</persName> chose to manage her power by virtue of her presence at events that <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> and <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> presumably did not want divulged to <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x2014;at
