                <p><persName corresp="#WT">Willard Thorp</persName>, professor of English at <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton University</orgName>, played an important role in the study of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s early manuscripts,

                    at <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Princeton University Library</orgName>. Thus, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collecting at <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName> mirrored that at <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale University Library</orgName>,

                    and <persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName> helped coalesce the biographically comprehensive approach to the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> archive that

                <p>In collecting of Victorian printed works, <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName> and <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> reflected a trend associated with 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.php">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</ref>. 
                    Private collectors sought to compile a comprehensive run of an author&#x02bc;s first editions in their original condition, 
                    from juvenilia to last words&#x2014;a goal that for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <persName corresp="#RB">Browning</persName> and <persName corresp="#EBB">Barrett&#x2010;Browning</persName>, <persName corresp="#ALT">Tennyson</persName>, and other major British nineteenth&#x2010;century writers could entail hundreds of items. 
                    American institutions benefited by donations of such collections, <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> receiving a nearly complete <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> bequest from

                    on the path to assembling an impressive literary archive of nineteenth&#x2010;century British writers (and later, nineteenth&#x2010; and twentieth&#x2010;century American writers) by persuading many collectors 
                    to contribute to the library&#x02bc;s rare&#x2010;book holdings.</p>
                
                <p>First&#x2010;edition hunters extended their print collections with manuscripts, <hi rend="italic">alia</hi>, and&#x2014;in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s case, drawings&#x2014;as such items came available; 
                    and an extrordinary opportunity for access to such materials opened for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collectors on both sides of the Atlantic with the

                    These auctions made available the full chronological scope and diversity of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s manuscripts and drawings. 
                    Fortunately for American institutions, the <placeName corresp="#BOSTON">Boston</placeName> rare&#x2010;book and literary manuscript dealer,

                    who was himself a <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collector, took advantage of the auctions with boldness and intelligence. 
                    Through <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> was the beneficiary primarily of the <date when="1930">1930</date> sale, their acquisitions directed by

                    <p><persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName> ultimately built his scholarly reputation as an Americanist, but when these developments in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collecting were unfolding in the <date notBefore="1920" notAfter="1939">1920s and 1930s</date> 
                        <persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName> was teaching British Victorian and modern poetry. With degrees in English from <orgName corresp="#HAMILTON">Hamilton College</orgName> (B.A.) and <orgName corresp="#HARVARD">Harvard University</orgName> (M.A.), 
                        <persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName> first taught at <orgName corresp="#SMITHCOLLEGE">Smith College</orgName> in <date notBefore="1921" notAfter="1924">1921&#x2013;24</date>, and then came to <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName> in <date when="1925">1925</date> for a Ph.D. in English. 
                        He completed the degree in <date when="1926">1926</date> and joined the teaching staff of <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName>&#x02bc;s English Department. Although his dissertation concerned realism in Elizabethan drama, 
                        he earned popularity as a teacher with a course on Victorian poetry. An early publication in this area&#x2014;following 
                        his first major article, in <title type="periodical" corresp="#PMLA"><hi rend="italic">PMLA</hi></title> for <date when="1928">1928</date>, on stage adaptations of English Gothic fiction, which secured his assistant professorship&#x2014;was a <date when="1932">1932</date> anthology of Victorian poets, 
                        <title type="book" corresp="#THORPPARROTTPOETRYOFTHETRANSITION"><hi rend="italic">Poetry of the Transition, <date notBefore="1850" notAfter="1914">1850&#x2013;1914</date></hi></title>, 
                        which he edited along with his dissertation director, <persName corresp="#TMP">Thomas Marc Parrott</persName>, a scholar of <persName corresp="#RB">Robert Browning</persName> as well as <persName corresp="#WSP">Shakespeare</persName>. 
                        By <date when="1939">1939</date>, when he achieved the rank of associate professor, <persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName> had begun turning his research and teaching to American literature, 
                        undertaking in <date when="1940">1940</date> to teach <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName>&#x02bc;s first graduate seminar in American studies (on the Transcendentalists), and in <date when="1941">1941</date> he organized 
                        the interdisciplinary American Civilization Program, the first interdepartmental program at <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROBERTSONTHORP"><persName corresp="#DARJR">Robertson</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#ROBERTSONTHORP">&#x201c;Remembering Professor Thorp&#x201d;</title></ref>, 128&#x2013;29, 130&#x2013;32). 
                        The year <date when="1939">1939</date>, when <persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName> organized donors for the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> purchase, might therefore be regarded as the culmination of his Victorian scholarship, before he turned to other interests.</p>
                    
                    <p>The anthology <title type="book" corresp="#THORPPARROTTPOETRYOFTHETRANSITION"><hi rend="italic">Poetry of the Transition</hi></title> 
                        reflects a breadth of acquaintance with both major and lesser&#x2010;known poets of the period. 
                        While <persName corresp="#DARJR">David A. Robertson</persName> recalls <persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName>&#x02bc;s classes in terms anticipating the practical criticism of I. A. Richards&#x2014;<persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName> 
                        would hand out mimeographed poems missing the poet&#x02bc;s name and require students to write responses in direct engagement with the work, not the poet or period 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROBERTSONTHORP"><title type="essay" corresp="#ROBERTSONTHORP">&#x201c;Remembering Professor Thorp&#x201d;</title></ref>, 129)&#x2014;<persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName> did expect his students to survey writers and periods expansively. 
                        According to the introduction of <title type="book" corresp="#THORPPARROTTPOETRYOFTHETRANSITION"><hi rend="italic">Poetry of the Transition</hi></title>, 
                        the editors excluded writers &#x201c;from whose work it was . . . impossible to gather a sufficient number 
                        of poems to furnish material for at least one conference or recitation&#x201d; since &#x201c;long experience in teaching has shown that little is to be gained 
                        by a class discussion of isolated specimens&#x201d;. And though the introduction declares from the outset that &#x201c;there is no such thing as <hi rend="italic">poetry</hi>&#x201d;, 
                        &#x201c;there are only poems&#x201d;, the anthology represents each of its poets in a well&#x2010;rounded arc of development in order to tell its story 
                        &#x201c;of the years of transition from Victorian reticence and respectability to the chaos of the War&#x201d;. The editors believe in a <hi rend="italic">zeitgeist</hi>: 
                        the &#x201c;predominant trait&#x201d; of the period, they say, was &#x201c;individualism&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#THORPPARROTTPOETRYOFTHETRANSITION"><title type="book" corresp="#THORPPARROTTPOETRYOFTHETRANSITION"><hi rend="italic">Poetry of the Transition</hi></title></ref>, ix&#x2013;x, xxi&#x2013;xxii). 
                        These convictions as a teacher guided <persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName> as a collector in his drive to establish <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Princeton University Library</orgName>&#x02bc;s collection of Victorian poets with 
                        no concessions to abridgement that would curtail students&#x02bc; research. The ambition was in sync with the phenomenon of biographically oriented first&#x2010;edition collecting, 
                        which had begun in the period covered in <persName corresp="#TMP">Parrott</persName> and <persName corresp="WT">Thorp</persName>&#x02bc;s anthology.</p>
                    
                    <p>Over the years, <persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName> became a noted collector and donor to <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Princeton University Library</orgName> himself, 
                        and he lent his influence to attracting major collections to the library that did not necessarily pertain to his personal scholarship and teaching, 
                        such as the <persName corresp="#MLP">Morris L. Parrish</persName> collection of Victorian novels, 
                        and the <persName corresp="#FSF">F. Scott Fitzgerald</persName> collection

                        was appointed keeper of rare books at the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling Library</placeName> on the strength of his advocacy, like <persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName>&#x02bc;s, not only of building special collections but also of involving students in the use of archives. 
                        (At the time, <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName> also happened to be working on poetry, publishing <title type="book" corresp="#TINKERGOODESTATE"><hi rend="italic">The Good Estate of Poetry</hi></title> in <date when="1929">1929</date>.) 
                        <persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName>, who in <date when="1930">1930</date> was a young assistant professor, was asked by his dean to work with the newly formed

                        (and probably also his mentor, <persName corresp="#TMP">Parrott</persName>), 
                        consisting of &#x201c;first editions&#x201d; of <persName corresp="#RB">Robert Browning</persName>. The list reflected the prevailing standard for collecting a run of &#x201c;firsts&#x201d; from early works to late, 
                        ranging from the youthful <title type="poem" corresp="#BROWNINGPAULINE"><hi rend="italic">Pauline</hi></title> of <date when="1833">1833</date> to a late publication of <date when="1884">1884</date>

                        For the second issue of the newsletter, <persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName> followed up with a <title type="essay" corresp="#DESIDERATAFPUL2">&#x201c;Desiderata&#x201d;</title> calling for 1,200 titles by 400 Victorian poets. 
                        The estimated cost of the whole, minus the <persName corresp="#RB">Browning</persName> firsts, was calculated at &#x0024;3,500

                    <p><persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName>&#x02bc;s two &#x201c;Desiderata&#x201d; represented the enigma confronting the library and its supporters. Before showy items for the <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Special Collections</orgName> could be contemplated, 
                        the library needed to assemble a basic research&#x2010;grade collection 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_american_research_libraries_note.php#PRINCETON">Ruskin Collecting by American Research Libraries in the Twentieth Century: Ruskin and the Building of Special Collections at Princeton University</ref>). 
                        In the third issue of <title type="periodical" corresp="#BIBLIAFPUL"><hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi></title>, the chair of English, 
                        <persName corresp="#DQB">Dickson Q. Brown</persName>, 
                        justified his faculty&#x02bc;s call for &#x201c;first editions of books of the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries&#x201d;, 
                        especially &#x201c;copies of obscurer writings . . . which can be had only in contemporary editions&#x201d; from their respective periods, 
                        and &#x201c;which are of the utmost significance because of the light . . . they throw on the tastes and interests of a bygone generation 
                        from which some great masterpiece has emerged&#x201d;. As it stood, even undergraduate English majors, when researching senior theses with a &#x201c;zest&#x201d; 
                        to discover &#x201c;something which no one has known before&#x201d;, had to board a train for the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> and <orgName corresp="#COLUMBIAUNIV">Columbia</orgName> university libraries 
                        to find basic materials for their projects (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BROWNLIBRARYNEEDSFPUL"><title type="essay" corresp="#BROWNLIBRARYNEEDSFPUL">&#x201c;Committee on Library Needs&#x201d;</title> [<date when="1931-03">March 1931</date>]</ref>, 2, 4). 
                        To make the needs plain, this issue of <title type="periodical" corresp="#BIBLIAFPUL"><hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi></title> concluded with a sixteen&#x2010;page supplement identifying a &#x201c;want&#x2010;list&#x201d; 
                        of hundreds of literary titles presently unavailable in the home university library. Given these basic disciplinary needs, which were multiplied over many departments, 
                        <persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName> later remembered that, &#x201c;even by <date when="1930">1930</date>, there was seldom anything left over&#x201d; in the library budget 
                        &#x201c;for a rare book or an important unpublished manuscript&#x201d; to grace <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Special Collections</orgName> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#THORPFIRST25YEARS"><persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#THORPFIRST25YEARS">&#x201c;The First Twenty&#x2010;five Years&#x201d;</title></ref>, 98).</p>
                    
                    <p>In <date when="1939">1939</date>, therefore, in order to purchase the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts from <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, 
                        <persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName> had to raise the funds by organizing donors. With so many academic departments having submitted desiderata to <title type="periodical" corresp="#BIBLIAFPUL"><hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi></title> throughout the decade&#x2014;including 
                        the Department of Art and Archaeology, which was closely allied with the recently formed School of Architecture&#x2014;perhaps 
                        the campaign for the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> acquisition was boosted by the writer&#x02BC;s interdisciplinary appeal. Ultimately, a portion of the purchase comprising six of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s sketchbooks and notebooks 
                        was housed in McCormick Hall, the campus art museum and home of Art, Archaeology, and Architecture, rather than in the <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Library Special Collections</orgName> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#THORPRUSKINMANUSCRIPTS"><persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#THORPRUSKINMANUSCRIPTS">&#x201c;The Ruskin Manuscripts&#x201d;</title></ref>, 2). Nonetheless, English faculty predominated among the donors to the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> purchase, 
                        and the campaign was headed by <persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName> along with another professor in the English Department. 
                        Although interdisciplinary and interdepartmental by nature of its materials, the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> purchase can be viewed as culminating the decade of collecting in Victorian literature 
                        that began with <persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName>&#x02bc;s bold call for a comprehensive collection of first editions by four hundred poets  
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1931_note.php#PRINCETON"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1931">1931</date>: <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> and <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Princeton University Library</orgName></ref>).</p>

                        In <date when="1933">1933</date>, the <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">library</orgName> gained a comprehensive collection of <persName corresp="#ALT">Tennyson</persName> &#x201c;firsts&#x201d;, along with an <persName corresp="#RLS">R. L. Stevenson</persName> collection 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GEROULDVANDYKE"><persName corresp="#JTG">Gerould</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#GEROULDVANDYKE">&#x201c;The Henry Van Dyke Bequest&#x201d;</title></ref>). From <date notBefore="1933" notAfter="1938">1933 through 1938</date>, a loyal donor, 
                        <persName corresp="#FHP">Francis H. Payne</persName>, was thanked for supplying funds to purchase Victorian poetry as well as for donating items from his own collection, 
                        including first or early editions by the <orgName corresp="#PRB">Pre&#x2010;Raphaelites</orgName>, <persName corresp="#CKDP">Coventry Patmore</persName>, <persName corresp="#FT">Francis Thompson</persName>, and others. 
                        In <date when="1937">1937</date>, <persName corresp="#FHP">Payne</persName> was tapped again for funds, this time to acquire English novels, <date notBefore="1750" notAfter="1830">1750&#x2013;1830</date>, in support of &#x201c;the establishment in the curriculum 
                        of a graduate course in prose fiction&#x201d; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#VICTORIANPOETSBIBLIA"><title type="essay" corresp="#VICTORIANPOETSBIBLIA">&#x201c;Victorian Poets&#x201d;</title></ref>;

Also in <date when="1937">1937</date>, 
                        an Arthurian&#x2010;themed collection brought first editions to the <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">library</orgName> that were concentrated mainly in Victorian poetry 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ARTHURIANLEGENDBIBLIA"><title type="essay" corresp="#ARTHURIANLEGENDBIBLIA">&#x201c;The Arthurian Legend&#x201d;</title></ref>). Over time, even <persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName>&#x02bc;s initial call for <persName corresp="#RB">Browning</persName> &#x201c;firsts&#x201d; was eventually realized, 
                        with the <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">library</orgName> acquiring eight of the eleven items in the original wish&#x2010;list 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#THORPFIRST25YEARS"><persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#THORPFIRST25YEARS">&#x201c;The First Twenty&#x2010;five Years&#x201d;</title></ref>, 103). Meanwhile, <persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName> was also on the lookout for Victorian fiction: 
                        a <date when="1933">1933</date> account in <title type="periodical" corresp="#BIBLIAFPUL"><hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi></title>&#x2014;unsigned, but written in <persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName>&#x02bc;s florid and convivial style&#x2014;about the opening of an exhibition 
                        of <persName corresp="#MLP">Morris Parrish</persName>&#x02bc;s <persName corresp="#FMT">Trollope</persName> collection reads like an overture to the bequest of his entire Victorian fiction collection, 
                        which would finally be delivered in <date when="1944">1944</date>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Judging by the pages of <title type="periodical" corresp="#BIBLIAFPUL"><hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi></title>, <persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName>&#x02bc;s success in attracting donors may have aroused jealousy, even in his own department. 
                        In <date when="1936">1936</date>, on the occasion of the <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Princeton Library</orgName> having acquired in <date when="1935">1935</date> some significant items in <persName corresp="#JMILTON">Milton</persName> studies, 
                        the Miltonist <persName corresp="#MWK">Maurice W. Kelley</persName> loftily declared that the <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">library</orgName> &#x201c;has yet to be given a single collection of any great English writer&#x201d;&#x2014;the 
                        acquisitions in Victorian studies over the previous five years apparently not qualifying for that distinction. 
                        <persName corresp="#MWK">Kelley</persName> pointedly remarked that &#x201c;the works of <persName corresp="#JMILTON">John Milton</persName> . . . , which are of deep and vital interest to every heir 
                        of the great tradition of English speaking people, yet await the name of a donor&#x201d;, and he suggested that acquisitions 
                        for &#x201c;other collections already started&#x201d; should cease (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#KELLEYMILTONCOLLECTION"><persName corresp="#MWK">Kelley</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#KELLEYMILTONCOLLECTION">&#x201c;John Milton Collection&#x201d;</title></ref>, 4). 
                        Undeterred, <persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName> noted in the next issue of <title type="periodical" corresp="#BIBLIAFPUL"><hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi></title> following <persName corresp="#MWK">Kelley</persName>&#x02bc;s broadside 
                        that some resources dedicated to American studies had dried up, and he insisted that &#x201c;the <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">library</orgName> must continue buying American literature&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#THORPTWOSPECIALCOLLECTIONS"><persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#THORPTWOSPECIALCOLLECTIONS">&#x201c;Two Special Collections&#x201d;</title></ref>, 7). 
                        Presumably, he believed that the great tradition of English&#x2010;speaking people would be advanced, rather than deflected by an innovative program in American studies.</p>
