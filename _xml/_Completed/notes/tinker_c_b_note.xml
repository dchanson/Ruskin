                <p><persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName> was an influential teacher of eighteenth&#x2010; and nineteenth&#x2010;century English literature at <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale University</orgName> from <date notBefore="1903" notAfter="1945">1903 to 1945</date>; 
                    he was also keeper of rare books for <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale University Library</orgName> starting in <date when="1930">1930</date> or <date when="1931">1931</date>, remaining in that post 
                    for a number of years beyond his retirement from teaching. A collector himself, <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName> was known for his generosity 
                    in opening his personal library of manuscripts and rare books for students&#x02bc; use&#x2014;a generous trait he held in common 
                    with his friend and fellow collector, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="adam_r_b_note.php"><persName corresp="#RBA">R. B. Adam II</persName> (<date notBefore="1863" notAfter="1940">1863&#x2013;1940</date>)</ref>

                <p><persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName>, who had always been a zealous advocate for building the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> library&#x02bc;s collections, was just beginning his formal duties 
                    as keeper of rare books, when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collectors and scholars on both sides of the <geogName corresp="#ATLANTIC">Atlantic</geogName> were surprised by the announcement of the 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1930">1930</date></ref> and, a year later, the 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1931_note.php"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1931">1931</date></ref>. 
                    At <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>, since the two <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> sales coincided exactly with the completion the new <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling Memorial Library building</placeName> (<date notBefore="1927" notAfter="1931">1927&#x2013;31</date>), 
                    proposals for new rare book and manuscript acquisitions must have encountered stiff competition merely for the attention of library administrators, 
                    much less for available funding. The first <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> auction was held on <date when="1930-07-24">24 July 1930</date>, when the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> staff had begun 
                    moving books to the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling</placeName> stacks, a process initiated on <date when="1930-07-07">7 July 1930</date>. 
                    <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName> later wrote that he took up his post as keeper &#x201c;some four or five months before the opening of the new <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling library</placeName>&#x201d;, 
                    but left unclear whether he referred to the months prior to the transfer of operations in the summer of <date when="1930">1930</date> 
                    or to the formal dedication of the building, which was held on <date when="1931-04-11">11 April 1931</date>&#x2014;or perhaps he meant the opening of the Rare Books Room, 
                    which was ready on <date when="1931-02-22">22 February 1931</date> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#KEOGHREPORT_1930-31">&#x201c;Report of the Librarian, July 1, 1930&#x2013;June 30, 1931&#x201d;</ref>, 3; 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#TINKERREFLECTIONS"><persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="TINKERREFLECTIONS">&#x201C;Reflections of a Curator&#x201D;</title></ref>, 8). 
                    Whenever he assumed duties, the transition in responsibility may explain some of the obscurity surrounding how <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> 
                    acquired certain items in the sale (see 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php#BUYERS"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1930">1930</date>: The Buyers</ref>).</p>
                <p>Documentation remains to be uncovered to reconstruct fully by what agency <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>&#x02bc;s acquisitions from the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s sales 
                    made their way to the library. Two important lots from the <date when="1930">1930 sale</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s juvenilia and his letters to his father, were bought 
                    probably by <persName corresp="#ALLENH">Hugh Allen</persName>, who was a son of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s publisher, <persName corresp="#GA">George Allen</persName>, and who may have acted as an agent directly for <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>. 
                    Other lots from the <date when="1930">1930 sale</date> were bought by an agent on the behalf of the <placeName corresp="#BOSTON">Boston</placeName> rare book dealer and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collector, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="goodspeed_charles_note.php"><persName corresp="#CG">Charles E. Goodspeed</persName> (<date notBefore="1867" notAfter="1950">1867&#x2013;1950</date>)</ref>, 
                    who sold the lots to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> in <date when="1930-11">November 1930</date> 
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php#BUYERS"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1930">1930</date>: The Buyers</ref>). 
                    Whatever the exact arrangements were, it seems unlikely that these important <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> investments would have been undertaken 
                    without his urging and involvement of <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName>.</p>

                <head type="section">Tinker and Ruskin Studies</head>
                
                <p>While <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName>&#x02bc;s scholarship was centered in <persName corresp="#JBOSWELL">Boswell</persName> and <persName corresp="#SJ">Johnson</persName> studies&#x2014;at least initially, until difficulties with access to manuscripts 
                    derailed his aspirations to continue editing <persName corresp="#JBOSWELL">Boswell</persName>&#x02bc;s papers&#x2014;<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and the <orgName corresp="#PRB">Pre&#x2010;Raphaelites</orgName> held an important place 
                    in his teaching, collecting, and writing. In <date when="1908">1908</date>, <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName> published 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRSELECTIONSTINKER"><title type="anthology" corresp="#JRSELECTIONSTINKER"><hi rend="italic">Selections from the Works of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, 
                    an anthology that he distanced from &#x201c;such a volume as used to be entitled Elegant Extracts&#x201d;, instead reprinting chapters and lectures 
                    from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s works in as complete a form as practicable in order &#x201c;to insure a correct notion of the general complexion&#x201d; of the critic&#x02bc;s ideas. 
                    For <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s thought and literary style constituted a unity, which must be studied as &#x201c;one continuous development&#x201d; (pp. iii, xii, xix). 
                    Such a position would have favored the acquisition of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s juvenilia and letters to his father, along with later manuscripts sampling the wide range 
                    of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s interests, that <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> gained from the 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1930">1930</date></ref>.</p>
                
                <p><persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName>&#x02bc;s personal collection of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> included five autograph letters; and his rare and first&#x2010;edition printed <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, 
                    while not aspiring to comprehensiveness, ranged widely across <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s interests and rhetorical styles 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#METZDORFTINKERLIBRARY"><persName corresp="RFMETZDORF">Metzdorf</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="METZDORFTINKERLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">The Tinker Library</hi></title></ref>, 371&#x2013;74). 
                    He and his students had access, moreover, to a comprehensive <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection belonging to <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="adam_r_b_note.php">R. B. Adam</ref>, 
                    which <persName corresp="#RBA">Adam</persName> donated to <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale University Library</orgName> in <date when="1929">1929</date>, in friendship and in support of <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName>&#x02bc;s tireless advocacy 
                    on behalf of the library&#x02bc;s collections 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HYDEADAMTINKERNEWTON1"><persName corresp="#MHYDE">Hyde</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HYDEADAMTINKERNEWTON1">&#x201C;Adam, Tinker, and Newton&#x201D;</title></ref>, 304). 
                    Equally beneficial to the library&#x02bc;s <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> holdings, if less happily in circumstances, the <placeName corresp="#BOSTON">Boston</placeName> book dealer 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="goodspeed_charles_note.php"><persName corresp="#CG">Charles E. Goodspeed</persName> (<date notBefore="1867" notAfter="1950">1867&#x2013;1950</date>)</ref> 
                    donated the manuscripts in his keeping, which had been damaged by his house fire in <date when="1941">1941</date>. 
                    <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName>, at that time still keeper of rare books and manuscripts, was <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s correspondent during the salvage, 
                    and presumably <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName> helped oversee the care of the scorched items. A decade earlier, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> had served as the primary, 
                    if not perhaps the exclusive mediator for <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>&#x02bc;s acquisitions from the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02bc;s</orgName> <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> sales. 
                    <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> entrusted <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale University Library</orgName> with the remains of his 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection because, it was said, he wished &#x201c;to complete <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>&#x02bc;s holdings of the available major <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts, 
                    so many of which had passed through his hands on their way to <placeName corresp="#NEWHAVEN">New Haven</placeName>&#x201d;
