         <div class="p">The aim of this note is not to attempt an exhaustive listing of books that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> read or consulted in his youth. 
                    Information about <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s reading and its influences is available throughout <i>ERM</i>, 
                    in the apparatuses and glosses of works containing specific allusions to and borrowings from publications to which he was exposed. 
                    Especially influential authors and published sources, moreover, are discussed in notes of their own. 
                    This information can be accessed using the site&#x02BC;s Search.</div>

            <span class="head-section">On Researching Ruskin&#x02BC;s Reading in His Youth</span>
            
            <div class="p">As a preliminary to introducing supplements to <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>&#x02BC;s and 
                        <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span>&#x02BC;s bibliographies, some caveats merit discussion 
                        about what we are able to determine about <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s reading in his youth.</div>
            
            
            <div id="PROVENANCE" class="subsection"> 
               <span class="head-subsection">Provenance</span>
               
               <div class="p">Assuming that the provenance of a copy of printed material can be traced securely to Brantwood, 
                            Ruskin's final home, its presence in his adult library does not necessarily guarantee 
                            that it was available to him during his youth, even if the item's publication date falls within the relevant range. 
                            For example, among Ruskin's supposed boyhood <a href="#BEINECKEBOOKS">books held by the Beinecke Library</a>, 
                            the bindings that enclose together several of these items lack documentation of responsibility, 
                            thus lending only a deceptive appearance of assured provenance to the contents' origins. Juvenile marginalia in some items seem to lend credence, 
                            if only the scribblings could be ascertained to be Ruskin's, whereas mature marginalia that are recognizably in Ruskin's hand 
                            do not necessarily attest to ownership in boyhood. For example, the Beinecke holding of a favorite boyhood book of Ruskin's, 
                            <span class="title-book-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span> 
                            by John Aikin and Anna Laetitia Barbauld, which is annotated in Ruskin's mature hand, is very likely not a copy that he used during his youth. 
                            As in any case for provenance, one can only weigh the evidence.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">The evidence provided by <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>'s ledger of household accounts, 
                            in which he recorded purchases of printed matter, is a huge boon, especially since he noted precise costs. 
                            Burd, comparing these figures against publisher's listings, helpfully tracked down a great many of these items; 
                            however, John James's otherwise sketchy identifications of author and/or title leave some items in doubt.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Moreover, books intended for younger children present special problems in the household accounts. John James's extant Account Book 
                            begins in 1827, omitting the earliest years of John's reading. This would have been the period when many of the juvenile books 
                            were purchased such as those now are held by the Beinecke Library and the Ruskin Library and alleged to have belonged to Ruskin. 
                            Fortunately, some titles are mentioned in the family letters, such as Margaret's suggestions to John James when John was four years old: 
                            "if you bring any thing for him let it be the history of the children of the wood 
                            or Sinbad the Sailor--since he has been ill he has had so much medicine to take that I have been oblighed to buy I don't know how many books 
                            and you might perhaps bring him some he has already&#x005B;.&#x005D; You can bring nothing he will be so well pleased with as a book" 
                            (23 March 1823, Ruskin Family Letters, ed. Burd, 126-27). 
                            The comment reveals that Margaret as well as John James purchased books; and even in the extant accounts, 
                            these may or may not have been recorded. (In the extant Account Book, each year includes a column 
                            "House Expenses &#x0026; paid Mrs R.", but all book purchases are listed along with the miscellaneous items in the column 
                            "Sundries", which does not identify purchasers.) Margaret's comment at least suggests that, when she did acquire reading for John, 
                            she did not necessarily limit her choices to religious and dryly instructive materials.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Books for young readers that John James recorded in his accounts starting in 1827 present another problem since some titles may not have been intended for <span class="persName-JR">John</span>, 
                            but instead for his cousins, especially for 
                  <a href="/notes/richardson_mary_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span> (<span class="date-1815-1849">1815&#x2013;49</span>)</a>, 
                            who lived with the Ruskin family from <span class="date-1828">1828</span> until her marriage in <span class="date-1848">1848</span>. While <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span> comments about the family library that 
                            &#x201C;the books owned by all three Ruskins must be considered to be part of &#x2018;Ruskin&#x02BC;s Library&#x2019; because he ultimately inherited his parents&#x02BC; possessions, 
                            as well as having the use of them during their lifetimes&#x201D;, one wonders how far the availability, much less the inheritance, 
                            extended in the case of <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span>&#x02BC;s books. <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span> is right to conclude with the caveat that, 
                            &#x201C;although <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s lifetime&#x02BC;s library was much greater than it was at any <i>one</i> time, 
                            we do not know its total extent&#x201D; (<a href="/notes/bibliography#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY" target="_self"><span class="title-book-DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><i>Library of John Ruskin</i></span></a>, xv, xxiv). 
                            The most valuable evidence that <i>ERM</i> can contribute to the question of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s reading lies 
                            in the edited texts, which can reveal lexical traces of readings that may have left no material trace in the family record.</div>

               <span class="head-subsection">Reading Owned or Borrowed</span>
               
               
               <div class="p">As <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span> remarks, in adulthood <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> &#x201C;was essentially . . . a book&#x2010;buyer rather than a book borrower or library user&#x201D; 
                        (<a href="/notes/bibliography#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY" target="_self"><span class="title-book-DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><i>Library of John Ruskin</i></span></a>, xix), a habit that appears to have been inherited from his father, 
                        who was generous with purchases of books for his family&#x02BC;s education and entertainment. Still, there is no way of knowing 
                        whether publications that left their influence in the early manuscripts were borrowed or owned, 
                        if otherwise unrecorded as part of the family library in the <span class="date-1820-1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</span>. For example, 
                        <span class="persName-FDH">Felicia Hemans</span> was sufficiently admired for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> to have transcribed her poem, <span class="title-poem-HEMANSSOUNDOFTHESEA">&#x201C;The Sound of the Sea&#x201D;</span> (<span class="date-1826">1826</span>) in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIVB">MS IVB</span>, 
                        probably based on the text as published in the <span class="title-periodical-NEWMONTHLYMAGAZINE"><i>New Monthly Magazine</i></span>. He also adapted passages from <span class="persName-FDH">Hemans</span>&#x02BC;s long poem, 
                        <span class="title-poem-HEMANSRESTORATIONWORKSOFART"><i>The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy</i></span>, published by Murray in <span class="date-1816">1816</span>, for use in his own poem, <span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span>. 
                        Yet <span class="persName-FDH">Mrs. Hemans</span> is curiously absent from records of the Ruskins&#x02BC; book ownership, 
                        apart from poems included in literary annuals that the Ruskins are known to have owned. 
                        How publications by <span class="persName-FDH">Hemans</span> passed through their hands&#x2014;whether by purchase, borrowing, or just casually encountering a periodical outside the house&#x2014;will probably remain a mystery.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p">Borrowing could have provided a means for <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> to control what books entered the house. 
                        She appears to refer to borrowing, for example, when she writes to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> about the novel, 
                        <span class="title-book-BROOKEFOOLOFQUALITY"><i>The Fool of Quality</i></span> (<span class="date-1766-1772">1766&#x2013;72</span>) by <span class="persName-HBROOKE">Henry Brooke</span> (<span class="date-1703-1783">1703&#x2013;83</span>). Since she &#x201C;did not like&#x201D; the novel, 
                        she &#x201C;got the first volume merely to read the History of the three little fishes to <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x201D;. 
                        In this instance, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s renewed encounter with the novel led to &#x201C;the Almighty open&#x005B;ing&#x005D; the understanding&#x201D;, 
                        and she decided to &#x201C;read it together&#x201D; with <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>. Perhaps only then was the full work acquired for the household, 
                        perhaps in the abridgement of the novel by <span class="persName-JWESLEY">John Wesley</span>

               <div class="p">On travels, the Ruskins supplemented books they brought with them by tapping resources along the way; for example, 
                        during the tour of <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span> in <span class="date-1833">1833</span>, when <span class="persName-JR">John</span> fell ill, his father and cousin <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> cheered him up by finding 
                        &#x201C;some English books from a library&#x201D; along with &#x201C;2 or 3 volumes of <span class="title-periodical-GALIGNANISMAGAZINE">Gagliani&#x02BC;s Magazine</span>&#x201D;&#x2014;that is, 
                        one of the periodicals issued by Librairie Galignani, the Paris&#x2010;based English&#x2010;language publisher, bookseller, and circulating library, 
                        which published two monthly journals, the <span class="title-periodical-GALIGNANIREPERTORY"><i>Repertory</i></span> (ca. <span class="date-1807-1825">1807&#x2013;25</span>), and 
                        <span class="title-periodical-GALIGNANISMAGAZINE"><i>Galignani&#x02BC;s Monthly Review and Magazine</i></span> (ca. <span class="date-1822-1825">1822&#x2013;25</span>), 
                        as well as a daily, the <span class="title-periodical-GALIGNANIMESSENGER"><i>Messenger</i></span> (ca. <span class="date-1814-1904">1814&#x2013;1904</span>). 
                        Galignani also published a series, <span class="title-series-STANDARDMODERNNOVELS"><i>Standard Modern Novels and Romances</i></span>, 
                        which supplied English travelers and expatriates with contemporary British poetry and prose. 
                        The editions were issued in duodecimo, a size convenient for travel, but printed using excellent type and engravings, 
                        and edited for correct and complete text&#x2014;in some cases, text more complete and reliable than what could be found in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> editions. 
                        As piracies, the volumes were priced significantly cheaper than corresponding <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> editions, 
                        and sold in paper&#x2010;covered boards&#x2014;volumes that could be shared among travelers at a hotel and left behind for others&#x02BC; enjoyment. 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did retain from boyhood one of Galignani&#x02BC;s outstanding volumes in the series

                        <a href="#DESCRIPTIONS">Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Youth</a>, these classics were mixed in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s juvenile library 
                        with works both secular and Sabbatarian that now seem much more ephemeral. Second, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s retrospection 
                        flattens these readings in time, suggesting that his study even of favored works was both simultaneous and compartmentalized. In fact, even if true that his reading was subject to this weekly division, 
                        his reading was also regulated by competing programs. Moreover, the books themselves and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s responses to them did not necessarily adhere to the categories assigned to them. 
                        As shown in <i>ERM</i> commentary and in the <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, the Ruskins, no less than other middle&#x2010;class families, attempted to follow 
                        the program of graduated, age&#x2010;appropriate reading for children as recommended by educationists like the Barbaulds and Edgeworths. 
                        Yet <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s writings in <i>ERM</i> also reflect his tendency to buck the program, by reading texts above his years 
                        (e.g., <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><i>Scientific Dialogues</i></span>, which he copied verbatim in <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I&#x201D;</span>, but which are too advanced for that context). 
                        Moreover, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and his mother shared weekday reading, in which the religious influences were likely more powerful and memorable to him 
                        (e.g., the <span class="persName-fictional-WHITELADY">White Lady</span> as a protector of Protestantism in <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-SCOTTMONASTERY"><i>The Monastery</i></span>) than the Sunday sermons he attempted to copy.</div>

               <div class="p">In <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="title-book-RFL"><i>The Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, <span class="persName-VAB">Van Akin Burd</span> transcribes <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s brief notations of authors and/or titles that he 
                        purchased each month of every year, from <span class="date-1827-1845">1827 through 1845</span>, in his <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFMS28" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-RFMS28">Account Book</span></a>. In the ledger, 
                        book purchases are included among many other miscellaneous items on the pages devoted to &#x201C;Sundries&#x201D; for each year. 
                        Because <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> notes the amounts spent, <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> is able in many cases to identify the authors/titles 
                        with specific editions available at the time from publishers at those prices. <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>&#x02BC;s transcriptions and annotations are very reliable, 
                        but should nonetheless be revisited and compared against the manuscript of the <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFMS28" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-RFMS28">Account Book</span></a>, 
                        since <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s entries are sometimes ambiguous. Where appropriate, original entries in <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFMS28" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-RFMS28">Account Book</span></a> are referenced throughout <i>ERM</i>. 
                        Here, for convenience of reference, are listed the page numbers in <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a> of <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>&#x02BC;s transcribed lists, 
                        along with the corresponding pages of &#x201C;Sundries&#x201D; in the <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFMS28" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-RFMS28">Account Book</span></a>. Here also are expansions and suggested corrections of <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>&#x02BC;s lists.</div>
               
               
               <div class="p"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> omitted one year of sundry book purchases, those for <span class="date-1830">1830</span>, from <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFL" target="_self"><span class="title-book-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 
                        presumably because no letters are extant from that year, thus giving no occasion for annotation. 
                        <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span> has incorporated the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> purchases into the alphabetized entries in <a href="/notes/bibliography#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY" target="_self"><span class="title-book-DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><i>The Library of John Ruskin</i></span></a>; however, 
                        since <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s book lists organized chronologically by year form a helpful comparison 
                        with the discussions of dating works and manuscripts in <i>ERM</i>, the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> book list is compiled in its entirety, 
                        cross&#x2010;referenced with entries in <a href="/notes/bibliography#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY" target="_self"><span class="title-book-DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><i>The Library of John Ruskin</i></span></a>. This list and others from <span class="date-1827-1845">1827&#x2013;45</span> will be updated 
                        as new information comes to light. More speculatively, annual lists are also compiled 
                        for years prior to the start of <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s <a href="/notes/bibliography#RFMS28" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-RFMS28">Account Book</span></a> in <span class="date-1827">1827</span>.

               <div class="p">Some names are transcribed from <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;Sundries&#x201D; that may or may not refer to books or authors. 
                        <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> often listed names of vendors as shorthand for the wares they supplied, 
                        as well as naming recipients of gifts or purchases. In many cases, it is mere speculation whether a proper name 
                        refers to purchase of a book or of some other kind of item, and these names are flagged as &#x201C;unidentified&#x201D;. 
                        Yet the occurence of some names can sometimes be aligned with other information to identify book titles and authors 
                        at least tentatively. Again, these identifications are ongoing.</div>

                                    This title on the spine applies most legitimately to the first of the items, <span class="title-anthology-MOTHERBUNCHSFAIRYTALES"><i>Mother Bunch&#x02BC;s Fairy Tales</i></span>, 
                                    whereas the other two items belong only marginally, each containing just one or two stories that feature a fairy or fantastical events. 
                                    Regardless of the consistency of the collection, however, an implicit rationale becomes apparent by comparing the contents of another bound collection,

                                    Now highly regarded among collectors, Lumsden&#x02BC;s children&#x02BC;s books are distinguished by 
                                    &#x201C;a certain trimness (primness one might almost call it) in the covers, the quality of the paper used, 
                                    the excellent type&#x2010;face, the occasional use of coloured inks for text and illustrations, 
                                    usually bistre or sanguine, occasionally green, and a few hand&#x2010;coloured illustrations&#x201D;. 
                                    In their own time, however, the books were apparently little known outside of <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>; 
                                    and even in their own country, they were not widely popular, because their prices were considered 
                                    rather dear, even at two pence or six pence per copy&#x2014;cheaper and less elegant chapbooks by this publisher 
                                    being more commonly found

                                            The Lumsden edition was a piracy and abridgement of an English edition

                                            and the Harris editions were in turn based on editions (ca. <span class="date-1773-1799">1773&#x2013;99</span>) published by the firm of John Newbery

                                       Newbery originated the title, <span class="title-anthology-MOTHERBUNCHSFAIRYTALES"><i>Mother Bunch&#x02BC;s Fairy Tales</i></span>, and adapted an earlier English translation 
                                            (<span class="date-1721">1721</span>, reprinted frequently through <span class="date-1817">1817</span>, and including tales by other French salon writers). 
                                            This early eighteenth&#x2010;century English translation, according to <span class="persName-DBLAMIRES">David Blamires</span>, 
                                            was faithful to the original, sophisticated French tales and intended for adult readers. 
                                            The Newbery edition and its descendents simplified the texts for child readers, 
                                            and reassigned the authorship from <span class="persName-COUNTESSDAULNOY">Madame d&#x02BC;Aulnoy</span> to the fictitious Mother Bunch, 
                                            an English folklore figure whom children could imagine as a storyteller 
                                            similar to Mother Goose. Through these successive adaptations of the English texts 
                                            by Newbery, Harris, and Lumsden for an audience of middle&#x2010;class children&#x2014;as well as 
                                            through issues of individual tales in chapbook form for a working&#x2010;class audience&#x2014;the 
                                            French salon fairy tales came be regarded as English and traditional

                                            In the subtitle, first applied by Newbery and carried through the adaptations by Harris and Lumsden, 
                                            the specification that the tales were meant to amuse &#x201C;little masters and misses&#x201D; signals that the tales 
                                            were meant for younger children. For Newbery in the eighteenth century, the purpose of such books was 
                                            to teach children basic reading, as compared with books designated for &#x201C;young gentlemen and ladies&#x201D;,

                                            was apparently based on a collection first published in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, ca. <span class="date-1780">1780</span>

                                            The first story in the collection opens with commentary on the neglect of religion and morality in childhood education, 
                                            but the stories in themselves do little to redress this supposed failing. The collection is miscellaneous, 
                                            some tales teaching prudent and moral conduct, some adopting an oriental flavor, and only a few entailing magic or fairies. 
                                            Two of the latter sort feature dervises (i.e., dervishes), who reward hospitality with magical riches, but retract the reward and punish 
                                            characters who overstep boundaries owing to greed or excess curiosity.<br/><br/>

                                    The responsibility for binding these items together is unknown. A rationale, if not the specific occasion for the collection 
                                    can be inferred, however, if the binding of these eight items was made in concert with the binding of <a href="#FAIRYTALESDISCUSSION">Fairy Tales</a>. 
                                    As compared with the latter, the items collected here share an emphasis on &#x201C;cautionary&#x201D; tales (to draw on the subtitle of <span class="title-book-TURNERTHECOWSLIP"><i>The Cowslip</i></span>). 
                                    Since the early nineteenth century, such Romantic writers as <span class="persName-CLE">Charles Lamb</span>, <span class="persName-STC">S. T. Coleridge</span>, and <span class="persName-WW">William Wordsworth</span> 
                                    had polemically argued in favor of appealing to children&#x02BC;s imagination with fairy tales as opposed to training their reason and morals 
                                    with &#x201C;instructive&#x201D; and &#x201C;cautionary&#x201D; tales and dialogues by the &#x201C;cursed <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span> Crew&#x201D;, as <span class="persName-CLE">Lamb</span> anathematized this group largely of women writers. 
                                    In our time, critics have exposed the politics underpinning these divisions, but in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, 
                                    which was probably when a number of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s childhood books were divided between these two collections, the reputation of 
                                    <span class="persName-ALB">Anna Letitia Barbauld</span> had been disassociated from her politics and reduced to bland high&#x2010;mindedness&#x2014;a &#x201C;valuation&#x201D; 
                                    of this writing that suggests, as <span class="persName-WMCCARTHY">William McCarthy</span> complains, &#x201C;that it entirely lacked humor, irony, or wit&#x201D; 
                                    (<a href="/notes/bibliography#MCCARTHYBARBAULDRECEPTION" target="_self"><span class="persName-WMCCARTHY">McCarthy</span>, <span class="title-essay-MCCARTHYBARBAULDRECEPTION">&#x201C;&#x2018;A High&#x2010;Minded Christian Lady&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></a>, 179; and see

                                    Such a valuation was perhaps implicitly placed on these eight items by binding them together.<br/><br/>
                                    
                                    The reductive valuation would not have been <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s, but it seems unlikely that he could have been responsible for binding this collection 
                                    since, as noted in the following descritions, he annotated some of the items separately, 
                                    bequeathing them to <span class="persName-JSAR">Joan Severn</span> and her children. One of the annotations is dated &#x201C;<span class="date-1889">1889</span>&#x201D;, and another &#x201C;<span class="date-1889-1890">1889&#x2013;1890</span>&#x201D;, 
                                    clues that the binding was ordered after <span class="date-1890">1890</span> by someone other than <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x2014;perhaps by <span class="persName-JSAR">Joan Severn</span>&#x2014;since by that time, 
                                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself would not have been in a mental state to take such an initiative.

                                            The Ruskins regularly traveled to <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>, until <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s <a href="/notes/richardson_jessie_note" target="_self"><span class="persName-JRP">Aunt Jessie</span></a> died in <span class="date-1828">1828</span>.

                                            emphasizing that his youthful markings were to be retained, and to number the volumes 1, 2, and 3, since he had &#x201C;lost the rest&#x201D; of the volumes (quoted in <a href="/notes/bibliography#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY" target="_self"><span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span>, <span class="title-book-"><i>Library of John Ruskin</i></span></a>, 8 &#x005B;no. 34&#x005D;). 
                                            The remaining volumes sent for binding would have been the original volumes 1, 2, and 5, with volumes 3, 4, and 6 gone missing, 
                                            according to details in an <span class="date-1868">1868</span> partial catalogue of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s books, as cited by <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span>. On this evidence, 
                                            <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span> suggests that, since the <span class="persName-FJS">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> copy at the <span class="placeName-building-BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke Library</span> &#x201C;is not bound in the style specified in the letter to Simpson &#x0026; Co.&#x201D;, this volume 
                                            &#x201C;may be one of the volumes which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> mentioned he had lost&#x201D; (<a href="/notes/bibliography#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY" target="_self"><span class="title-book-"><i>Library of John Ruskin</i></span></a>, 8 &#x005B;no. 34&#x005D;, and see cviii&#x2013;cxii). 
                                            This possibility is ruled out, however, since the <span class="persName-FJS">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> copy, which is a six&#x2010;volumes&#x2010;in&#x2010;one edition, complete in itself, cannot have formed a part of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s original set.<br/><br/>
                                 
                                 <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span> gives <span class="date-1792">1792</span> as the year of publication for the <span class="persName-FJS">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> copy, but this date is not supported by the title page, which is undated. 
                                            Its publication by J. F. Dove places it, rather, as a reprint in a series conceived by <span class="persName-JFDOVE">John Fowler Dove</span> (<span class="date-1787-1866">1787&#x2013;1866</span>), <span class="placeName-building-STJOHNSQLONDON">St. John&#x02BC;s Square</span>, <span class="placeName-building-CLERKENWELL">Clerkenwell</span>, <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>.

                                            Instead, the <span class="persName-FJS">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> copy identifies itself as &#x201C;Printed and Published by <span class="persName-JFDOVE">J.

                                            According to <span class="persName-LWORMS">Laurence Worms</span>, this imprint, &#x201C;Printed and Published by <span class="persName-JFDOVE">J. F.

                                            In any case, even if the <span class="persName-JFS">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> copy were the <span class="date-1827">1827</span> <span class="title-series-DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">&#x201C;English Classics&#x201D;</span> version of <span class="title-booK-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span>,

                                            assumed to have served as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s foundational boyhood reading, preceding his study of <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHFRANK"><i>Frank</i></span> and <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span>.

                                            if not presented as a volume in the <span class="title-series-DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">&#x201C;English Classics&#x201D;</span> series&#x2014;would have postdated <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s writing that <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span> most directly inspired,

                                            In an analysis of the publishing history of <span class="title-book-AIKENBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span>, 
                                            <span class="persName-AFYFE">Aileen Fyfe</span> explains that, <span class="date-1792-1823">from 1792 until 1823</span>, the text of the first edition was controlled by the first publisher, <span class="persName-JJPUBLISHER">Joseph Johnson</span>, 
                                            his successor Rowland Hunter, and other publishers to whom Hunter sold shares. In <span class="date-1823">1823</span>, to maintain copyright, the shareholders solicited 
                                            a corrected and slightly expanded edition from <span class="persName-JAIKIN">John Aikin</span>&#x02BC;s son, <span class="persName-AAIKIN">Arthur Aikin</span>, which was published as the thirteenth edition, apparently in six volumes; 
                                            and in <span class="date-1826">1826</span>, an edition rearranged by <span class="persName-JAIKIN">John Aikin</span>&#x02BC;s daughter, <span class="persName-LAIKIN">Lucy Aikin</span>, was published in four volumes. Despite these new editions descending from the original,
                                            &#x201C;from the <span class="date-1823-1826">mid&#x2010;1820s</span>&#x201D;, <span class="persName-AFYFE">Fyfe</span> notes, &#x201C;any publisher could print the original text of <span class="title-book-AIKENBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span>, and a number did so&#x201D;, including 
                                            provincial and Scottish publishers (<span class="persName-AFYFE">Fyfe</span>, <span class="title-essay-FYFECOPYRIGHTS">&#x201C;Copyrights and Competition&#x201D;</span>, 40). If <span class="persName-JFDOVE">Dove</span> waited until <span class="date-1827">1827</span> to reprint <span class="title-book-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings</i></span>, even in its original text, 
                                            he already lagged behind some other publishers.<br/><br/>
                                            
                                            The Ruskins would have entered the market for <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s initial copy of <span class="title-book-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span> 
                                            during the transitional period in the book&#x02BC;s publishing history, between the <span class="date-1820-1826">early&#x2010; and mid&#x2010;1820s</span>, when the Aikins were revising the text in order to extend copyright, 
                                            and when other publishers were issuing reprints of the first edition. At this point, the Ruskins would likely have acquired either the new edition of <span class="date-1823">1823</span> or afterward, 
                                            whose shareholder publishers included (since <span class="date-1815">1815</span>) Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy, who also published the Ruskins&#x02BC; editions of <span class="persName-ME">Maria Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-series-EDGEWORTHEARLYLESSONS">&#x201C;Early Lessons&#x201D;</span> series; 
                                            or they would have purchased a first&#x2010;edition reprint available from non&#x2010;shareholder publishers. At that time, those non&#x2010;shareholder reprints 
                                            would not have included <span class="persName-JFDOVE">Dove</span>&#x02BC;s, since available evidence shows him coming late to the game. Consequently, putting aside the <span class="persName-FJS">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> <span class="persName-JFDOVE">Dove</span> edition&#x2014;undated, but probably after <span class="date-1827">1827</span>&#x2014;we 
                                            cannot determine what state of the text of <span class="title-book-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><i>Evenings at Home</i></span> was availble to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in his boyhood six&#x2010;volume version, whether the revised edition by <span class="persName-AAIKIN">Arthur Aikin</span> or the original descended from the <span class="persName-JJPUBLISHER">Johnson</span>/Hunter shareholders (or even as originally published by <span class="persName-JJPUBLISHER">Johnson</span>/Hunter). 
                                            A good bet may be the revised text of <span class="date-1823">1823</span>, since the shareholders carrying that text, including Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy,produced substantial print runs that sold well 
                                                (see <a href="/notes/bibliography#FYFECOPYRIGHTS" target="_self"><span class="persName-AFYFE">Fyfe</span>, <span class="title-essay-FYFECOPYRIGHTS">&#x201C;Copyrights and Competition&#x201D;</span></a>, 43); and the Ruskins were familiar with Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy 
                                                from their purchase of <span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHFRANK"><i>Frank</i></span> and <span class="title-book-EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span>. 
                                                Definitive evidence, however, must await recovery of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s three stray volumes, as rebound by Simpson.<br/><br/>
                                            
                                            As for the <span class="persName-FJS">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> copy, since it contains annotations by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> from later years, a logical conclusion may be that he acquired this <span class="persName-JFDOVE">Dove</span> edition at some point to replace the lost volumes of his boyhood set, 
                                            at or before the time of sending the surviving copies for rebinding; or, if the <span class="persName-JFDOVE">Dove</span> reprint was a more youthful acquisition, it should be treated as an additional household copy, circa <span class="date-1830">1830</span>. 
                                            While the front endpaper contains illegible scrawls, one of which <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> was tempted to make out to be the letter <i>J</i> and interpret as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s earliest signature,
