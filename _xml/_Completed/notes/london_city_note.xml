                        new docks had been recently completed or were under construction to service the enormous increase in trade. 
                        Over the course of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, rapidly growing congestion at the quays had become untenable, 
                        causing damage to ships, and creating conditions of lax control that resulted in huge losses due to thievery and smuggling. 
                        Consequently, within the first decade of the nineteenth century, a legislative and engineering feat was undertaken to construct extensive new wetdocks, 
                        an accomplishment was celebrated as a testimonial to <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>&#x02BC;s commercial might 
                        (though the new docks would soon be made obsolete by growing size of ships powered by steam). 
                        To manage trade with <placeName corresp="#INDIA">India</placeName>, the new <placeName type="building" corresp="#WESTINDIADOCKS">West India Docks</placeName> were built in the <placeName corresp="#ISLEOFDOGS">Isle of Dogs</placeName>, 
                        and the new <placeName type="building" corresp="#EASTINDIADOCKS">East India docks</placeName> arose at <placeName corresp="#BLACKWALL">Blackwall</placeName>. Closer to the City, 
                        the new <placeName corresp="#LONDONDKS">London Docks</placeName> were built at <placeName corresp="#WAPPING">Wapping</placeName>. As <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was writing his first

                    <p>Initially, <orgName corresp="#RUSKINETAL">Ruskin, Telford and Domecq</orgName> must have done business at the <placeName corresp="#LONDONDKS">London Docks</placeName> in

                        When the monopoly expired, and a free&#x2010;trade legislature was disinclined to renew it, 
                        the case made for the openly competitive <placeName type="building" corresp="#STKATHERINEDOCK">St. Katherine Dock</placeName> was led, among others, by wine merchants 
                        who complained that the <placeName corresp="#LONDONDKS">London Docks</placeName> lacked adequate warehousing for the barrels that now crowded in shipments

                    <!--<p>The appearance of warehouses was determined by &#x201C;requirements of structural
                        stability and fire protection,&#x201D; and remained consistent from the Great Fire of
                        the seventeenth century through the twentieth century. Materials were brick,
                        timber for floors, and tiles or slate for roofs, although cast iron was used for
                        columns and reinforcements from the early 1800s. Of interest for the Ruskin
                        firm, for wine and spirits at the London docks &#x201C;an important feature . . . was
                        the vaults . . . beneath quay level.&#x201D; These were wide barrel vaults resting on
                        stone or cast&#x2010;iron columns (Tucker, &#x201C;Warehouses in Dockland&#x201D; 22, 24, 26). </p>
                    <p>Transport from the city to the docks was at first by omnibus. River steamers were
                        in service by the mid&#x2010;1830s; and soon thereafter, rail lines, among the first in
                        the kingdom, ran to Greenwich and Blackwall (Pearsall, &#x201C;Dockland Transport&#x201D;
                        145&#x2013;46). For John James, the trip would not have been far from the premises of
                        Ruskin, Telford, and Domecq, which were housed in Billiter Street (see City of
                        London).</p>
                    <p>Shortly prior to these
                        developments, Thomas Pennant described Blackwall and Wapping as miles of
                        streets, &#x201C;inhabited by multitudes of seafaring men, alternate occupants of sea
                        and land: their floating tenements . . . before them. In fact, the whole river,
                        from the bridge, for a vast way, is covered with a double forest of masts, with
                        a narrow avenue in mid-channel&#x201D; (Pennant, <hi rend="italic">History of
                            London</hi> 2:56).</p>-->
