                    this celebrated Congregationalist preacher, who was the Ruskins&#x02bc; clergyman when they attended Dissenting chapel, and who served as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s first tutor, 
                    instructing him from age ten in Latin and Greek. <persName corresp="EA">Andrews</persName> and his wife <persName corresp="#EHSA">Elizabeth</persName> (<date notBefore="1792" notAfter="1831"> 1792&#x2013;1831</date>) bore twelve children, of whom the eldest daughter, <persName corresp="EAO">Eliza</persName> (<date notBefore="1816" notAfter="1892"> 1816&#x2013;92</date>), 
                    appears to have had some connection with the Ruskins during <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02bc;s youth. Eliza&#x02bc;s younger sister, <persName corresp="#EAP">Emily Augusta</persName> (<date notBefore="1824" notAfter="1862">1824&#x2013;62</date>), 
                    married <persName corresp="#CKDP">Coventry Patmore</persName> (<date notBefore="1823" notAfter="1896">1823&#x2013;96</date>) and became known as the eponymous heroine of <persName corresp="#CKDP">Patmore</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="poem" corresp="#PATMOREANGEL"><hi rend="italic">Angel in the House</hi></title>.</p>

                    she sang <title type="poem" corresp="#BYRONTAMBOURGI">&#x2018;Tambourgi, Tambourgi&#x2019;</title> with great spirit and a rich voice, went at blackberry time on rambles with us at the <placeName type="building" corresp="#NORWOODSPA">Norwood Spa</placeName>, 
                    and made me feel generally that there was something in girls that I did not understand, and that was curiously agreeable&#x201d;. 
                    As noted by the editors of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>, <persName corresp="#EAO">Eliza</persName>, as Mrs. <persName corresp="#CO">Charles Orme</persName>, maintained a salon, which was frequented by the <orgName corresp="#PRB">Pre&#x2010;Raphaelites</orgName>

                <p>Some verse by <persName corresp="#EAO">Eliza</persName>, <title type="poem" corresp="#ANDREWSELIZABRAVEHUSSAR">&#x201C;The Brave Hussar&#x201D;</title>, was copied by

                    The eldest son, <persName corresp="#EASON">Edward</persName>, contributed poetry to his father&#x02bc;s short&#x2010;lived periodical, <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title>, 
                    which was also the venue for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s first published poems 
                    (see <ref type="apparatus" target="on_skiddaw_and_derwentwater_apparatus#DISCUSSION.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D;: Discussion</title></ref>.</p>
                
                <p>A daughter of <persName corresp="#EAO">Eliza</persName> and <persName corresp="#CO">Charles Orme</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1807" notAfter="1893">1807&#x2013;93</date>, also named <persName corresp="#EO">Eliza Orme</persName> (<date notBefore="1848" notAfter="1937">1848&#x2013;1937</date>), earned the degree of LLB from the <orgName corresp="#UNIVERSITYOFLONDON">University of London</orgName> 
                    and was a practicing lawyer, as well as a feminist and writer on women&#x02bc;s issues. Her relevance to <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> 
                    lies in her sharing a rare copy of her grandfather&#x02bc;s magazine, the <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title>, 
                    with <persName corresp="#HRN">H. Robertson Nicoll</persName>, enabling him to track down <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s first publications, the two poems that appeared in its pages in <date when="1829">1829</date> and <date when="1830">1830</date> (see 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="on_skiddaw_and_derwentwater_apparatus.php#REDISCOVERYBYNICOLL">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D;: <persName corresp="#HRN">Nicoll</persName>&#x02BC;s Discovery of the <hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi> Ruskin Publications</ref>). 
                    Since <persName corresp="#EO">Eliza Orme</persName> was unmarried and lived with her parents until their deaths in <date when="1892">1892</date> and <date when="1893">1893</date> (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ORMEDNB"><persName corresp="#LHOWSAM">Howsam</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#ORMEDNB">&#x201C;Orme, Eliza [<date notBefore="1848" notAfter="1937">1848&#x2013;1937</date>]&#x201D;</title></ref>), 
                    she perhaps was custodian of this legacy of her grandfather. <persName corresp="#HRN">Nicoll</persName> published his findings in <date when="1895">1895</date>.
