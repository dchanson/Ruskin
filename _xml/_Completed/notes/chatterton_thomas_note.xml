                <head type="title"><persName corresp="#TCPOET">Thomas Chatterton</persName> (<date notBefore="1752" notAfter="1770">1752&#x2013;70</date>)</head>
                <p>Poet and forger. <persName corresp="#TCPOET">Chatterton</persName> was born in <placeName corresp="#BRISTOL">Bristol</placeName>, where he entered a charity school at age eight and soon began to exhibit precocious learning. 
                    By age twelve, he launched his elaborate forgery scheme of composing works he attributed to a <date notBefore="1400" notAfter="1499">fifteenth&#x2010;century</date> priest, <persName corresp="#TRPriest">Thomas Rowley</persName>, 
                    and producing material evidence using scraps of old parchment. Ambitious to make a literary career, at age seventeen he threatened suicide in order 
                    to dissolve his apprenticeship as a legal scrivener to a <placeName corresp="#BRISTOL">Bristol</placeName> attorney. Less successfully, he attempted to use his <persName corresp="#TRPriest">Rowley</persName> forgeries to capture the patronage of the antiquarian, 
                    <persName corresp="#HW">Horace Walpole</persName> (<date notBefore="1717" notAfter="1797">1717&#x2010;97</date>), but <persName corresp="#HW">Walpole</persName> recognized the imposture. <persName corresp="#TCPOET">Chatterton</persName> set out for <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, where he began to rise rapidly in reputation as a free&#x2010;lance writer, 
                    but his career was abruptly cut off by a poisoning, which <persName corresp="#NG">Nick Groom</persName> attributes to misjudged mixing of recreational opium with arsenic treatment for venereal disease 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CHATTERTONDNB"><persName corresp="#NG">Groom</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#CHATTERTONDNB">&#x201C;Chatterton, Thomas (<date notBefore="1752" notAfter="1770">1752&#x2010;70</date>)&#x201D;</title></ref>).
                </p>
                <p>As a Romantic mythology developed around the figure of <persName corresp="#TCPOET">Chatterton</persName>, competing ideas of what he represented were available in the decades following his death, 
                    as <persName corresp="#DF">David Fairer</persName> describes. In one idea, he was not a boy but a &#x201C;manly&#x201D; youth, and a fearless defender of political liberty. 
                    Alternatively, some emphasized his role as victim, spurned by the haughty <persName corresp="#HW">Walpole</persName> and abandoned by society to die in a garret, 
                    a rare and neglected poetic spirit. In the idea of <persName corresp="#TCPOET">Chatterton</persName>&#x02BC;s victimization, the satiric mode shades into the &#x201C;lyric&#x2010;descriptive&#x201D;,
                    as <persName corresp="#DF">Fairer</persName> puts it, with fragile flower imagery predominating, and with a tendency to present <persName corresp="#TCPOET">Chatterton</persName>&#x02BC;s poetic voice as disembodied. 
                    Finally, a dramatic mode imagined the horrors and suffering of what was commonly believed to have been the youth&#x02BC;s suicidal death
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FAIRERCHATTERTON"><persName corresp="#DF">Fairer</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#FAIRERCHATTERTON">&#x201C;Chatterton&#x02BC;s Poetic Afterlife, <date notBefore="1770" notAfter="1794">1770&#x2013;1794&#x201D;</date></title></ref>, 232&#x2010;40).
                </p>
                <p>Of these modes, it was the lyric&#x2010;descriptive, and the idea of <persName corresp="#TCPOET">Chatterton</persName> as victim, which <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> suggests when invoking the myth of the spurned poet 
                    in an <date>1834</date> letter to <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="hogg_james_note.php"><persName corresp="#JH">James Hogg</persName> (ca.<date notBefore="1770" notAfter="1835">1770&#x2013;1835</date>)</ref>. 
                    While not naming <persName corresp="#TCPOET">Chatterton</persName>, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> draws on the mythology surrounding the boy poet when broaching the question of whether <persName corresp="#JJR">John Ruskin</persName> 
                    was truly a youthful genius and poet in the making; and if so, what he and <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> should do to protect and nurture the boy&#x02BC;s talent: 
                    &#x201C;we dread the sacrifice of our offspring by making him a victim to the pangs of despised verse, a sacrifice to a thankless world, 
                    who read, admire, and trample on the greatest and the best&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GARDENMEMORIALS"><persName corresp="#MGHGARDEN">Garden</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#GARDENMEMORIALS"><hi rend="italic">Memorials of James Hogg</hi></title></ref>, 275).
                </p>
                <p>The extent to which <persName corresp="#TCPOET">Chatterton</persName> was present in the Ruskins&#x02BC; imagination is difficult to judge. 
                    While the &#x201C;marvellous boy,&#x201D; in <persName corresp="#WW">Wordsworth</persName>&#x02BC;s phrase, had become inextricably bound to the Romantics&#x02BC; idea of literary precocity, 
                    suicide was a particularly unwelcome topic in the Ruskin family, 
                    owing to the death of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s father, 
                    <persName corresp="#JTR">John Thomas Ruskin</persName> (<date notBefore="1761" notAfter="1817">1761&#x2010;1817</date>), by his own hand, 
                    a suicide that occurred when <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> was on the premises.  
                    It is possible that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> originally composed his elegiac poem, 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="twas_night_i_stood_by_tweeds_fair_stream_apparatus.php">&#x201C;&#x02BC;Twas night. I stood by Tweed&#x02BC;s fair stream&#x201D;</ref>, 
                    in <date when="1831">1831</date> in reference to <persName corresp="#TCPOET">Chatterton</persName>, but altered details to refer instead 
                    to <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="scott_walter_note.php"><persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName> (<date notBefore="1771" notAfter="1832">1771&#x2013;1832</date>)</ref>, 
                    when the Scottish poet died a short time later. 
                    In the draft of the poem, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> named the <placeName corresp="#AVONRIVER">Avon River</placeName>, which flows through <placeName corresp="#BRISTOL">Bristol</placeName>, 
                    but then he changed the river&#x02BC;s name to the <geogName corresp="#TWEEDRIVER">Tweed</geogName>.
                </p> 
                <p>Years later, in his <title type="essay" corresp="#RUSKINACADEMYNOTES"><hi rend="italic">Academy Notes</hi></title> for <date>1856</date>, 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> admired the painting of the poet&#x02BC;s suicide by <persName corresp="#HWPAINTER">Henry Wallis</persName> (<date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1916">1830&#x2013;1916</date>), but wrote about it in very general terms, exhorting viewers to &#x201C;examine it well inch by inch,&#x201D; 
                    for the sake of its &#x201C;entire placing before your eyes of an actual fact&#x2014;and that a solemn one&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 14: 60). 
                    Just as this picture would soon become associated with the scandal that developed between its painter and the wife of its model, 
                    <persName corresp="#GM">George Meredith</persName> (<date notBefore="1828" notAfter="1909">1828&#x2010;1909</date>), another aspect of the <persName corresp="#TCPOET">Chatterton</persName> myth perhaps became disturbingly pertinent to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x2014;the poet&#x02BC;s androgynous and permanent boyishness, 
                    asexual and unwed (contrary to the historical <persName corresp="#TCPOET">Chatterton</persName>&#x02BC;s promiscuity). As <persName corresp="#JCCRITIC">Julie Crane</persName> concludes, 
                    &#x201C;for the Victorians, whose plots used marriage as a device, [yet] for whom in their lives . . . [marriage] was often a disaster, . . . 
                    the pre&#x2010;Romantic <persName corresp="#TCPOET">Chatterton</persName> became a Romantic figure of disturbing possibilities: both endlessly fecund and self&#x2010;dividing into different ways and suggestivenss; 
                    and a silenced being, unwed, austere&#x201D;
