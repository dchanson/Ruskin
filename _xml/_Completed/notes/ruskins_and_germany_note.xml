                <p>The attitude toward German culture reflected in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early travel writing is divided between Romantic attraction to German legends and landscape 
                    and haughty condescension to its people. In the <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php"><title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</title></ref>, 
                    German romance colors the poetry, while invective against German vulgarity flashes out in the essays, such as

                <p>The Ruskins first visited <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName> during the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1833.php">Tour of 1833</ref>. Leading up to that journey,
                    <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> purchased books about the region in <date when="1831">1831</date> and <date when="1832">1832</date>, which are unidentified; 
                    a work by <persName corresp="#JCFS">Friedrich Schiller</persName> in <date when="1832">1832</date>; and a German dictionary and a grammar, respectively in <date when="1832">1832</date> and <date when="1833">1833</date>. 
                    Following their return from the tour, he acquired a &#x201C;P. Rhine&#x201D; in <date when="1834">1834</date>, which was probably

                    by <persName corresp="#EBL">Edward Bulwer&#x2010;Lytton</persName> (<date notBefore="1803" notAfter="1873">1803&#x2013;73</date>), published in that year

                    In visual culture, <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName> and the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> provided prominent subjects in engravings, lithographs, 
                    and watercolors by the Ruskins&#x02BC; favorite artists, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="prout_samuel_note.php"><persName corresp="#SP">Samuel Prout</persName></ref>, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="turner_j_m_w_note.php"><persName corresp="#JMWT">J. M. W. Turner</persName></ref>, and others.</p>
                <!--<p>Prior to this journey, Ruskin's notions of Germany would have been based primarily on his reading of Grimm</p>-->
                <p>Despite this interest, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s parents had always regarded German culture with ambivalence. In his youth, at age sixteen 
                    in <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName>, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> had acted a part in an amateur staging of 
                    <title type="drama" corresp="LEWISCASTLESPECTRE"><hi rend="italic">Castle Spectre</hi></title> (<date when="1797">1797</date>) by <persName corresp="#MGL">Matthew Gregory (&#x201C;Monk&#x201D;) Lewis</persName> 
                    (<date notBefore="1775" notAfter="1818">1775&#x2013;1818</date>), the most lionized and yet most reviled British imitator of the German terrible sublime. As Ruskin family lore had it 
                    according to <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERTIA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s performance stirred his future fianc&#x00E9;e, 
                    <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>, with admirmation of the handsome figure he cut onstage in his romantic costume, despite her religious antipathy to &#x201C;theatricals&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <hi rend="italic"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title></hi></ref>, 38). In the course of their long engagement, however, 
                    <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> came round to <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>>&#x02BC;s contempt for the Gothic sublime. In a letter of 
                    <title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_mr_1813-03-04"><date when="1813-03-04">4 March 1813</date></title> (part of which is missing), <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> satirizes 
                    <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#SCOTTROKEBY"><hi rend="italic">Rokeby</hi></title>, in which &#x201C;bloodthirsty&#x201D; characters 
                    &#x201C;always threaten &#x0026; announce more than they perform&#x201D;, whereas the sentimental boy <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WILFRIDWYCLIFFE">Wilfrid</persName> 
                    &#x201C;is very tender hearted, mild, shy, innocent, amorous, &#x0026; sickly, very studious moreover&#x201D;, prone to &#x201C;sitting up all night hearing the wind howl &#x0026; 
                    looking at the moon&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;going like other folks to bed&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL">Ruskin Family Letters</title></hi></ref>, 60). 
                    The description of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WILFRIDWYCLIFFE">Wilfrid</persName> is prophetic of the teenage <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> twenty years later; 
                    at the time, however, the epithet &#x201C;sickly&#x201D; was grimly applied to German drama by British critics, who warned that the importation of these plays would expose the British public 
                    to political subversion and moral depravity.</p>
                <p>Starting in the <date notBefore="1790" notAfter="1799">1790s</date> and extending through the <date notBefore="1799-11-09" notAfter="1815-06-18">Napoleonic Era</date>, 
                    British fears of invasion by the French extended to anxieties about &#x201C;contamination&#x201D; by German romance, which was imported in the form of translations of tragedies and melodramas 
                    by <persName corresp="#JCFS">Schiller</persName>, <persName corresp="#AFFK">Kotzebue</persName>, and <persName corresp="#JWG">Goethe</persName>, and of translations and adaptations of Romantic 
                    ballads such as <title type="poem" corresp="#BURGERLENORE">&#x201C;Lenore&#x201D;</title> by <persName corresp="#GAB">G. A. B&#x00FC;rger</persName>. As <persName corresp="#PM">Peter Mortensen</persName> 
                    has argued, British authors attracted to the German sublime in drama and the ballad had to reckon with a British xenophobic reaction, while at the same time capitalizing on the fashion 
                    for German literary supernaturalism (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MORTENSENEUROPHOPIA"><title type="book" corresp="#MORTENSENEUROPHOPIA"><hi rend="italic">British Romanticism and Continental Influences</hi></title></ref>, 26&#x2013;27, 46). 
                    <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName> was caught in this dilemma early in his career as a poet, when <persName corresp="#MGL">Lewis</persName> invited him to contribute 
                    his translations of German ballads to the collection, <title type="anthology" corresp="#LEWISTALESOFWONDER"><hi rend="italic">Tales of Wonder</hi></title> (<date when="1800">1800</date>). 
                    <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> did not, however, take the risk of appearing among scandalous and allegedly &#x201C;Jacobinical&#x201D; company merely for the sake of success in the literary market; 
                    like some other British poets, such as <persName corresp="#RS">Robert Southey</persName>, <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> was drawn to German poetry in the belief that it shared 
                    a common heritage with Scottish poetry, and that the fashion for the German sublime could aid in the renewal of British poetry, which he considered moribund. 
                    For <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, this ideological orientation to the past seems a significant, if indirect connection with German Romantic literary culture 
                    than is apparent in the superficial prejudice against &#x201C;German brains&#x201D; that he gathered from his father.</p>
                <p>For <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>, this ideological tie to <persName corresp="#MGL">Lewis</persName> and the German sublime is revealed in the series of biographical prefaces 
                    he added to his major poems in <date when="1830">1830</date>, starting with the <title type="essay" corresp="#SCOTTESSAYONIMITATIONS">&#x201C;Essay on Imitations of the Ancient Ballad&#x201D;</title> 
                    prefacing the fourth volume of <title type="anthology" corresp="#SCOTTMINSTRELSY"><hi rend="italic">Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</hi></title>. By this time, German literature had shed its stigma 
                    for British readers, and <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> was able to disassociate his youthful pursuit from French political freethinking. His study of German language and poetics brought an 
                    &#x201C;unexpected discovery of an old friend in a foreign land&#x201D;, which promised an &#x201C;emancipation from the rules so servilely adhered to by the French school, . . . 
                    particularly by their dramatic poets&#x201D;; and while this affiliation brought &#x201C;some disadvantages&#x201D; in the form of German &#x201C;extravagance and bombast&#x201D;, 
                    <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> and his associates in <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName> anticipated that the &#x201C;prevailing taste in . . . 
                    [<placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName>] might be easily employed as a formidable auxiliary to renewing the spirit of our own, upon the same system as when medical persons 
                    attempt, by the transfusion of blood, to pass into the veins of an aged and exhausted patient, the vivacity of the circulation and liveliness of sensation which distinguish a young subject&#x201D;. 
                    <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s access to this new blood was fortuitously encouraged by his acquaintance with <persName corresp="#MGL">&#x201C;Monk&#x201D; Lewis</persName>, 
                    whose &#x201C;education abroad&#x201D; had afforded &#x201C;an opportunity of indulging his inclination for the extraordinary and supernatural, by wandering through the whole enchanted land 
                    of German fa&#x00EB;ry and <hi rend="italic">diablerie</hi>, not forgetting the paths of her enthusiastic tragedy and romantic poetry&#x201D;. <persName corresp="#MGL">Lewis</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    influence could help add &#x201C;a new string to the British harp&#x201D;, as he was already a popularly &#x201C;successful imitator of the Germans, both in his attachment to the ancient ballad, 
                    and in the tone of superstition which they [the German poets] willingly mingle with it&#x201D;; and he was a &#x201C;martinet, if I may so term him, in the accuracy of rhymes and of numbers&#x201D; 
                    and his &#x201C;command over the melody of verse&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SCOTTESSAYONIMITATIONS"><persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#SCOTTESSAYONIMITATIONS">&#x201C;Essay on Imitations of the Ancient Ballad&#x201D;</title>, ed. Thomson</ref>, n.p.).</p>
                <p>Other participants in this movement included <persName corresp="#RS">Robert Southey</persName>, whose ballads in an ancient style were admired by the <orgName corresp="#NORWICHSCHOOL">Norwich School</orgName> 
                    of poets, which included the most successful English translator of <persName corresp="#GAB">B&#x00FC;rger</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#BURGERLENORE">&#x201C;Lenore&#x201D;</title>, 
                    <persName corresp="#WTPOET">William Taylor</persName> (<date notBefore="1765" notAfter="1836">1765&#x2013;1836</date>). <persName corresp="#DCHANDLER">David Chandler</persName> 
                    has illuminated how this context brings into focus <persName corresp="#RS">Southey</persName>&#x02BC;s rivalry with <persName corresp="#STC">S. T. Coleridge</persName> over the ballad revival, 
                    which has been perceived as merely personal in its motivation on <persName corresp="#RS">Southey</persName>&#x02BC;s part. In his approach to literary revival, <persName corresp="#RS">Southey</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    &#x201C;recipe for a modern supernatural ballad&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#DCHANDLER">Chandler</persName> explains, &#x201C;was to take a genuinely old story concerned with a supernatural event 
                    and to write it as if with complete faith in its credibility, &#x2018;in the spirit of the elder poets&#x2019;&#x201D;. It was in defense of this approach that <persName corresp="#RS">Southey</persName> 
                    scorned <persName corresp="#STC">Coleridge</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#STCANCIENTMARINER">&#x201C;The Ancient Mariner&#x201D;</title> 
                    as &#x201C;a Dutch attempt at German sublimity&#x201D;. <persName corresp="#DCHANDLER">Chandler</persName> concludes that &#x201C;what <persName corresp="#RS">Southey</persName> 
                    with professional rivalry dismissed as a &#x2018;Dutch attempt&#x2019;, and <persName corresp="#CLE">[Charles] Lamb</persName> more generously defended as an &#x2018;English attempt&#x2019; 
                    at &#x2018;German sublimity&#x2019;, is a poem [&#x2018;<title type="poem" corresp="#STCANCIENTMARINER">The Ancient Mariner</title>&#x2019;] particularly apt for critics who read the past as continuous with the present 
                    and believe in the power of tradition. On the other hand, <persName corresp="#RS">Southey</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x2018;answer&#x2019;, an attempt at genuine &#x2018;German sublimity&#x2019; 
                    [his ballad, <title type="poem" corresp="RSOLDWOMANOFBERKELEY">&#x2018;The Old Woman of Berkeley&#x2019;</title>], is a poem for critics who see the past as discontinuous with the present, 
                    but recoverable in part through an effort of difficult, but rewarding, sympathetic identification&#x201D; 
                    (<persName corresp="#DCHANDLER">Chandler</persName>, <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CHANDLERSOUTHEYSGERMANSUBLIMITY">&#x201C;<title type="essay" corresp="#CHANDLERSOUTHEYSGERMANSUBLIMITY">Southey&#x02BC;s &#x2018;German Sublimity&#x2019; and Coleridge&#x02BC;s &#x2018;Dutch Attempt&#x2019;&#x201D;</title></ref>, pars. 12, 15).</p>
                <p>Despite <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s abiding dismissiveness of German &#x201C;metaphysics&#x201D;, this contest of ideas presents an intriguing background 
                    against which to compare his mature thinking about tradition and revivalism. In his youth, however, such ideas lay beyond the simpler conflicts in his attitudes about the German culture 
                    he encountered abroad. He had always been strongly drawn to the Gothic elements in <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#BYRONMANFRED"><hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi></title> and <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY"><hi rend="italic">Monastery</hi></title> 
                    and the poems. Nonetheless, he parroted his father&#x02BC;s contempt for German tourists encountered during the <ref type="note" target="tour_of_1833_note.php">Tour of 1833</ref>, 
                    whom <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> caricatured as a &#x201C;Nation&#x201D; supposed to be &#x201C;fond of the sublime &#x0026; beautiful &#x0026; terrific&#x201D;
