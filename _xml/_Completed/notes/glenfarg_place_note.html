         <div class="p">The growing fame of the picturesque attraction can be traced in successive guidebooks. 
                    In the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>, when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composed his poems,

                    &#x201C;readers on a series of tours&#x201D; through <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> 
                    (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#TOURISMANDIDENTITY" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-book-TOURISMANDIDENTITY"><i>Tourism and Identity in Scotland</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 66). 
                    In <span class="title-book-SCOTTISHTOURIST"><i>The Scottish Tourist</i></span> (<span class="date-1825">1825</span>), the traveler coming south from <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> 
                    is alerted to the glen as &#x201C;a romantic little valley embosomed by the <span class="geogName-OCHILS">Ochils</span>&#x201D;. These hills 
                    are characterized as &#x201C;dwarfish when compared with the lofty <span class="geogName-GRAMPIANS">Grampians</span>&#x201D; to the north; 
                    yet, because the <span class="placeName-OCHILS">Ochils</span> &#x201C;present a smooth surface, and are clothed to their summits with the deepest verdure, possessing also a pastoral serenity and softness&#x201D;, 
                    the scene imparts &#x201C;a new and pleasurable tone to the mind of the tourist, who returns from contemplating the magnificence of <span class="geogName-SCOTTISHHIGHLANDS">Highland</span> scenery&#x201D; 
                    (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#SCOTTISHTOURIST" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-book-SCOTTISHTOURIST"><i>The Scottish Tourist, and Itinerary</i></span> &#x005B;3d ed., <span class="date-1830">1830</span>&#x005D;&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 125).</div>
         
         
         <div class="p">In later accounts, rather than being regarded as easing the spectator down from the grandeur of the <span class="geogName-SCOTTISHHIGHLANDS">Highlands</span>, 
                    the glen takes on its own share of the sublime. When approached from the south, riding north from the <span class="geogName-FIRTHOFFORTH">Firth of Forth</span>&#x2014;the direction 
                    traveled by the Ruskins when first encountering <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Glenfarg</span> during a tour&#x2014;the glen presented 
                    &#x201C;certainly the finest portion of the journey, and perhaps the only bit of grand scenery that is to be met with on the road 
                    between <span class="placeName-QUEENSFERRY">Queensferry</span> and the <span class="placeName-building-EARNBRG">Bridge of Earn</span>&#x201D;, 
                    according to a travel writer in the <span class="date-1880-1889">1880s</span>. Prior to reaching the glen, in this writer&#x02BC;s experience, the landscape traversed by the 
                    &#x201C;<span class="placeName-building-GNR">Great North Road</span> between <span class="placeName-KINROSSVILLAGE">Kinross</span> and <span class="placeName-DAMHEAD">Damhead</span> &#x005B;i.e., the village of <span class="geogName-GLENFARGVILLAGE">Glenfarg</span>&#x005D;,

                    being bleak and solitary, without any of those grander features which often impart an interest to a wild and unfrequented country&#x201D;. 
                    Beyond <span class="placeName-DAMHEAD">Damhead</span>, however, &#x201C;the <span class="placeName-building-GNR">Great North Road</span> skirts the <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Farg</span>&#x201D;, the road &#x201C;descend&#x005B;ing alongside the river&#x005D; between the wood&#x2010;clad sides of the magnificent glen&#x201D;

         <div class="p">By the early twentieth century, when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poems about <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Glenfarg</span> had become available in print, 
                    a guidebook devoted specifically to &#x201C;the famous glen&#x201D; and its environs, <span class="title-book-JACKGLENFARG"><i>Glenfarg and District Past and Present</i></span>, 
                    touted how the route had been highlighted by northbound celebrity travelers, ranging from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>

                    In the <span class="date-1908">1908</span> edition of the guidebook, the glen is credited with having drawn forth the young <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;descriptive powers&#x201D; 
                    when he passed through the valley &#x201C;on a winter&#x02BC;s day when the rocks were hung with icicles&#x201D;. This allusion to Ruskin&#x02BC;s poem, 
                    is expanded in a later edition of the guidebook (ca. <span class="date">1930s</span>), 
                    quoting at length from &#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/apparatuses/glenfarg_apparatus" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="title-poem-GLENFARG">&#x201C;Glenfarg&#x201D; <i>and</i> &#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Papa how pretty those icicles are&#x201D;)</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;. 
                    For royal testimonials to the beauty of the glen, the guidebook quotes <span class="persName-KL1">Leopold of Saxe&#x2010;Coburg</span>, who,

                    although &#x201C;the building which then formed the inn&#x201D; was said to stand &#x201C;a little farther down the hill than the . . . caravanserai&#x201D; that presently stands

                    The coaches came from <span class="placeName-KINROSSVILLAGE">Kinross</span> via <span class="placeName-MILNATHORT">Milnathort</span>, <span class="placeName-MIDDLETON">Middleton</span>, <span class="placeName-NEWHILL">Newhill</span> and <span class="placeName-LANGSIDE">Langside</span>; 
                    and in the village, horses were changed at the <span class="placeName-building-PUNCHBOWLINN">Punch Bowl Inn</span>

                    Despite these services, the condition of the road that the Ruskins would have followed along the <span class="geogName-FARG">Farg</span> in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> is unclear, 
                    for although &#x201C;the <span class="placeName-building-GNR">Great North &#x005B;Road&#x005D;</span> . . . from <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span> to <span class="placeName-ABERDEEN">Aberdeen</span> was engineered in <span class="date-1808-1810">1808&#x2013;1810</span>,

                    In any case, the route through the village formed a section of &#x201C;the old coaching&#x2010;ro andad from <span class="placeName-QUEENSFERRY">Queensferry</span> to <span class="placeName-">Perth</span>. . . . 
                    Beyond the glen, the road led to a pass over the <span class="geogName-OCHILS">Ochils</span> known as the <span class="placeName-WICKSOFBAIGLIE">Wicks of Baiglie</span>, which was 
                    associated with a prospect of <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> as described in <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-SCOTTFAIRMAIDOFPERTH"><i>The Fair Maid of Perth</i></span>, 
                    although the exact situation of this view and of the area named the <span class="placeName-WICKSOBAIGLIE">Wicks</span> became matters of speculation

         <div class="p">In his poems about <span class="placeName-GLENFARG">Glenfarg</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> took note of a local industry, mentioning &#x201C;floury mills&#x201D;

                    In <span class="date-1869">1869</span>, when he printed the latter poem in <span class="title-book-JRQUEENAIR"> Queen of the Air</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> annotated the line describing the water mill, &#x201C;Political Economy of the Future!&#x201D;

                    In the <span class="date-1840-1849">1840s</span>, the <span class="geogName-FARG">Farg</span> valley was still active with four mills for grinding corn, twenty&#x2010;two thrashing mills, and a sawmill; 
                    however, as the century advanced, the local industry declined. According to the <span class="date-1908">1908</span> edition of the <span class="geogName-">Glenfarg</span> guidebook, local mills were undercut by cheap imported flour,  
                    which even &#x201C;after paying all carriage dues, could be sold at the miller&#x02BC;s door for less price than he could produce it&#x201D;. 
                    The meal and flour mills are described as having long been closed, their &#x201C;decaying walls&#x201D; along the <span class="geogName-FARG">Farg</span> &#x201C;now silent as the grave, save when the winds sigh eerily&#x201D; through them; 
                    and whereas the <span class="date-1908">1908</span> edition of the guidebook could still point to 
                    &#x201C;old people . . . in our parish&#x201D; who remembered the mills, the <span class="date-1930">1930s</span> edition concluded that &#x201C;no one now lives who was familiar with these meal mills in our parish&#x201D;

         <div class="p">While the perception that local goods were undersold by mass production was partly true, however, the causes of the decline were more complex. 
                    &#x201C;From the <span class="date-1760-1840">Industrial Revolution</span> through the <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth century</span>, demand increased for a whiter wheaten loaf at the expense of wholemeal wheat, barley, or rye bread&#x201D;&#x2014;the 
                    more refined bread believed at the time to be healthier. Simultaneously, changes in technology displaced stone mills with more efficient &#x201C;roller&#x201D; mills, 
                    which favored &#x201C;harder imported wheat&#x201D; over the &#x201C;<span class="placeName-BRITAIN">British</span>&#x2010;grown softer grains&#x201D; that ground well by stone. Bakers also preferred imported &#x201C;strong <span class="geogName-NORTHAMERICA">North American</span>, <span class="placeName-EASTEUROPE">Eastern European</span>, and <span class="placeName-RUSSIA">Russian</span> flours&#x201C; 
                    since these &#x201C;produced a well&#x2010;risen loaf with less flour&#x201D;, increasing bakers&#x02BC; profits. Researchers of this history 
                    appreciate the &#x201C;irony in considering the <span class="date-1875-01-01-1900-12-31">late&#x2010;nineteenth&#x2010;century</span> revolution in milling with its attendant transformation in consumption patterns 
                    when, a century later, a reversal in consumption is taking with an increasing demand for stone&#x2010;ground wholemeal flour, some of it produced in restored country water mills&#x201D; 
                    (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#TANN-JONESTECHNOLOGYANDTRANSFORMATION" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-JTANN">Tann</span> and <span class="persName-RGJONES">Jones</span>, <span class="title-essay-TANN-JONESTECHNOLOGYANDTRANSFORMATION">&#x201C;Technology and Transformation&#x201D;</span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 66&#x2013;67). Ruskin would likewise have appreciated the irony&#x2014;and approved the reversal.</div>
         
         
         <div class="p"><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would also have regretted the transformation of <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Glenfarg</span> brought about by the rail line laid through the glen.
                    The early twentieth&#x2010;century guidebooks to <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Glenfarg</span> were designed to vest the future economy of the region in 
                    &#x201C;developing into a healthy, attractive summer resort&#x201D;, supported by rail service and other new amenities

                    Dismal as he would have considered that prospect, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s early poems do at least confirm the guidebooks&#x02BC; claim that &#x201C;the air&#x201D; of <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Glenfarg</span> &#x201C;is generally clear and dry, 
                    when <span class="geogName-STRATHEARN">Strathearn</span> and <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> are enveloped in mist and dampness&#x201D;.

                    whereas in the <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Glenfarg</span> poems he directs the spectator from the &#x201C;grassy hills&#x201D; to the clear and &#x201C;starry&#x201D; sky

                    and from the &#x201C;icicles . . . so near&#x201D; to the &#x201C;trees . . . waving upon the rocks side&#x201D; to the &#x201C;mountains at a distance seen&#x201D;

                    As the later guidebook boasts, promoting the resort: &#x201C;Being surrounded by hills&#x201D;, the village &#x201C;has thus the double advantage of having a dry, 
                    wholesome, pure air, such as cannnot be found in low&#x2010;lying places, and of being well sheltered from violent winds, 
                    or cold inclement blasts&#x201D; (&#x003C;a href&#x003D;"/notes/bibliography#JACKGLENFARG7ED" target&#x003D;"_self"&#x003E;<span class="persName-JWJ">Jack</span>, <span class="title-book-JACKGLENFARG7ED"><i>Glenfarg and District Past and Present</i></span>&#x003C;/a&#x003E;, 7th ed. &#x005B;n.d.&#x005D;, 3).</div>
