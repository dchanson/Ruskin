                <head type="title">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth</head>
                <p>The aim of this note is not to provide an exhaustive listing of books that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> read or consulted in his youth. 
                    Information about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s reading and its influences is available throughout <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, 
                    in the apparatuses and glosses of works containing specific allusions to and borrowings from publications to which he was exposed. 
                    Especially influential authors and published sources, moreover, are discussed in notes of their own. 
                    This information can be accessed using the site&#x02bc;s Search. However, this note does attempt to provide an overview of Ruskin's reading in childhood and youth in the section,

                <p>One purpose of the present note is to centralize <ref type="internal" target="#RESOURCES">Resources</ref> for researching the Ruskin family reading during <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s youth 
                    by extending and enhancing existing research sources. Included are <ref type="internal" target="#ANNUALLISTS">Lists of Annual Book Purchases by the Ruskin Family</ref>,

                    <ref type="internal" target="#UNTRACED">Untraced Books</ref>. These resources build on the enumerative bibliographies

                    <p>As a preliminary to introducing supplements to <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>&#x02bc;s and 
                        <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName>&#x02bc;s bibliographies, some caveats merit discussion 
                        about what we are able to determine about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s reading in his youth.</p>
                    
                    <div type="subsection" xml:id="PROVENANCE">
                        <head type="subsection">Provenance</head>
                        <p>Assuming that the provenance of a copy of printed material can be traced securely to Brantwood, 
                            Ruskin's final home, its presence in his adult library is only one starting point for investigating the item's availability to him during his youth, 
                            even if the item's publication date falls within a relevant range. 
                            For example, among Ruskin's supposed boyhood <ref type="internal" target="#BEINECKEBOOKS">books held by the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke Library</orgName></ref> 
                            are two bound collections, each gathering separately published works. These were acquired by the collector, 
                            F. J. Sharp, but documentation is lacking to assign responsibility for the bindings--whether to Sharp himself 
                            or to his source--or to provide information about the provenance of the individual items. 
                            While in some of these items, marginalia recognizably in Ruskin's mature hand lends authenticity, 
                            juvenile scribblings can only be assumed to be ascribable to him in boyhood. In one case, 
                            the Beinecke holding of a title, known to have been a favorite of Ruskin's in youth, 
                            <title type="book" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title> 
                            by John Aikin and Anna Laetitia Barbauld, is authenticated by annotations in Ruskin's mature hand; 
                            however, despite the presence of a few scrawls that are possibly childish marks, the copy very likely is not his original boyhood possession. 
                            Other printed items bear no marks of provenance apart from a bookplate, which, depending on the class of Ruskin bookplate, 
                            may or may not attest to the item's provenance extending from the library at Brantwood to Ruskin's books at Herne Hill. 
                            As in any case for provenance, one can only weigh the evidence, and one purpose of 
                            <ref type="internal" target="#DESCRIPTIONS">Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Youth</ref> is to compile and examine that evidence.</p>
                        
                        <p>A huge boon for our knowledge of the Ruskin family reading during Ruskin's boyhood and youth is provided by the record of book and periodical purchases contained in 
                            <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>'s ledger of household accounts, the Account Book, 
                            which consist usually of brief author and/or title identifications along with exact costs. 
                            Van Akin Burd, in the Ruskin Family Letters, helpfully compared these entries 
                            against the items' publishing history and publisher's listings with prices; 
                            however, John James's sketchy identification of author and/or title leaves some items in doubt. 
                            Thus, while starting with Burd's transcriptions, one is always advised to revisit John James's original entries for clarity, 
                            as well as to scan the entries for possible overlooked items. 
                            In <ref type="internal" target="#ANNUALLISTS">Lists of Annual Book Purchases by the Ruskin Family</ref>, Burd's lists 
                            are expanded with possible additional items.</p>
                        
                        <p>The advisability of re-exmining manuscript and bibliographical evidence applies to any putative reading materials owned or consulted 
                            by the Ruskin family, but some caveats apply especially to Ruskin's reading in his youth. 
                            First, John James's extant Account Book begins in 1827, omitting records related to the earliest years of Ruskin's reading. 
                            This would have been the period when Ruskin's parents acquired many of the juvenile publications that are now held in Ruskin collections. 
                            The family's commerce in juvenile literature prior to 1827 surfaces occasionally in the family letters, 
                            as well as in remarks by Ruskin thoughout his later works; and some of these mentions of titles 
                            can be attached to known bibliographical details or even a surviving physical copy believed to have belonged to the Ruskins, 
                            but many of the references reveal nothing but the title. 
                            For example, when Ruskin was four years old, Margaret suggested titles to John James 
                            that would be acceptable as gifts: "if you bring any thing for him let it be 
                            <title type="story" corresp="#CHILDRENINTHEWOOD">the history of the children of the wood</title> 
                            or <title type="story" corresp="#SINBADTHESAILOR">Sinbad the Sailor</title>--since he has been ill 
                            he has had so much medicine to take that I have been obliged to buy I don't know how many books 
                            and you might perhaps bring him some he has already[.] You can bring nothing he will be so well pleased with as a book" 
                            (11 March 1823, Ruskin Family Letters, ed. Burd, 126-27). Since it is not known whether these titles were ever acquired, 
                            or, if purchased, in what edition, the titles are relegated to the list of 
                            <ref type="internal" target="#UNTRACED">Untraced Books</ref>. Nonetheless, in these instances, as in 
                            <ref type="internal" target="#BEINECKEBOOKS">Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Youth</ref>, 
                            some contextualization is provided.</p>
                        
                        <p>While Margaret's comment quoted from the 1823 letter cannot be matched with surviving copies, 
                            her remark does reveal some information about the family's book-buying habits in the early years. 
                            First, both parents were purchasers. The kinds of texts mentioned by Margaret in 1823 were available as booklets with engravings for sixpence or a shilling, 
                            a cost that Margaret's household budget presumably could accommodate. Examples of such inexpensive publications targeted at a young audience are included in the 
                            <ref type="internal" target="#BEINECKEBOOKS">two bound collections of juvenile texts with a Brantwood provenance, which are now held by the Beinecke Library</ref>. 
                            By comparison with such prices, Margaret sounds aghast in an 1826 letter over John James "spending two guineas on" John for a copy of Robinson Crusoe. 
                            For such extravagance, Margaret wondered "what he [John] can do to make return" beyond making a "cave" which he had "almost finished"--possibly 
                            a project similar to "Robinson Crusoe's island" undertaken by Maria Edgeworth's Frank and his cousin Mary, 
                            which included appropriating the housekeeper's parrot 
                            (Margaret Ruskin to John James Ruskin, 25 May 1826, Ruskin Family Letters, ed. Burd, 149; 
                            Dearden, Library of John Ruskin, 91 [no. 693]; 
                            Edgeworth, Frank: A Sequel, 1:71-72). 
                            Starting in 1827, when book purchases are listed in John James's Account Book, 
                            the purchaser is not recorded. While John James devoted a column in each year to "House Expenses &#x0026; paid Mrs R.", 
                            these expenses are comprised only of household staples, while books are always listed among the miscellaneous items headed as "Sundries" for each year.</p>
                        
                        <p>Not only are the books and other items listed under "Sundries" ascribed to no specific purchaser; 
                            the titles also are not assigned to a recipient. As another caveat, one cannot be certain that a book acquisition listed in John James's accounts was intended for <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>. 
                            Some titles may record gifts for his cousins, especially for 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_mary_note.php"><persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName> (<date notBefore="1815" notAfter="1849">1815&#x2013;49</date>)</ref>, 
                            who lived with the Ruskin family from <date when="1828">1828</date> until her marriage in <date when="1848">1848</date>. While <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName> comments about the family library that 
                            &#x201c;the books owned by all three Ruskins must be considered to be part of &#x2018;Ruskin&#x02bc;s Library&#x2019; because he ultimately inherited his parents&#x02bc; possessions, 
                            as well as having the use of them during their lifetimes&#x201d;, one wonders how far the availability, much less the inheritance, 
                            extended in the case of <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName>&#x02bc;s books. To what extent did John and Mary share books? 
                            The caveat seems especially applicable to duplicate copies, such as a purchase of Robinson Crusoe in 1835, 
                            long after the two-guinea edition gifted in 1826
                            (Ruskin Family Letters, 301 n. 12; Dearden, Library of John Ruskin, 91 [no. 694]). 
                            Alternatively, a duplicate title might refer to an additional, compact edition to be taken on travels, 
                            particularly in the case of a work like Robinson Crusoe, which was deemed permissible reading for a Sunday. 
                            <!--<persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName> is right to conclude with the caution that,

                    <p>As <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName> remarks, in adulthood <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> &#x201c;was essentially . . . a book&#x2010;buyer rather than a book borrower or library user&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, xix). This practice was inherited from his father, 
                        who was generous with purchases of books for his family&#x02bc;s education and entertainment. Still, there is no way of knowing 
                        whether publications that left their influence in the early manuscripts were borrowed or owned, 
                        if otherwise unrecorded as part of the family library in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</date>. For example, 
                        <persName corresp="#FDH">Felicia Hemans</persName> was sufficiently admired for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to have transcribed her poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#HEMANSSOUNDOFTHESEA">&#x201c;The Sound of the Sea&#x201d;</title> (<date when="1826">1826</date>) in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIVB">MS IVB</title>, 
                        probably based on the text as published in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#NEWMONTHLYMAGAZINE"><hi rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine</hi></title>. He also adapted passages from <persName corresp="#FDH">Hemans</persName>&#x02bc;s long poem,

                        Yet <persName corresp="#FDH">Mrs. Hemans</persName> is curiously absent from records of the Ruskins&#x02bc; book ownership, 
                        apart from poems included in literary annuals that the Ruskins are known to have owned. 
                        How publications by <persName corresp="#FDH">Hemans</persName> passed through their hands&#x2014;whether by purchase, borrowing, or casually encountering a periodical&#x2014;remains unknown.</p>
                    
                    <p>Borrowing could have provided a means for <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> to control what books entered the house. 
                        She appears to refer to borrowing, for example, when she writes to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> about the novel,

Since she &#x201c;did not like&#x201d; the novel, 
                        she &#x201c;got the first volume merely to read the History of the three little fishes to <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x201d;. 
                        In this instance, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02bc;s renewed encounter with the novel led to &#x201c;the Almighty open[ing] the understanding&#x201d;, 
                        and she decided to &#x201c;read it together&#x201d; with <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>. Perhaps only then was the full work acquired for the household, 
                        perhaps in the abridgement of the novel by <persName corresp="#JWESLEY">John Wesley</persName>

                    <p>On travels, the Ruskins supplemented books they brought with them by tapping resources along the way; for example,

                        one of the periodicals issued by <orgName corresp="#GALIGNANI">Librairie Galignani</orgName>, the Paris&#x2010;based English&#x2010;language publisher, bookseller, and circulating library, 
                        which published two monthly journals, the <title type="periodical" corresp="#GALIGNANIREPERTORY"><hi rend="italic">Repertory</hi></title> (ca. <date notBefore="1807" notAfter="1825">1807&#x2013;25</date>), and

                        which supplied English travelers and expatriates with contemporary British poetry and prose. 
                        The editions were issued in duodecimo, a size convenient for travel, but printed using excellent type and engravings, 
                        and edited for correct and complete text&#x2014;in some cases, text more complete and reliable than what could be found in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> editions. 
                        As piracies, the volumes were priced significantly cheaper than corresponding <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> editions, 
                        and sold in paper&#x2010;covered boards&#x2014;volumes that could be shared among travelers at a hotel and left behind for others&#x02bc; enjoyment. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did retain from boyhood one of <orgName corresp="#GALIGNANI">Galignani</orgName>&#x02bc;s outstanding volumes in the series

                        <p>Whoever was responsible for their sorting and binding, the Beinecke's two bound collections of books likely belonging to Ruskin's earliest years--the 
                            volume of didactic, moral, and relgious works, <ref type="internal" target="#WIDOW"><title type="binding_slipcase" corresp="#WIDOWOFROSENEATHCOMP">"The Widow of Roseneath etc."</title></ref> and 
                            the volume of fantasy, <ref type="internal" target="#FAIRYTALES"><title type="binding_slipcase" corresp="#FAIRYTALESSHARPCOLL">"Fairy Tales"</title></ref>--exemplify 
                            what William McCarthy characterizes as the "Manichaean . . . need to dichotomize" the "story 
                            about the way children's literature developed" and "then to extol or damn its dichotomized terms" 
                            (McCarthy, "Mother of All Discourses", 198). On one side, the collection "Fairy Tales" binds together works that Charles Lamb 
                            might have approved as akin to "old classics of the nursery". According to Lamb's well-known tirade, these 
                            "wild tales" of imagination inspired a "beautiful Interest" by making "the child a man, while all the time he suspected himself to be no bigger than a child". 
                            On the other side, didactic works approved by modern progressive educationists such as "Mrs. B[arbauld]'s &#x0026; Mrs. Trimmer's nonsense", 
                            speciously puffed up a child "with conceit of his own powers". Supposed "Science . . . [had] succeeded to Poetry" but the 
                            "Knowledge" conveyed in such works was "insignificant &#x0026; vapid". 
                            "<hi rend="italic">Damn them</hi>", Lamb anathematized. "I mean the cursed Barbauld Crew, 
                            those <hi rend="italic">Blights &#x0026; Blasts</hi> of all that is <hi rend="italic">Human</hi> in man &#x0026; child" 
                            (Lamb to S. T. Coleridge, 23 October 1802, in Letters of Charles and Mary Anne Lamb, 2:81-82).</p>
                        
                        <p>The separately bound collections preserved at the Beinecke appear to reflect this division, 
                            but the elder Ruskins left no indication of what they thought about this controversy between the Romantics and the educationists 
                            or whether they were even aware of it. Recent scholarship has shown how "Science" and "Poetry" shown how 
                            concepts of <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> and <hi rend="italic">imagination</hi> were more entangled 
                            in education and children's literature of the long eighteenth century than Lamb cared to admit; 
                            and critics have revolutionized our understanding of how women educationists such as Letitia Barbauld and Sarah Trimmer 
                            contributed an alternative sociability and sense of self to Romanticism. Moreover, where Lamb saw a uniform pedagogy in the women's "nonsense", 
                            scholars have also discerned as separate politics in Barbauld's Dissenter progressivism and Trimmer's Anglican conservatism. 
                            The Ruskins must have been able to distinguish these differences, as well, yet the evidence points to catholicity in their choices of children's literature. 
                            They shared neither the Romantics' hostility toward progressive instructional works such as the Edgeworths' practical education 
                            nor Trimmer's suspicions of imaginative works such as fairy tales, whether new or traditional.</p>
                        
                        <p>While allowing for catholicity of genres, the elder Ruskins did adhere to a program of graduated and progressive age&#x2010;appropriate reading for children that had been 
                            introduced at the end of the previous century by Mrs. Barbauld and developed by the Edgeworths. 
                            While precise dates are elusive for when John first engaged with many of the works he is known to have read in his youth, 
                            some distinct stratifications of readings can be discerned. These layers can be correlated to developments in his own writing, 
                            which reflects his reading both in content and the materiality of typography and illustration. The age-appropriate layers 
                            of reading are permeable, however, as over time Ruskin retained his affection for re-reading some works for children even into adulthood.</p>

                                    curiously juxtaposes a traditional tale of childhood vulnerability and death with a tales from the Arabian Nights presenting the magical strength and good fortune that 
                                    Lamb meant by making "the child a man, while all the time he suspected himself to be no bigger than a child". 
                                    "Sinbad" belonged among the "wild tales" preferred by the Romantic opponents to the "cursed Barbauld Crew", since, 
                                    as Janet Bottoms characterizes this taste, the Romantics tended to look backward nostalgically to their own childhoods for examples of imaginative engagement. 
                                    As Bottoms explains, traditionary tales did not "confine the reader to the social limits and moral laws of the familiar world", which was precisely the goal 
                                    of the educationists' practical instruction; rather, the old "wild" tales "developed in unpredictable ways, rewarding hero or heroine with honours and wealth; and while not foregrounding actual children, . . . 
                                    often showed [in Coleridge's description] 'excessive smallness combined with great power', exhibiting 'through the working of the imagination, the idea of power in the will'" 
                                    (Bottoms, "The Battle of the (Children's) Books", 215, 
                                    quoting Coleridge . . .; and see <ref type="internal" target="#SINBAD">Untraced Books 2</ref>)<lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    "The Children in the Wood" (or "Babes in the Wood"), while not seemingly a work that empowered the child reader, 
                                    was likewise looked back upon as a powerfully imaginative tale by Lamb and Wordsworth. As Patricia Crain remarks, 
                                    the tale is invoked by Wordsworth in the 1800 Preface to the Lyrical Ballads and by Lamb in the essay "Dream Children" 
                                    as articulating "the romantic vision of childhood", doing the work of providing "adult consciousness of childhood as a privileged time and space 
                                    that’s been lost, that’s died, and that yet remains infinitely accessible to adult memory and imagination". By means of this approach, the Romantics 
                                    depended on a tale like "Children in the Wood" to convert the "newly privileged (and newly imagined) children’s innocence' that developed in the eighteenth century

                            In the first decade of John's reading, the elder Ruskins' acquisition of books by Letitia Barbauld and Maria Edgeworth reflect their familiarity 
                            with the concept of age-appropriate texts, even though John read above the age recommended for certain texts. At the same time, 
                            his parents chose, or he appropriated, texts that were not conceived for a child audience but contained features that appealed to Ruskin's imagination--for example, 
                            Byron's Manfred and Scott's The Monastery and The Abbot.</p>
                        <p> Yet evidence shows that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> both read above his age category 
                            (and not always with comprehension) and ranged beyond the kinds of texts typically thought appropriate for children 
                    (e.g., <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="book" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></title>, which he copied verbatim in <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201c;Harry and Lucy . . .

                    <p>Explorations of what texts were constrained or controlled reading in religious middle-class British families in the nineteenth century 
                        are perhaps inevitably dependent on the genre of autobiography, since the family was both a powerfully influential institution 
                        for socializing reading practices and potentially an eccentric one (Str&#x00F6;er, "Juvenile Sunday Reading", 66, 74-75). 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s account of his boyhood Sunday reading in his autobiography <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> 
                        is both unsurprising and problematic.

He seems to set up a misleading dichotomy, however, in characterizing his weekday reading as his &#x201c;own election&#x201d;, exemplified by <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s novels and <persName corresp="#HOMER">Homer</persName>'s poems (i.e.,

                        <ref type="internal" target="#DESCRIPTIONS">Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Youth</ref>, these classics were mixed in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s juvenile library 
                        with works both secular and Sabbatarian that now seem much more ephemeral. Second, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s retrospection 
                        flattens these readings in time, suggesting that his study even of favored works was both simultaneous and compartmentalized. In fact, , 
                        his reading was also regulated by competing programs. Moreover, the books themselves and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s responses to them did not necessarily adhere to the categories assigned to them. 
                        -->Even if his reading was subject to a weekly division, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> does not appear to have been entirely free on weekdays

                        since <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s entries are sometimes ambiguous.

                        <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> often listed names of vendors as shorthand for the wares they supplied, 
                        as well as naming recipients of gifts or purchases. In many cases, it is mere speculation whether a proper name 
                        refers to purchase of a book or of some other kind of item, and these names are flagged as &#x201c;unidentified&#x201d;. 
                        Yet the occurence of some names can sometimes be aligned with other information to identify book titles and authors

                                    The responsibility for and circumstances of binding these three items as &#x201c;Fairy Tales&#x201d; are unknown. 
                                    This title on the spine applies most legitimately to the first of the items, <title type="anthology" corresp="#MOTHERBUNCHSFAIRYTALES"><hi rend="italic">Mother Bunch&#x02bc;s Fairy Tales</hi></title>, 
                                    whereas the other two items belong only marginally, each containing just one or two stories that feature a fairy or fantastical events. 
                                    Regardless of the consistency of the collection, however, an implicit rationale becomes apparent by comparing the contents of another bound collection,

                                    &#x201c;a certain trimness (primness one might almost call it) in the covers, the quality of the paper used, 
                                    the excellent type&#x2010;face, the occasional use of coloured inks for text and illustrations, 
                                    usually bistre or sanguine, occasionally green, and a few hand&#x2010;coloured illustrations&#x201d;. 
                                    In their own time, however, the books were apparently little known outside of <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>; 
                                    and even in their own country, they were not widely popular, because their prices were considered 
                                    rather dear, even at two pence or six pence per copy&#x2014;cheaper and less elegant chapbooks by this publisher

                                            As pointed out in the &#x201c;Introductory Essay&#x201d; on the copy in the <title type="archive" corresp="#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALESHOCKLIFFE">Hockliffe Archive</title>, 
                                            the tales have no connection with Christmas, despite the anthology&#x02bc;s title, which presumably was a marketing ploy. 
                                            The text, which in some copies includes a description of the Seven Wonders of the World, 
                                            was apparently based on a collection first published in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, ca. <date when="1780">1780</date>

                                            The first story in the collection opens with commentary on the neglect of religion and morality in childhood education, 
                                            but the stories in themselves do little to redress this supposed failing. The collection is miscellaneous, 
                                            some tales teaching prudent and moral conduct, some adopting an oriental flavor, and only a few entailing magic or fairies. 
                                            Two of the latter sort feature dervises (i.e., dervishes), who reward hospitality with magical riches, but retract the reward and punish 
                                            characters who overstep boundaries owing to greed or excess curiosity.<lb/><lb/>

                                    The responsibility for binding these items together is unknown. Although not stated explicitly, <persName corresp="#HGV">Helen Viljoen</persName>&#x02bc;s description in the exhibition catalogue, 
                                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#VILJOENRUSKINSBACKGROUNDS"><title type="catalogue" corresp="#VILJOENRUSKINSBACKGROUNDS"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin&#x02bc;s Backgrounds, Friendships, and Interests</hi></title></ref> suggests 
                                    that the binding was present when received from the collector, <persName corresp="#FJS">F. J. Sharp</persName> (pp. 6-7 [item 5<hi rend="italic">a</hi>]). <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> appears to believe that the binding was present even when &#x201c;given to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> by his <persName corresp="#JJR">Father</persName>&#x201c;, 
                                    but it is unlikely that such disparate items would have been bound together originally.<lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    A rationale, if not the specific occasion for the collection 
                                    can be inferred, however, if the binding of these eight items was made in concert with the binding of <ref type="internal" target="#FAIRYTALESDISCUSSION">Fairy Tales</ref>. 
                                    As compared with the latter, the items collected here share an emphasis on &#x201c;cautionary&#x201d; tales (to draw on the subtitle of <title type="book" corresp="#TURNERTHECOWSLIP"><hi rend="italic">The Cowslip</hi></title>). 
                                    Since the early nineteenth century, such Romantic writers as <persName corresp="#CLE">Charles Lamb</persName>, <persName corresp="#STC">S. T. Coleridge</persName>, and <persName corresp="#WW">William Wordsworth</persName> 
                                    had polemically argued in favor of appealing to children&#x02bc;s imagination with fairy tales as opposed to training their reason and morals 
                                    with &#x201c;instructive&#x201d; and &#x201c;cautionary&#x201d; tales and dialogues by the &#x201c;cursed <persName corresp="#ALB">Barbauld</persName> Crew&#x201d;, as <persName corresp="#CLE">Lamb</persName> anathematized this group largely of women writers. 
                                    In our time, critics have exposed the politics underpinning these divisions, but in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, 
                                    which was probably when these two collections of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s books were bound, the reputation of 
                                    <persName corresp="#ALB">Anna Letitia Barbauld</persName> had been disassociated from her politics and reduced to bland high&#x2010;mindedness&#x2014;a &#x201c;valuation&#x201d; 
                                    of this writing that suggests, as <persName corresp="#WMCCARTHY">William McCarthy</persName> complains, &#x201c;that it entirely lacked humor, irony, or wit&#x201d; 
                                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MCCARTHYBARBAULDRECEPTION"><persName corresp="#WMCCARTHY">McCarthy</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#MCCARTHYBARBAULDRECEPTION">&#x201C;&#x2018;A High&#x2010;Minded Christian Lady&#x2019;&#x201D;</title></ref>, 179; and see 
                                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CLARKEBARBAULDCREW"><persName corresp="#NCLARKE">Clarke</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#CLARKEBARBAULDCREW">&#x201C;&#x2018;The Cursed Barbauld Crew&#x2019;&#x201D;</title></ref>, 91&#x2013;93). 
                                    Such a valuation was perhaps implicitly placed on these eight items by binding them together.<lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    The reductive valuation may not have been <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s, but it seems unlikely that he could have been responsible for binding this collection 
                                    since, as noted in the following descriptions, he annotated some of the items separately, 
                                    bequeathing them to <persName corresp="#JSAR">Joan Severn</persName> and her children. One of the annotations is dated &#x201c;<date when="1889">1889</date>&#x201d;, and another &#x201c;<date notBefore="1889" notAfter="1890">1889&#x2013;1890</date>&#x201d;, 
                                    clues that the binding was ordered after <date when="1890">1890</date> by someone other than <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x2014;perhaps by <persName corresp="#JSAR">Joan Severn</persName>&#x2014;since by that time, 
                                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself would not have been in a mental state to take such an initiative.

                                            This possibility is ruled out, however, since the <persName corresp="#FJS">Sharp</persName>/<persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> copy, which is a six&#x2010;volumes&#x2010;in&#x2010;one edition, complete in itself, cannot have formed a part of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s original set.<lb/><lb/>

                                            In an analysis of the publishing history of the book, <persName corresp="#AFYFE">Aileen Fyfe</persName> explains that, <date notBefore="1792" notAfter="1823">from 1792 until 1823</date>, the text of the first edition was controlled by the first publisher, <persName corresp="#JJPUBLISHER">Joseph Johnson</persName>, 
                                            his successor <orgName corresp="#RHUNTER">Rowland Hunter</orgName>, and other publishers to whom <orgName corresp="#RHUNTER">Hunter</orgName> sold shares. In <date when="1823">1823</date>, to maintain copyright, the shareholders solicited 
                                            a corrected and slightly expanded edition from <persName corresp="#JAIKIN">John Aikin</persName>&#x02BC;s son, <persName corresp="#AAIKIN">Arthur Aikin</persName>, which was published as the thirteenth edition, apparently in six volumes; 
                                            and in <date when="1826">1826</date>, an edition rearranged by <persName corresp="#JAIKIN">John Aikin</persName>&#x02BC;s daughter, <persName corresp="#LAIKIN">Lucy Aikin</persName>, was published in four volumes. Despite these new editions descending from the original,
                                            &#x201C;from the <date notBefore="1823" notAfter="1826">mid&#x2010;1820s</date>&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#AFYFE">Fyfe</persName> notes, &#x201C;any publisher could print the original text of <title type="book" corresp="#AIKENBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title>, and a number did so&#x201D;, including

                                            The Ruskins would have entered the market for <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s initial copy of <title type="book" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title> 
                                            during the transitional period in the book&#x02BC;s publishing history, between the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1826">early&#x2010; and mid&#x2010;1820s</date>, when the Aikins were revising the text in order to extend copyright, 
                                            and when other publishers were issuing reprints of the first edition. At this point, the Ruskins would likely have acquired either the new edition of <date when="1823">1823</date>, 
                                            whose shareholder publishers included (since <date when="1815">1815</date>) <orgName corresp="#BALDWINCRADOCKANDJOY">Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy</orgName>, who also published the Ruskins&#x02BC; editions of <persName corresp="#ME">Maria Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="series" corresp="#EDGEWORTHEARLYLESSONS">&#x201C;Early Lessons&#x201D;</title> series; 
                                            or they would have purchased a first&#x2010;edition reprint available from non&#x2010;shareholder publishers. At that time, those non&#x2010;shareholder reprints 
                                            would not have included <persName corresp="#JFDOVE">Dove</persName>&#x02BC;s, since, as we have seen, evidence shows him coming late to the game. Consequently, putting aside the <persName corresp="#FJS">Sharp</persName>/<persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> <persName corresp="#JFDOVE">Dove</persName> edition&#x2014;undated, but probably after <date when="1827">1827</date>&#x2014;we 
                                            cannot determine what state of the text of <title type="book" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title> was availble to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in his boyhood six&#x2010;volume version, whether the revised edition by <persName corresp="#AAIKIN">Arthur Aikin</persName> or the original descended from the <persName corresp="#JJPUBLISHER">Johnson</persName>/<orgName corresp="#RHUNTER">Hunter</orgName> shareholders (or even as originally published by <persName corresp="#JJPUBLISHER">Johnson</persName>/<orgName corresp="#RHUNTER">Hunter</orgName>).

                                            <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. Little Jack is a foundling adopted by an old man, formerly a soldier, and now living on a "wide uncultivated moor" 
                                            where he has built a hut and grows his own vegetables (p. 3). Although poor, he is content, having "'avoided, perhaps, many faults, 
                                            and much uneasiness, which I should have incurred had I been in another situation" (p. 19). He owns "one domestic" and "friend" (pp. 4-5), a goat named Little Nan, 
                                            which he rescued as a kid. Finding the infant likewise abandoned on the moor, the old man trusts "Providence which feeds the birds of the wood 
                                            and the beasts of the field, and which has promised to bless all those that are kind and charitable" (p. 6). So it is that Nan, 
                                            having "lost her kid", willingly suckles the infant, "seem[ing] to adopt him with equal tenderness as her offspring" (pp. 7, 8). 
                                            "'Who knows'", concludes the old man, “'but Providence, which has preserved this child in so wonderful a manner, 
                                            may have destined it to something equally wonderful in its future life; and may bless me as the humble agent of its decrees'” (p. 8).<lb/><lb/>
                                            
                                            A Rousseauvian savage, Little Jack is "left to nature” to grow; and since he is “unfettered by bandages or restraints” and wears "neither shoes nor stockings, nor shirt", 
                                            “his limbs" attain "their due proportions and form” (pp. 9, 10). A lady passing in her carriage hears his story, and although she 
                                            "had seen a great deal of the world, and had read a variety of books, it had never once entered into her head that a child might grow strong and vigorous by sucking a goat, 
                                            instead of eating pap" (p. 14). She offers to take him in, but, Jack refusing, gives him money for shoes and stockings. Jack dutifully attempts to discharge the charity, 
                                            but finds the shoes so cumbersome that he uses the money to buy his "daddy" a warm coat instead.<lb/><lb/>
                                            
                                            Jack's daddy teaches him only "plain and simple morals and religion", so that, when Nan dies, 
                                            Jack is "not able to talk as finely about love, tenderness, and sensibility, as many other little boys, 
                                            that have enjoyed greater advantages of education". Nonetheless, like Harry Sandford compared to Tommy Merton, 
                                            Jack feels "the reality" of such emotions "in his heart, and thought it . . . natural to love every thing that loves us" (p. 13). 
                                            Jack has one fault, however, of being "a little too jealous of his honour", which he is able to defend with "such dispositions for the art of boxing, 
                                            that he could beat every boy in the neighbourhood, of his age and size" (pp. 16-17). 
                                            (The plate showing Jack boxing with Tom the Collier is the only cut that Ruskin did not outline on the reverse.)<lb/><lb/>
                                            
                                            When Jack is twelve, the old man dies. In his grief, Jack desperately tries to restore warmth to the corpse by stripping naked and lying atop him. 
                                            A local farmer who is acquainted with Jack takes him in and teaches him farmwork, but the farmer dies as well. Jack resolutely sets out to find other means to support himself. 
                                            Chancing on an iron foundry, he is drawn to its warmth and shelter. The industry contrasts with his agrarian upbringing, but his straigtforward account of himself leads to a position. 
                                            Because he is incautiously open about his history, however, the other boys tease him, provoking Jack to frequent fistfights.
                                            
                                            One day, the foundry is toured by gentlemen and ladies. (The foundry processes are detailed sufficiently to form a brief example of the factory tour genre.) 
                                            The visit is interrupted by the disturbance of another fight, causing the master to threaten Jack with dismissal. 
                                            The foreman interjects how Jack is a dependable workman, and Jack stoutly defends his behavior, describing how the boys mock his strange upbringing. 
                                            While the visitors also cannot restrain their laughter at the story of Nan, the company happens to include the lady who had heard the story previously and given him money for shoes. 
                                            She once again offers to take Jack into service, and he accepts.
                                            
                                            "Call him a little soldier, and Jack was at every one's disposal. This was Jack's particular foible and vanity", imitating his daddy, the old soldier, 
                                            by "poising a dung-fork, charging with a broom-stick, and standing sentry at the stable-door" (p. 31). He also developes an "immoderate love of horses" (p. 32); 
                                            and building on his experience at the foundry, learns some smithing, sadlery, and carpentry. His resourcefulnesss makes him useful and entertaining to his mistress's orphaned nephew, 
                                            young Master Willets. Allowed to be on familiar terms with the boy, Jack listens to Master Willets’s lessons, and practices writing and studying on his own at night.
                                            
                                            This happiness comes to an end when Master Willets is visited by a young gentleman "with a very great taste for finery, and a supreme contempt for all the vulgar" (p. 37). 
                                            The gentleman of course cannot abide Jack, and Jack resents the injury to his honor. Happening to acquire a monkey from a showman, Jack outfits the animal as a parody of the gentleman, 
                                            inciting the gentlemen to cruelly slay the monkey and receive a harmless indignity in return. Jack refuses to apologize, and his "obstinacy" leads to his dismissal (p. 42).
                                            
                                            Coming at last to his adoptive father's profession, Jack enlists as a marine and is sent to India. While pausing to hunt on an island, Jack is separated from his party and loses his way. 
                                            Fearing to be treated by the natives "as the white men generally treat the blacks when they get them into their possession", 
                                            Jack decides to survive on his own, content to be rid of anyone "'to quarrel with me, or baa, or laugh at my poor daddy and mammy [Nan]'" (pp. 48-49). 
                                            A brief Robinsonade ensues until Jack is rescued by an English ship, which carries him to India.
                                            
                                            Jack serves ably in India, but when his regiment marches within reach of the "Tartars", he warns the officers to avoid these warriors' calvary skills. 
                                            His warnings are ignored, resulting in the army's routing. Jack is taken among the hostages, though "he alone, accustomed to all the vicissitudes of life, retain[s] his chearfulness, and [is] 
                                            prepared to meet every reverse of fortune" (p. 56). The narrator supplies an anthropological account of the Tartars, preparing to show how Jack ingratiates himself by means of his  
                                            horsemanship. He draws on his smithing to introduce the Tartars to shoeing their horses, on his sadlery to improve the Tartars' gear, and on his regard for animals to train the Tartars' horses for docility without violence. 
                                            When the English negotiate freedom for the hostages, the Tartars present Jack with valuable presents. Returned to the English camp, he secures an honorable discharge.
                                            
                                            Back in England, Jack returns to the iron foundry as a foreman, and ends as a partner. He buys the moor where the old man found him and Nan, 
                                            and on the site of the old man's hut he builds a "small but convenient house" where "he would sometimes retire from business, and cultivate his garden with his own hands, 
                                            for he hated idleness". He now freely relates his history without fear of mockery, since “it is of very little consequence how a man comes into the world, 
                                            provided he behaves well, and discharges his duty when he is in it” (pp. 64, 65).

                                    No further indication appears in the family letters that the tale was acquired.<lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    The original ballad relates how a dying man and his wife commend their young son and daughter to the care of the man's brother. 
                                    After a year of caring for the children, the uncle succumbs to the temptation of their inheritance, 
                                    and hires assassins to convey the children to a wood and murder them. 
                                    One of the would-be killers has a change of heart and, to avert the deed, kills his partner, but then abandons the children 
                                    to die of starvation and exposure in the wood. Their bodies are covered with leaves by a robin.<lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    The ballad first appeared in print in 1595 and long held popular appeal in broadside form, 
                                    before becoming an object of antiquarian interest when included in
                                    <title type="anthology" corresp="#PERCYRELIQUES"><hi rend="italic">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</hi></title> compiled by <persName corresp="#TPERCY">Thomas Percy</persName> (1765). 
                                    Patricia Crain has traced the ballad's "life as a printed text and its migration from the ballad canon 
                                    to the children's literature canon" in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries--the 
                                    point at which Margaret Ruskin perceived the story as appropriate comfort for an ailing four year old. 
                                    As Crain explains, these "genre and format transformations" from popular broadside to a children's book 
                                    "converse[d] and coordinate[d] with shifting views and valuations of children's lives and deaths". 
                                    By 1823, the texts and illustrations designed for child readers, 
                                    which would have been available to the Ruskins, included a prose revision by a pseudonymous "Clara English", 
                                    <title type="book" corresp="#ENGLISHCHILDRENINTHEWOOD1801"><hi rend="italic">The Children in the Wood: An Instructive Tale</hi></title> (1801),
                                    published by Darton and Harvey. In this version, the children's death and avian burial are replaced by their 
                                    rescue and training for useful work in a utopian manufacturing town 
                                    (Crain, Reading Children, 44, 50-51). In another prose version, presented as a "continuation" of the story, 
                                    <title type="book" corresp="#PERFIDYDETECTED1814"><hi rend="italic">Perfidy Detected! or, The Children in the Wood Restored, by Honestas, the Hermit of the Forest</hi></title> (1814), 
                                    the children wandering in the woods fall into the arms of a kindly hermit, who has retreated to the forest to mourn the abduction of his own children. 
                                    Not only are the children providentially discovered at the hermitage by their father, who is inexplicably alive; the hermit's lost daughters are revealed and reunited with their father, as well. 
                                    At the same time, the original story was preserved in a prose version published by William Darton,
                                    <title type="book" corresp="#CHILDRENINTHEWOOD1821"><hi rend="italic">The Children in the Wood: A Tale for the Nursery</hi></title>, 
                                    featuring a frontispiece showing the children's corpses strewn with leaves and guarded by the robin.

                                    In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in Britain, the stories relating the various adventures of <title type="story" corresp="#SINBADTHESAILOR">"Sinbad the Sailor"</title> (or "Sindbad") were available 
                                    separately from editions of the <title type="story" corresp="#ARABIANNIGHTS"><hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights</hi></title>, 
                                    of which "Sinbad" forms a part. According to the "Introductory Essay" on <title type="book" corresp="#VOYAGESOFSINBAD1805"><hi rend="italic">The Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor</hi></title> held by the Hockliffe Project, 
                                    the Sinbad tales first became available to English readers in 1712 via France, where Antoine Galland was producing his translation of the Arabian Nights, Les Mille et Une Nuits (1704-17), 
                                    and the Sinbad stories continued to be issued separately throughout the eighteenth century. The Hockliffe copy is an 1805 two-volumes-in-one issue, with engravings, of 
                                    <title type="book" corresp="#VOYAGESOFSINBAD1805"><hi rend="italic">The Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor</hi></title>, which was drawn from the

                                    Between 1801 and 1818, the Tabart firm produced influential versions of fairy tales, which became standard in spite of opposition by 
                                    Sarah Trimmer. It is possible that the Tabart texts were edited by William Godwin and translated by his second wife, Mary Jane Godwin 
                                    ("Fables and Fairy Tales").<lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    If the Ruskins acquired one of these booklets, John may have been introduced to the Sinbad stories long before his exposure 
                                    to the entirety of the Arabian Nights. In John James Ruskin's extant accounts, the entire collection is first recorded as a purchase in November 1834: 
                                    "Arabian Nights 27/" (Account Book, 34v; Ruskin Family Letters, ed. Burd, 286 n. 1). No information is given about the translation or edition. 
                                    The most recent widely available English translation of the Arabian Nights was <title type="book" corresp="#LAMBARABIANNIGHTS"><hi rend="italic">The New Arabian Nights' Entertainments</hi></title>, 
                                    translated into German by Jos. von Hammer and, in turn, into English by the Reverend George Lamb. This version was published in 1826 by Colburn and Bentley, 
                                    with a second edition appearing in 1829. This price of this version, however, does not match John James's expenditure of 27s, 
                                    being consistently advertised in other Bentley publications of the period at 18s for three small octavo volumes, bound in canvas.<lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    In mature writings, Ruskin frequently alluded to the Sinbad stories, especially the story of the Valley of Diamonds, 
                                    on which he based lecture 1, "The Valley of Diamonds", in The Ethics of the Dust (1866) (Ruskin, Works, 18:209-20).

                                    in 1785 by Thomas Holcroft (1745-1809). Burd glosses Ruskin's copy as a publication of 1817--not on the basis,
