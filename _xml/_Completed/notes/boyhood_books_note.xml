                <head type="title">Books Used by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in His Youth</head>
                <p>The aim of this note is not to provide an exhaustive listing of books that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> read or consulted in his youth. 
                    Information about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s reading and its influences is available throughout <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, 
                    in the apparatuses and glosses of works containing specific allusions to and borrowings from publications to which he was exposed. 
                    Especially influential authors and published sources, moreover, are discussed in notes of their own. 
                    This information can be accessed using the site&#x02bc;s Search. However, this note does attempt to provide an overview of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s reading in childhood and youth in the section, 
                    <ref type="internal" target="#APPROPRIATE_READING">What Counted as Appropriate Reading and When</ref>.</p>
                
                <p>One purpose of the present note is to centralize <ref type="internal" target="#RESOURCES">Resources</ref> for researching the Ruskin family reading during <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s youth 
                    by extending and enhancing existing research sources. Included are <ref type="internal" target="#ANNUALLISTS">Lists of Annual Book Purchases by the Ruskin Family</ref>, 
                    <ref type="internal" target="#DESCRIPTIONS">Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Youth</ref>, and 
                    <ref type="internal" target="#UNTRACED">Untraced Books</ref>. These resources build on the enumerative bibliographies 
                    compiled by <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName> in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">The Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref> 
                    (i.e., lists of annual book purchases drawn from <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book, RF MS 28, <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1845">1827&#x2013;45</date></title></ref>)

                    These published sources remain a starting point for all investigations of the Ruskin family reading, 
                    while the lists in this note remain open to expansion and revision.</p>

                    <head type="section">On the Evidence of Ruskin&#x02bc;s Reading in His Youth</head>
                    <p>As a preliminary to introducing supplements to <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>&#x02bc;s and 
                        <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName>&#x02bc;s bibliographies, some caveats merit discussion 
                        about what we are able to determine about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s reading in his youth.</p>
                    
                    <div type="subsection" xml:id="PROVENANCE">
                        <head type="subsection">Provenance</head>
                        <p>Assuming that the provenance of a copy of printed material can be traced securely to <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName>, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s final home, its presence in his adult library is only one starting point for investigating the item&#x02BC;s availability to him during his youth, 
                            even if the item&#x02BC;s publication date falls within a relevant range. 
                            For example, among <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s supposed boyhood <ref type="internal" target="#BEINECKEBOOKS">books held by the <placeName type="building" corresp="#BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke Library</placeName></ref> 
                            are two bound collections, each gathering separately published works. These were acquired by the collector, 
                            <persName corresp="#FJS">F. J. Sharp</persName>, but documentation is lacking to assign responsibility for the bindings&#x2014;whether to <persName corresp="#FJS">Sharp</persName> himself 
                            or to his source&#x2014;or to provide information about the provenance of the individual items. 
                            While in some of these items, marginalia recognizably in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s mature hand lends authenticity, 
                            juvenile scribblings can only be assumed to be ascribable to him in boyhood. In one case, 
                            the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke</orgName> holding of a title, known to have been a favorite of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s in youth, 
                            <title type="book" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title> 
                            by <persName corresp="#JAIKIN">John Aikin</persName> and <persName corresp="#ALB">Anna Laetitia Barbauld</persName>, is authenticated by annotations in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s mature hand; 
                            however, despite the presence of a few scrawls that are possibly childish marks, the copy very likely is not his original boyhood possession. 
                            Other printed items bear no marks of provenance apart from a bookplate, which, depending on the class of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> bookplate, 
                            may or may not attest to the item&#x02BC;s provenance extending from the library at <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName> to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s books at <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName>. 
                            As in any case for provenance, one can only weigh the evidence, and one purpose of 
                            <ref type="internal" target="#DESCRIPTIONS">Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Youth</ref> is to compile and examine that evidence.</p>
                        
                        <p>A huge boon for our knowledge of the Ruskin family reading during <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s boyhood and youth is provided by the record of book and periodical purchases contained in 
                            <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s ledger of household accounts, the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title>, 
                            which consist usually of brief author and/or title identifications along with exact costs. 
                            <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName>, in the <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title>, helpfully compared these entries 
                            against the items&#x02BC; publishing history and publisher&#x02BC;s listings with prices; 
                            however, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s sketchy identification of author and/or title leaves some items in doubt. 
                            Thus, while starting with <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>&#x02BC;s transcriptions, one is always advised to revisit <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s original entries for clarity, 
                            as well as to scan the entries for possible overlooked items. 
                            In <ref type="internal" target="#ANNUALLISTS">Lists of Annual Book Purchases by the Ruskin Family</ref>, <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>&#x02BC;s lists 
                            are expanded with possible additional items.</p>
                        
                        <p>The advisability of re&#x2010;exmining manuscript and bibliographical evidence applies to any putative reading materials owned or consulted 
                            by the Ruskin family, but some caveats apply especially to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s reading in his youth. 
                            First, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s extant <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title> begins in <date when="1827">1827</date>, omitting records related to the earliest years of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s reading. 
                            This would have been the period when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s parents acquired many of the juvenile publications that are now held in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collections. 
                            The family&#x02BC;s commerce in juvenile literature prior to <date when="1827">1827</date> surfaces occasionally in the family letters, 
                            as well as in remarks by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> thoughout his later works; and some of these mentions of titles 
                            can be attached to known bibliographical details or even a surviving physical copy believed to have belonged to the Ruskins, 
                            but many of the references reveal nothing but the title. 
                            For example, when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was four years old, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> suggested titles to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> 
                            that would be acceptable as gifts: &#x201C;if you bring any thing for him let it be 
                            <title type="story" corresp="#CHILDRENINTHEWOOD">the history of the children of the wood</title> 
                            or <title type="story" corresp="#SINBADTHESAILOR">Sinbad the Sailor</title>&#x2014;since he has been ill 
                            he has had so much medicine to take that I have been obliged to buy I don&#x02BC;t know how many books 
                            and you might perhaps bring him some he has already[.] You can bring nothing he will be so well pleased with as a book&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="letter" corresp="#mr_to_jjr_1823-03-11"><date when="1823-03-11">11 March 1823</date></title>, <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title>, ed. <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName></ref>, 126&#x2013;27). Since it is not known whether these titles were ever acquired, 
                            or, if purchased, in what edition, the titles are relegated to the list of 
                            <ref type="internal" target="#UNTRACED">Untraced Books</ref>. Nonetheless, in these instances, as in 
                            <ref type="internal" target="#BEINECKEBOOKS">Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Youth</ref>, 
                            some contextualization is provided.</p>
                        
                        <p>While <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s comment quoted from the <date when="1823">1823</date> letter cannot be matched with surviving copies, 
                            her remark does reveal some information about the family&#x02BC;s book&#x2010;buying habits in the early years. 
                            First, both parents were purchasers. The kinds of texts mentioned by <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> in <date when="1823">1823</date> were available as booklets with engravings for sixpence or a shilling, 
                            a cost that <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s household budget presumably could accommodate. Examples of such inexpensive publications targeted at a young audience are included in the 
                            <ref type="internal" target="#BEINECKEBOOKS">two bound collections of juvenile texts with a <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName> provenance, which are now held by the <placeName type="building" corresp="#BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke Library</placeName></ref>.

                    <p>As <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName> remarks, in adulthood <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> &#x201c;was essentially . . . a book&#x2010;buyer rather than a book borrower or library user&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, xix). This practice was inherited from his father, 
                        who was generous with purchases of books for his family&#x02bc;s education and entertainment. Still, there is no way of knowing 
                        whether publications that left their influence in the early manuscripts were borrowed or owned, 
                        if otherwise unrecorded as part of the family library in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</date>. For example, 
                        <persName corresp="#FDH">Felicia Hemans</persName> was sufficiently admired for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to have transcribed her poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#HEMANSSOUNDOFTHESEA">&#x201c;The Sound of the Sea&#x201d;</title> (<date when="1826">1826</date>) in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIVB">MS IVB</title>, 
                        probably based on the text as published in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#NEWMONTHLYMAGAZINE"><hi rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine</hi></title>. He also adapted passages from <persName corresp="#FDH">Hemans</persName>&#x02bc;s long poem, 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#HEMANSRESTORATIONWORKSOFART"><hi rend="italic">The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy</hi></title>, published by <orgName corresp="#MURRAY">Murray</orgName> in <date when="1816">1816</date>, for use in his own poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201c;Saltzburg&#x201d;</title>. 
                        Yet <persName corresp="#FDH">Mrs. Hemans</persName> is curiously absent from records of the Ruskins&#x02bc; book ownership, 
                        apart from poems included in literary annuals that the Ruskins are known to have owned. 
                        How publications by <persName corresp="#FDH">Hemans</persName> passed through their hands&#x2014;whether by purchase, borrowing, or casually encountering a periodical&#x2014;remains unknown.</p>
                    
                    <p>Borrowing could have provided a means for <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> to control what books entered the house. 
                        She appears to refer to borrowing, for example, when she writes to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> about the novel, 
                        <title type="book" corresp="#BROOKEFOOLOFQUALITY"><hi rend="italic">The Fool of Quality</hi></title> (<date notBefore="1766" notAfter="1772">1766&#x2013;72</date>) by <persName corresp="#HBROOKE">Henry Brooke</persName> (<date notBefore="1703" notAfter="1783">1703&#x2013;83</date>). Since she &#x201c;did not like&#x201d; the novel, 
                        she &#x201c;got the first volume merely to read the History of the three little fishes to <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x201d;. 
                        In this instance, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02bc;s renewed encounter with the novel led to &#x201c;the Almighty open[ing] the understanding&#x201d;, 
                        and she decided to &#x201c;read it together&#x201d; with <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>. Perhaps only then was the full work acquired for the household, 
                        perhaps in the abridgement of the novel by <persName corresp="#JWESLEY">John Wesley</persName>

                    <p>On travels, the Ruskins supplemented books they brought with them by tapping resources along the way; for example,

                        one of the periodicals issued by <orgName corresp="#GALIGNANI">Librairie Galignani</orgName>, the Paris&#x2010;based English&#x2010;language publisher, bookseller, and circulating library,

                        which supplied English travelers and expatriates with contemporary British poetry and prose. 
                        The editions were issued in duodecimo, a size convenient for travel, but printed using excellent type and engravings, 
                        and edited for correct and complete text&#x2014;in some cases, text more complete and reliable than what could be found in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> editions. 
                        As piracies, the volumes were priced significantly cheaper than corresponding <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> editions, 
                        and sold in paper&#x2010;covered boards&#x2014;volumes that could be shared among travelers at a hotel and left behind for others&#x02bc; enjoyment. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did retain from boyhood one of <orgName corresp="#GALIGNANI">Galignani</orgName>&#x02bc;s outstanding volumes in the series

                            contributed an alternative sociability and sense of self to Romanticism. Moreover, where <persName corresp="#CLE">Lamb</persName> saw a uniform pedagogy in the women&#x02BC;s &#x201C;nonsense&#x201D;, 
                            scholars have also discerned as separate politics in <persName corresp="#ALB">Barbauld</persName>&#x02BC;s Dissenter progressivism and <persName corresp="#STRIMMER">Trimmer</persName>&#x02BC;s Anglican conservatism. 
                            The Ruskins must have been able to distinguish these differences, as well, yet the evidence points to catholicity in their choices of children&#x02BC;s literature. 
                            They shared neither the Romantics&#x02BC; hostility toward progressive instructional works such as the Edgeworths&#x02BC; practical education 
                            nor <persName corresp="#STRIMMER">Trimmer</persName>&#x02BC;s suspicions of imaginative works such as fairy tales, whether new or traditional.</p>
                        
                        <p>While allowing for catholicity of genres, the elder Ruskins did adhere to a program of graduated and progressive age&#x2010;appropriate reading for children that had been 
                            introduced at the end of the previous century by <persName corresp="#ALB">Mrs. Barbauld</persName> and developed by the Edgeworths. 
                            While precise dates are elusive for when <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> first engaged with many of the works he is known to have read in his youth, 
                            some distinct stratifications of readings can be discerned. These layers can be correlated to developments in his own writing, 
                            which reflects his reading both in content and the materiality of typography and illustration. The age&#x2010;appropriate layers 
                            of reading are permeable, however, as over time <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> retained his affection for re&#x2010;reading some works for children even into adulthood. 
                            The periods of age&#x2010;appropriate reading into which the following chronology is divided are therefore approximate but not arbitrary, 
                            being based both on available documentation about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s books and on his response to books in his writing.

                        flattens these readings in time, suggesting that his study even of favored works was both simultaneous and compartmentalized. In fact, ,

                                    As <persName corresp="#JBOTTOMS">Janet Bottoms</persName> defines this taste, Romantics like <persName corresp="#CLE">Lamb</persName> and <persName corresp="#STC">Coleridge</persName> tended to look backward nostalgically to their own childhoods for examples of imaginative engagement. 
                                    For them, traditional tales escaped the confines of &#x201C;the social limits and moral laws of the familiar world&#x201D;&#x2014;the boundaries within which the educationists 
                                    aimed to socialize the child subject. The old &#x201C;wild&#x201D; tales, rather, &#x201C;developed in unpredictable ways, rewarding hero or heroine with honours and wealth&#x201D;; and instead of &#x201C;foregrounding actual children&#x201D; as subjects, 
                                    encouraged identification with (in <persName corresp="#STC">Coleridge</persName>&#x02BC;s description) &#x201C;excessive smallness combined with great power&#x201D;, thus &#x201C;exhibiting, through the working of the imagination, the idea of power in the will&#x201D;. 
                                    Such tales as the <title type="story" corresp="#ARABIANNIGHTS">Arabian Nights</title>, <persName corresp="#STC">Coleridge</persName> emphasizes, &#x201C;cause no deep feeling of a moral kind&#x2014;whether of religion or love; but an impulse of motion is communicated to the mind without excitement, 
                                    and this is the reason of their being so generally read and admired&#x201D;

                        <p>Finally, questions of the provenance of publications for children in the Ruskin library are preliminary to the more complex question of what counted for the Ruskins as <hi rend="italic">children&#x02BC;s literature</hi>. 
                            In the first decade of <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s reading, the elder Ruskins&#x02BC; acquisition of books by <persName corresp="#ALB">Letitia Barbauld</persName> and <persName corresp="#ME">Maria Edgeworth</persName> reflect their familiarity 
                            with the concept of age&#x2010;appropriate texts, even though <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> read above the age recommended for certain texts. At the same time, 
                            his parents chose, or he appropriated, texts that were not conceived for a child audience but contained features that appealed to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s imagination&#x2014;for example, 
                            <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#BYRONMANFRED"><hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi></title> and <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY"><hi rend="italic">The Monastery</hi></title> and <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTABBOT"><hi rend="italic">The Abbot</hi></title>.</p>
                        <p> Yet evidence shows that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> both read above his age category 
                            (and not always with comprehension) and ranged beyond the kinds of texts typically thought appropriate for children 
                            (e.g., <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="book" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></title>, which he copied verbatim in <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201c;Harry and Lucy . . .

                    <p>In <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">The Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName> transcribes <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s brief notations of authors and/or titles that he 
                        purchased each month of every year, from <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1845">1827 through 1845</date>, in his <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref>. In the ledger, 
                        book purchases are included among many other miscellaneous items on the pages devoted to &#x201c;Sundries&#x201d; for each year. 
                        Because <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> notes the amounts spent, <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> is able in many cases to identify the authors/titles 
                        with specific editions available at the time from publishers at those prices. <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>&#x02bc;s transcriptions and annotations are very reliable, 
                        but should nonetheless be revisited and compared against the manuscript of the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref>, 
                        since <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s entries are sometimes ambiguous. Where appropriate, original entries in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref> are referenced throughout <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>. 
                        Here, for convenience of reference, are listed the page numbers in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref> of <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>&#x02bc;s transcribed lists, 
                        along with the corresponding pages of &#x201c;Sundries&#x201d; in the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref>. Here also are expansions and suggested corrections of <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>&#x02bc;s lists.</p>
                        
                    <p><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> omitted one year of sundry book purchases, those for <date when="1830">1830</date>, from <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 
                        presumably because no letters are extant from that year, thus giving no occasion for annotation. 
                        <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName> has incorporated the <date when="1830">1830</date> purchases into the alphabetized entries in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">The Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>; however, 
                        since <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s book lists organized chronologically by year form a helpful comparison 
                        with the discussions of dating works and manuscripts in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, the <date when="1830">1830</date> book list is compiled in its entirety, 
                        cross&#x2010;referenced with entries in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">The Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>. This list and others from <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1845">1827&#x2013;45</date> will be updated 
                        as new information comes to light. More speculatively, annual lists are also compiled 
                        for years prior to the start of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref> in <date when="1827">1827</date>. These identifications are ongoing.</p>
                    
                    <p>Some names are transcribed from <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s &#x201c;Sundries&#x201d; that may or may not refer to books or authors. 
                        <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> often listed names of vendors as shorthand for the wares they supplied, 
                        as well as naming recipients of gifts or purchases. In many cases, it is mere speculation whether a proper name 
                        refers to purchase of a book or of some other kind of item, and these names are flagged as &#x201c;unidentified&#x201d;. 
                        Yet the occurence of some names can sometimes be aligned with other information to identify book titles and authors 
                        at least tentatively. Again, these identifications are ongoing.</p>

                                    Now highly regarded among collectors, <orgName corresp="#LUMSDENANDSON">Lumsden</orgName>&#x02bc;s children&#x02bc;s books are distinguished by 
                                    &#x201c;a certain trimness (primness one might almost call it) in the covers, the quality of the paper used, 
                                    the excellent type&#x2010;face, the occasional use of coloured inks for text and illustrations, 
                                    usually bistre or sanguine, occasionally green, and a few hand&#x2010;coloured illustrations&#x201d;. 
                                    In their own time, however, the books were apparently little known outside of <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>; 
                                    and even in their own country, they were not widely popular, because their prices were considered 
                                    rather dear, even at two pence or six pence per copy&#x2014;cheaper and less elegant chapbooks by this publisher

                                            As pointed out in the &#x201c;Introductory Essay&#x201d; on the copy in the <title type="archive" corresp="#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALESHOCKLIFFE">Hockliffe Archive</title>, 
                                            the tales have no connection with Christmas, despite the anthology&#x02bc;s title, which presumably was a marketing ploy. 
                                            The text, which in some copies includes a description of the Seven Wonders of the World, 
                                            was apparently based on a collection first published in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, ca. <date when="1780">1780</date>

                                            The first story in the collection opens with commentary on the neglect of religion and morality in childhood education, 
                                            but the stories in themselves do little to redress this supposed failing. The collection is miscellaneous, 
                                            some tales teaching prudent and moral conduct, some adopting an oriental flavor, and only a few entailing magic or fairies. 
                                            Two of the latter sort feature dervises (i.e., dervishes), who reward hospitality with magical riches, but retract the reward and punish 
                                            characters who overstep boundaries owing to greed or excess curiosity.<lb/><lb/>

                                    respectively 14 [no. 77], 12 [no. 67], 13 [no, 70], 13 [no. 69], 227 [no. 1775], 345 [no. 2736], 315 [no 2475], 23 [no. 151]. 
                                    The responsibility for binding these items together is unknown. Although not stated explicitly, <persName corresp="#HGV">Helen Viljoen</persName>&#x02bc;s description in the exhibition catalogue, 
                                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#VILJOENRUSKINSBACKGROUNDS"><title type="catalogue" corresp="#VILJOENRUSKINSBACKGROUNDS"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin&#x02bc;s Backgrounds, Friendships, and Interests</hi></title></ref> suggests 
                                    that the binding was present when received from the collector, <persName corresp="#FJS">F. J. Sharp</persName> (pp. 6&#x2013;7 [item 5<hi rend="italic">a</hi>]). <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> appears to believe that the binding was present even when &#x201c;given to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> by his <persName corresp="#JJR">Father</persName>&#x201c;, 
                                    but it is unlikely that such disparate items would have been bound together originally.<lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    A rationale, if not the specific occasion for the collection 
                                    can be inferred, however, if the binding of these eight items was made in concert with the binding of <ref type="internal" target="#FAIRYTALESDISCUSSION">Fairy Tales</ref>. 
                                    As compared with the latter, the items collected here share an emphasis on &#x201c;cautionary&#x201d; tales (to draw on the subtitle of <title type="book" corresp="#TURNERTHECOWSLIP"><hi rend="italic">The Cowslip</hi></title>). 
                                    Since the early nineteenth century, such Romantic writers as <persName corresp="#CLE">Charles Lamb</persName>, <persName corresp="#STC">S. T. Coleridge</persName>, and <persName corresp="#WW">William Wordsworth</persName> 
                                    had polemically argued in favor of appealing to children&#x02bc;s imagination with fairy tales as opposed to training their reason and morals 
                                    with &#x201c;instructive&#x201d; and &#x201c;cautionary&#x201d; tales and dialogues by the &#x201c;cursed <persName corresp="#ALB">Barbauld</persName> Crew&#x201d;, as <persName corresp="#CLE">Lamb</persName> anathematized this group largely of women writers. 
                                    In our time, critics have exposed the politics underpinning these divisions, but in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, 
                                    which was probably when these two collections of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s books were bound, the reputation of 
                                    <persName corresp="#ALB">Anna Letitia Barbauld</persName> had been disassociated from her politics and reduced to bland high&#x2010;mindedness&#x2014;a &#x201c;valuation&#x201d; 
                                    of this writing that suggests, as <persName corresp="#WMCCARTHY">William McCarthy</persName> complains, &#x201c;that it entirely lacked humor, irony, or wit&#x201d; 
                                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MCCARTHYBARBAULDRECEPTION"><persName corresp="#WMCCARTHY">McCarthy</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#MCCARTHYBARBAULDRECEPTION">&#x201C;&#x2018;A High&#x2010;Minded Christian Lady&#x2019;&#x201D;</title></ref>, 179; and see 
                                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CLARKEBARBAULDCREW"><persName corresp="#NCLARKE">Clarke</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#CLARKEBARBAULDCREW">&#x201C;&#x2018;The Cursed Barbauld Crew&#x2019;&#x201D;</title></ref>, 91&#x2013;93). 
                                    Such a valuation was perhaps implicitly placed on these eight items by binding them together.<lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    The reductive valuation may not have been <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s, but it seems unlikely that he could have been responsible for binding this collection 
                                    since, as noted in the following descriptions, he annotated some of the items separately, 
                                    bequeathing them to <persName corresp="#JSAR">Joan Severn</persName> and her children. One of the annotations is dated &#x201c;<date when="1889">1889</date>&#x201d;, and another &#x201c;<date notBefore="1889" notAfter="1890">1889&#x2013;1890</date>&#x201d;, 
                                    clues that the binding was ordered after <date when="1890">1890</date> by someone other than <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x2014;perhaps by <persName corresp="#JSAR">Joan Severn</persName>&#x2014;since by that time, 
                                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself would not have been in a mental state to take such an initiative.

                                            The tale relates the fate of a Scottish widow who, reduced in circumstances by the death of her husband,

                                    English collections of <persName corresp="#AESOP">Aesop</persName>&#x02BC;s fables did appeal across age groups and were accessible across class boundaries.

                                    both translators presented their fables as appropriate reading also for children, just as <persName corresp="#JLOCKE">John Locke</persName> (<date notBefore="1632" notAfter="1704">1632&#x2013;1704</date>) 
                                    considered &#x201C;<persName corresp="#AESOP">Aesop</persName>&#x02BC;s Fables . . . the best . . . Stories apt to delight and entertain a Child&#x201D;, while the stories &#x201C;may yet

                                    like <persName corresp="#RLESTRANGE">L&#x02BC;Estrange</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#SCROXALL">Croxall</persName>&#x02BC;s declined in favor of versions deemed appropriate to child readers,

                                            The remaining volumes sent for binding would have been the original volumes 1, 2, and 5, with volumes 3, 4, and 6 gone missing,

                                            In an analysis of the publishing history of the book, <persName corresp="#AFYFE">Aileen Fyfe</persName> explains that, <date notBefore="1792" notAfter="1823">from 1792 until 1823</date>, the text of the first edition was controlled by the first publisher, <persName corresp="#JJPUBLISHER">Joseph Johnson</persName>, 
                                            his successor <orgName corresp="#RHUNTER">Rowland Hunter</orgName>, and other publishers to whom <orgName corresp="#RHUNTER">Hunter</orgName> sold shares. In <date when="1823">1823</date>, to maintain copyright, the shareholders solicited 
                                            a corrected and slightly expanded edition from <persName corresp="#JAIKIN">John Aikin</persName>&#x02BC;s son, <persName corresp="#AAIKIN">Arthur Aikin</persName>, which was published as the thirteenth edition, apparently in six volumes; 
                                            and in <date when="1826">1826</date>, an edition rearranged by <persName corresp="#JAIKIN">John Aikin</persName>&#x02BC;s daughter, <persName corresp="#LAIKIN">Lucy Aikin</persName>, was published in four volumes. Despite these new editions descending from the original,
                                            &#x201C;from the <date notBefore="1823" notAfter="1826">mid&#x2010;1820s</date>&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#AFYFE">Fyfe</persName> notes, &#x201C;any publisher could print the original text of <title type="book" corresp="#AIKENBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title>, and a number did so&#x201D;, including 
                                            provincial and Scottish publishers (<persName corresp="#AFYFE">Fyfe</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#FYFECOPYRIGHTS">&#x201C;Copyrights and Competition&#x201D;</title>, 40).

                                            he already lagged behind some other publishers.<lb/><lb/>
                                            
                                            The Ruskins would have entered the market for <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s initial copy of <title type="book" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title> 
                                            during the transitional period in the book&#x02BC;s publishing history, between the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1826">early&#x2010; and mid&#x2010;1820s</date>, when the Aikins were revising the text in order to extend copyright, 
                                            and when other publishers were issuing reprints of the first edition. At this point, the Ruskins would likely have acquired either the new edition of <date when="1823">1823</date>, 
                                            whose shareholder publishers included (since <date when="1815">1815</date>) <orgName corresp="#BALDWINCRADOCKANDJOY">Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy</orgName>, who also published the Ruskins&#x02BC; editions of <persName corresp="#ME">Maria Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="series" corresp="#EDGEWORTHEARLYLESSONS">&#x201C;Early Lessons&#x201D;</title> series; 
                                            or they would have purchased a first&#x2010;edition reprint available from non&#x2010;shareholder publishers. At that time, those non&#x2010;shareholder reprints 
                                            would not have included <persName corresp="#JFDOVE">Dove</persName>&#x02BC;s, since, as we have seen, evidence shows him coming late to the game. Consequently, putting aside the <persName corresp="#FJS">Sharp</persName>/<persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> <persName corresp="#JFDOVE">Dove</persName> edition&#x2014;undated, but probably after <date when="1827">1827</date>&#x2014;we 
                                            cannot determine what state of the text of <title type="book" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title> was availble to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in his boyhood six&#x2010;volume version, whether the revised edition by <persName corresp="#AAIKIN">Arthur Aikin</persName> or the original descended from the <persName corresp="#JJPUBLISHER">Johnson</persName>/<orgName corresp="#RHUNTER">Hunter</orgName> shareholders (or even as originally published by <persName corresp="#JJPUBLISHER">Johnson</persName>/<orgName corresp="#RHUNTER">Hunter</orgName>). 
                                            A good bet may be the revised text of <date when="1823">1823</date>, since the shareholders carrying that text, including <orgName corresp="#BALDWINCRADOCKANDJOY">Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy</orgName>, produced substantial print runs that sold well 
                                                (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FYFECOPYRIGHTS"><persName corresp="#AFYFE">Fyfe</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#FYFECOPYRIGHTS">&#x201C;Copyrights and Competition&#x201D;</title></ref>, 43); and the Ruskins were familiar with <orgName corresp="#BALDWINCRADOCKANDJOY">Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy</orgName> 
                                                from their purchase of <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#EDGEWORTHFRANK"><hi rend="italic">Frank</hi></title> and <title type="book" corresp="#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><hi rend="italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</hi></title>. 
                                                Definitive evidence, however, must await recovery of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s three stray volumes, as rebound by <orgName corresp="#SIMPSONANDCO">Simpson</orgName>.<lb/><lb/>
                                            
                                            As for the <persName corresp="#FJS">Sharp</persName>/<persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> copy, given that it contains annotations by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> from later years, a plausible explanation may be that he acquired this <persName corresp="#JFDOVE">Dove</persName> edition at some point to replace the missing volumes of his boyhood set, 
                                            at or before the time of sending the surviving copies for rebinding; or, if the <persName corresp="#JFDOVE">Dove</persName> reprint was a more youthful acquisition, it should be treated as an additional household copy, circa <date when="1830">1830</date>. 
                                            While the front endpaper contains illegible scrawls, one of which <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> was tempted to make out to be the letter <hi rend="italic">J</hi> and interpret as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s earliest signature, 
                                            all the legible marginalia is in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s mature hand. 
                                            The back endpaper has the note: &#x201c;p 315. Earth &#x0026; Stones &#x2014; 331&#x201d;, referring to

                    and mature hands. The first volume has an inscription, &#x201C;John
                    Ruskin,&#x201D; on the first flyleaf (recto), which Viljoen identifies as
                    the hand of John James Ruskin; then, on a blank page which follows [i.e., the

                    pencilled one Ruskin apparently copied, in a most childish scrawl, from the name

                                            The caption refers to a <orgName corresp="#BRITISHPOSTOFFICE">British Post Office</orgName> packet, the <name type="vessel" corresp="#LADYHOBART">Lady Hobart</name>, 
                                            which was wrecked in <date when="1803-06">June 1803</date> after scoring a heroic success early in the war with <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>. 
                                            While sailing from <placeName corresp="#HALIFAX">Halifax</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#FALMOUTH">Falmouth</placeName>, the <name type="vessel" corresp="#LADYHOBART">Lady Hobart</name> was pursued by a French schooner. Firing on the schooner, 
                                            the British boarded the ship and captured its crew, which were soon thereafter transferred as prisoners of war to two English schooners nearby. 
                                            British naval officers took possession of the French ship, and the <name type="vessel" corresp="#LADYHOBART">Lady Hobart</name> continued on its way, carrying the French captain and his nephew. 
                                            On <date when="1803-06-28">June 28</date>, on a foggy night, the ship collided with a huge iceberg and rapidly sank. Twenty&#x2010;nine surviors filled two small boats carried by the packet, 
                                            including the captain, <persName corresp="#WDF">William Dorset Fellowes</persName> (<date notBefore="1769" notAfter="1852">1769&#x2013;1852</date>), the French captain, three women (one of them <persName corresp="#WDF">Fellowes</persName>&#x02BC;s spouse), and seamen. 
                                            The boats carried few provisions, and for seven days the castaways suffered from exposure, hunger, and thirst, 
                                            causing the French commander in a delirium to throw himself into the sea and drown. Nearing the Canadian coast, the boats were rescued on <date when="1803-07-04">4 July</date>. 
                                            <persName corresp="#WDF">Fellowes</persName> published an account of the ordeal, <title type="book" corresp="#FELLOWESNARRATIVE"><hi rend="italic">A Narrative of the Loss of His Majesty&#x02BC;s Packet, the Lady Hobart</hi></title>.

                                            where he has built a hut and grows his own vegetables (p. 3). Although poor, he is content, having &#x201C;&#x2018;avoided, perhaps, many faults,

                                            (The plate showing <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> boxing with <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMCOLLIERTD">Tom the Collier</persName> is the only cut that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did not outline on the reverse.)<lb/><lb/>
                                            
                                            When <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> is twelve, the old man dies. In his grief, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> desperately tries to restore warmth to the corpse by stripping naked and lying atop him. 
                                            A local farmer who is acquainted with <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> takes him in and teaches him farmwork, but the farmer dies as well. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> resolutely sets out to find other means to support himself. 
                                            Chancing on an iron foundry, he is drawn to its warmth and shelter. The industry contrasts with his agrarian upbringing, but his straigtforward account of himself leads to a position. 
                                            Because he is incautiously open about his history, however, the other boys tease him, provoking <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> to frequent fistfights.
                                            
                                            One day, the foundry is toured by gentlemen and ladies. (The foundry processes are detailed sufficiently to form a brief example of the factory tour genre.) 
                                            The visit is interrupted by the disturbance of another fight, causing the master to threaten <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> with dismissal. 
                                            The foreman interjects how <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> is a dependable workman, and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> stoutly defends his behavior, describing how the boys mock his strange upbringing. 
                                            While the visitors also cannot restrain their laughter at the story of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLENAN">Nan</persName>, the company happens to include the lady who had heard the story previously and given him money for shoes. 
                                            She once again offers to take <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> into service, and he accepts.
                                            
                                            &#x201C;Call him a little soldier, and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> was at every one&#x02BC;s disposal. This was <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName>&#x02BC;s particular foible and vanity&#x201D;, imitating his daddy, the old soldier, 
                                            by &#x201C;poising a dung&#x2010;fork, charging with a broom&#x2010;stick, and standing sentry at the stable&#x2010;door&#x201D; (p. 31). He also developes an &#x201C;immoderate love of horses&#x201D; (p. 32); 
                                            and building on his experience at the foundry, learns some smithing, sadlery, and carpentry. His resourcefulnesss makes him useful and entertaining to his mistress&#x02BC;s orphaned nephew, 
                                            young <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WILLETSTD">Master Willets</persName>. Allowed to be on familiar terms with the boy, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> listens to <persName corresp="#WILLETSTD">Master Willets</persName>&#x02BC;s lessons, and practices writing and studying on his own at night.
                                            
                                            This happiness comes to an end when <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WILLETSTD">Master Willets</persName> is visited by a young gentleman &#x201C;with a very great taste for finery, and a supreme contempt for all the vulgar&#x201D; (p. 37). 
                                            The gentleman of course cannot abide <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName>, and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> resents the injury to his honor. Happening to acquire a monkey from a showman, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> outfits the animal as a parody of the gentleman, 
                                            inciting the gentlemen to cruelly slay the monkey and receive a harmless indignity in return. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> refuses to apologize, and his &#x201C;obstinacy&#x201D; leads to his dismissal (p. 42).
                                            
                                            Coming at last to his adoptive father&#x02BC;s profession, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> enlists as a marine and is sent to <placeName corresp="#INDIA">India</placeName>. While pausing to hunt on an island, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> is separated from his party and loses his way. 
                                            Fearing to be treated by the natives &#x201C;as the white men generally treat the blacks when they get them into their possession&#x201D;, 
                                            <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> decides to survive on his own, content to be rid of anyone &#x201C;&#x2018;to quarrel with me, or baa, or laugh at my poor daddy and mammy [<persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLENANTD">Nan</persName>]&#x2019;&#x201D; (pp. 48&#x2013;49). 
                                            A brief Robinsonade ensues until <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> is rescued by an English ship, which carries him to <placeName corresp="#INDIA">India</placeName>.
                                            
                                            Jack serves ably in India, but when his regiment marches within reach of the &#x201C;Tartars&#x201D;, he warns the officers to avoid these warriors&#x02BC; calvary skills. 
                                            His warnings are ignored, resulting in the army&#x02BC;s routing. Jack is taken among the hostages, though &#x201C;he alone, accustomed to all the vicissitudes of life, retain[s] his chearfulness, and [is] 
                                            prepared to meet every reverse of fortune&#x201D; (p. 56). The narrator supplies an anthropological account of the Tartars, preparing to show how Jack ingratiates himself by means of his  
                                            horsemanship. He draws on his smithing to introduce the Tartars to shoeing their horses, on his sadlery to improve the Tartars&#x02BC; gear, and on his regard for animals to train the Tartars&#x02BC; horses for docility without violence. 
                                            When the English negotiate freedom for the hostages, the Tartars present Jack with valuable presents. Returned to the English camp, he secures an honorable discharge.
                                            
                                            Back in England, Jack returns to the iron foundry as a foreman, and ends as a partner. He buys the moor where the old man found him and Nan, 
                                            and on the site of the old man&#x02BC;s hut he builds a &#x201C;small but convenient house&#x201D; where &#x201C;he would sometimes retire from business, and cultivate his garden with his own hands, 
                                            for he hated idleness&#x201D;. He now freely relates his history without fear of mockery, since &#x201C;it is of very little consequence how a man comes into the world, 
                                            provided he behaves well, and discharges his duty when he is in it&#x201D; (pp. 64, 65).

                                    No further indication appears in the family letters that the tale was acquired.<lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    The original ballad relates how a dying man and his wife commend their young son and daughter to the care of the man&#x02BC;s brother. 
                                    After a year of caring for the children, the uncle succumbs to the temptation of their inheritance, 
                                    and hires assassins to convey the children to a wood and murder them. 
                                    One of the would&#x2010;be killers has a change of heart and, to avert the deed, kills his partner, but then abandons the children 
                                    to die of starvation and exposure in the wood. Their bodies are covered with leaves by a robin.<lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    The ballad first appeared in print in 1595 and long held popular appeal in broadside form, 
                                    before becoming an object of antiquarian interest when included in
                                    <title type="anthology" corresp="#PERCYRELIQUES"><hi rend="italic">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</hi></title> compiled by <persName corresp="#TPERCY">Thomas Percy</persName> (1765). 
                                    Patricia Crain has traced the ballad&#x02BC;s &#x201C;life as a printed text and its migration from the ballad canon 
                                    to the children&#x02BC;s literature canon&#x201D; in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries&#x2014;the 
                                    point at which Margaret Ruskin perceived the story as appropriate comfort for an ailing four year old. 
                                    As Crain explains, these &#x201C;genre and format transformations&#x201D; from popular broadside to a children&#x02BC;s book 
                                    &#x201C;converse[d] and coordinate[d] with shifting views and valuations of children&#x02BC;s lives and deaths&#x201D;. 
                                    By 1823, the texts and illustrations designed for child readers, 
                                    which would have been available to the Ruskins, included a prose revision by a pseudonymous &#x201C;Clara English&#x201D;,

                                    published by Darton and Harvey. In this version, the children&#x02BC;s death and avian burial are replaced by their 
                                    rescue and training for useful work in a utopian manufacturing town 
                                    (Crain, Reading Children, 44, 50&#x2013;51). In another prose version, presented as a &#x201C;continuation&#x201D; of the story,

                                    the children wandering in the woods fall into the arms of a kindly hermit, who has retreated to the forest to mourn the abduction of his own children. 
                                    Not only are the children providentially discovered at the hermitage by their father, who is inexplicably alive; the hermit&#x02BC;s lost daughters are revealed and reunited with their father, as well. 
                                    At the same time, the original story was preserved in a prose version published by William Darton,

                                    In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in Britain, the stories relating the various adventures of <title type="story" corresp="#SINBADTHESAILOR">&#x201C;Sinbad the Sailor&#x201D;</title> (or &#x201C;Sindbad&#x201D;) were available

                                    the Sinbad tales first became available to English readers in 1712 via France, where Antoine Galland was producing his translation of the Arabian Nights, Les Mille et Une Nuits (1704&#x2013;17), 
                                    and the Sinbad stories continued to be issued separately throughout the eighteenth century. The Hockliffe copy is an 1805 two&#x2010;volumes&#x2010;in&#x2010;one issue, with engravings, of

                                    Between 1801 and 1818, the Tabart firm produced influential versions of fairy tales, which became standard in spite of opposition by 
                                    Sarah Trimmer. It is possible that the Tabart texts were edited by William Godwin and translated by his second wife, Mary Jane Godwin 
                                    (&#x201C;Fables and Fairy Tales&#x201D;).<lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    If the Ruskins acquired one of these booklets, John may have been introduced to the Sinbad stories long before his exposure 
                                    to the entirety of the Arabian Nights. In John James Ruskin&#x02BC;s extant accounts, the entire collection is first recorded as a purchase in November 1834: 
                                    &#x201C;Arabian Nights 27/&#x201D; (Account Book, 34v; Ruskin Family Letters, ed. Burd, 286 n. 1). No information is given about the translation or edition. 
                                    The most recent widely available English translation of the Arabian Nights was <title type="book" corresp="#LAMBARABIANNIGHTS"><hi rend="italic">The New Arabian Nights&#x02BC; Entertainments</hi></title>, 
                                    translated into German by Jos. von Hammer and, in turn, into English by the Reverend George Lamb. This version was published in 1826 by Colburn and Bentley, 
                                    with a second edition appearing in 1829. This price of this version, however, does not match John James&#x02BC;s expenditure of 27s, 
                                    being consistently advertised in other Bentley publications of the period at 18s for three small octavo volumes, bound in canvas.<lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    In mature writings, Ruskin frequently alluded to the Sinbad stories, especially the story of the Valley of Diamonds, 
                                    on which he based lecture 1, &#x201C;The Valley of Diamonds&#x201D;, in The Ethics of the Dust (1866) (Ruskin, Works, 18:209&#x2013;20).

                                    in 1785 by Thomas Holcroft (1745&#x2013;1809). Burd glosses Ruskin&#x02BC;s copy as a publication of 1817&#x2014;not on the basis,

                                    Initially, Holcroft&#x02BC;s translation was published in five volumes, and sometimes four, while a two&#x2010;volume
