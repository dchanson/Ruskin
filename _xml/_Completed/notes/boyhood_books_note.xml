                <head type="title">Books Used by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in His Youth</head>
                <p>The aim of this note is not to provide an exhaustive listing of books that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> read or consulted in his youth. 
                    Information about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s reading and its influences is available throughout <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, 
                    in the apparatuses and glosses of works containing specific allusions to and borrowings from publications to which he was exposed. 
                    Especially influential authors and published sources, moreover, are discussed in notes of their own. 
                    This information can be accessed using the archive&#x02bc;s Search. A portion of this note does attempt, however, to convey the scope of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s childhood and youthful reading 
                    through a descriptive (but not exhaustive) <ref type="internal" target="#CHRONOLOGY">Chronology</ref> as well as to summarize 
                    <ref type="internal" target="#APPROPRIATE_READING">The Ruskins&#x02BC; Program of Age&#x2010;Appropriate Reading for John</ref>. These resources remain open to development.</p>
                
                <p>Among the main purposes of this note is to centralize some <ref type="internal" target="#RESOURCES">Resources</ref> for researching the Ruskin family reading during <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s youth 
                    by extending and enhancing existing research sources. Included are <ref type="internal" target="#ANNUALLISTS">Lists of Annual Book Purchases by the Ruskin Family</ref>, 
                    <ref type="internal" target="#DESCRIPTIONS">Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Youth</ref>, and 
                    <ref type="internal" target="#UNTRACED">Untraced Books</ref>. These resources build on the enumerative bibliographies 
                    compiled by <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName> in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">The Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref> 
                    (i.e., lists of annual book purchases drawn from <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book, RF MS 28 [<date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1845">1827&#x2013;45</date>]</title></ref>) 
                    and by <persName corresp="#JSD">James S. Dearden</persName> in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">The Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>. 
                    These published print sources remain the starting point for all investigations of the Ruskin family reading, 
                    whereas the lists here propose some additions and extensions. Not listed here are proposed corrections of specific entries in these print bibliographies. 
                    These corrections are found elsewhere in the archive in context of relevant evidence.</p>

                        <head type="subsection">Provenance</head>
                        <p>Assuming that an item of children&#x02BC;s literature can be traced to <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName>, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s final home, its presence in his adult library is only a starting point for extending the item&#x02BC;s provenance 
                            to <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName>, his boyhood home. 
                            <!--even if the item&#x02BC;s .--> 
                            For example, among a <ref type="internal" target="#BEINECKEBOOKS">collection of books held by the <placeName type="building" corresp="#BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke Library</placeName></ref> 
                            supposed to have belonged to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in boyhood, 
                            there are two bound assemblages of separately published works, which were acquired by the collector, 
                            <persName corresp="#FJS">F. J. Sharp</persName>. The responsibility for these bindings is unknown. While some of the individual items contained therein bear 
                            marginalia recognizably in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s mature hand, the evidence for associating each of the items therein 
                            with his boyhood is variable, in some cases amounting to little more than the publication date falling within the relevant range. 
                            As an example of problematic items among the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke</orgName> holdings, a copy of 
                            <title type="lesson" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title> 
                            by <persName corresp="#JAIKIN">John Aikin</persName> and <persName corresp="#ALB">Anna Laetitia Barbauld</persName>, 
                            which is undated on the title page, very likely is not the edition <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> used in boyhood. 
                            While a bookplate authenticates the copy as a <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName> book, 
                            and it contains some annotations in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s mature hand, 
                            other bibliographical details place its acquisition after his boyhood absorption in <title type="lesson" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title>&#x2014;perhaps long after 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#EVENINGS">[<hi rend="italic">Beinecke</hi> 4]</ref>). 
                            As in any case for provenance, one can only weigh the evidence, and one purpose of 
                            <ref type="internal" target="#DESCRIPTIONS">Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Boyhood and Youth</ref> is to compile what is known.</p>
                        
                        <p>A unique boon for tracing the provenance of books to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s boyhood and youth is the record of book and periodical purchases contained in 
                            <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s ledger of household accounts, the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref>. 
                            These brief entries, which <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> included under the heading &#x201C;Sundries&#x201D; for each year, 
                            and which he notated usually with an identification of author and/or title along with the cost, are compiled 
                            by <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName> in the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 
                            collected by year of acquisition and placed among the explanatory notes. <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s sketchy identifications include no publication details, 
                            and some entries can be difficult even to distinguish as books from other kinds of &#x201C;sundries&#x201D;. <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> helpfully links some of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s costs 
                            to prices in publisher&#x02BC;s listings. The researcher should therefore start with <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>&#x02BC;s annotated lists, while what is gathered 
                            in <ref type="internal" target="#ANNUALLISTS">Lists of Annual Book Purchases by the Ruskin Family</ref> are possible additional items found in the 
                            <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref>.</p>
                        
                        <p>A limitation of the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref> 
                            as an indicator of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early reading is that it
                            begins in <date when="1827">1827</date>, omitting records of book purchases prior to his eighth year.  
                            This was the period when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s parents would have acquired many of the publications most commonly associated with Romantic&#x2010;era and early Victorian writing for children, 
                            from fairy tales to moral and scientific dialogues. The gap in the evidence of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s accounts 
                            shifts all the more significance onto the provenance of physical books alleged to have survived from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s boyhood library.</p>
                        
                        <p>Other sources of evidence about the family&#x02BC;s commerce in juvenile literature prior to <date when="1827">1827</date> (and afterward) are found in remarks about books in the family letters, 
                            along with literary allusions detectable in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <date notBefore="1826-01-01" notAfter="1827-12-31">1826&#x2013;27</date> juvenilia. While some of these allusions and passing references 
                            can be cross&#x2010;referenced to bibliographical details known from another source or even to a physical copy, 
                            other references in the letters reveal only a title, which is discussed as an <ref type="internal" target="#UNTRACED">Untraced Book</ref>. 
                            For example, in a letter dated <date when="1823">1823</date>, when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was four years old, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> suggested books to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> 
                            that would make acceptable gifts for <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>: &#x201C;if you bring any thing for him let it be 
                            <title type="story" corresp="#CHILDRENINTHEWOOD">the history of the children of the wood</title> 
                            or <title type="story" corresp="#SINBADTHESAILOR">Sinbad the Sailor</title>&#x2014;since he has been ill 
                            he has had so much medicine to take that I have been obliged to buy I don&#x02BC;t know how many books 
                            and you might perhaps bring him some he has already[.] You can bring nothing he will be so well pleased with as a book&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="letter" corresp="#mr_to_jjr_1823-03-11"><date when="1823-03-11">11 March 1823</date></title>, <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title>, ed. <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName></ref>, 126&#x2013;27). Since no evidence survives attesting whether these books were ever acquired, 
                            or, if purchased, in what edition, the titles are relegated to the list of 
                            <ref type="internal" target="#UNTRACED">Untraced Books</ref> accompanied by discussion of the significance of that choice of text.</p>
                        
                        <p>Another caveat concerning <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s purchases of books and other sundries recorded in his 
                            <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref> is that he rarely indicated 
                            the intended recipient. It is possible that some book titles, especially of children&#x02BC;s literature, may have been meant for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cousins, especially

                            one wonders how far the availability, much less the inheritance, extended in the case of <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName>&#x02bc;s books. 
                            To what extent did <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> and <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> share books? 
                            Similar speculation surrounds duplicate copies found in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s accounts, such as his purchase of a <title type="book" corresp="#DEFOEROBINSONCRUSOE"><hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe</hi></title> in <date when="1835">1835</date>,

                            Alternatively, rather than indicating books purchased for others outside the immediate family, duplicate titles might refer to additional, compact editions to be taken on travels.

                            a cost that presumably could be absorbed within her household budget. As one source for recommended titles, she may have consulted

                        who was generous with purchases of books for his family&#x02bc;s education and entertainment. Still, there is no way of knowing 
                        whether publications that left their influence on the early writings were borrowed or owned,

                        <persName corresp="#FDH">Felicia Hemans</persName> was sufficiently admired for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to have transcribed her poem,

                        Yet <persName corresp="#FDH">Mrs. Hemans</persName> is curiously absent from records of the Ruskins&#x02bc; book ownership, 
                        apart from poems included in literary annuals that the Ruskins are known to have owned. 
                        How publications by <persName corresp="#FDH">Hemans</persName> passed through their hands&#x2014;whether by purchase, borrowing, or casually encountering a periodical&#x2014;remains unknown.</p>
                    
                    <p>Borrowing could have provided a means for <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> to control what books entered the house. 
                        She appears to refer to borrowing, for example, when she writes to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> about the novel,

Since she &#x201c;did not like&#x201d; the novel, 
                        she &#x201c;got the first volume merely to read the History of the three little fishes to <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x201d;. 
                        In this instance, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02bc;s renewed encounter with the novel led to &#x201c;the Almighty open[ing] the understanding&#x201d; on her part, 
                        and she proposed to &#x201c;read it together&#x201d; with <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>. Perhaps only then was the full work acquired for the household,

                        <p>The separately bound collections preserved at the Beinecke appear to reflect this division, 
                            but the elder Ruskins left no indication of what they thought about this controversy between the Romantics and the educationists 
                            or whether they were even aware of it. Recent scholarship has shown how &#x201C;Science&#x201D; and &#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; or 
                            concepts of <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> and <hi rend="italic">imagination</hi> were more entangled 
                            in education and children&#x02BC;s literature of the long <date notBefore="1700" notAfter="1799">eighteenth century</date> than <persName corresp="#CLE">Lamb</persName> cared to admit; 
                            and critics have revolutionized our understanding of how women educationists such as <persName corresp="#ALB">Letitia Barbauld</persName> and <persName corresp="#STRIMMER">Sarah Trimmer</persName> 
                            contributed an alternative sociability and sense of self to Romanticism. Moreover, where <persName corresp="#CLE">Lamb</persName> saw a uniform pedagogy in the women&#x02BC;s &#x201C;nonsense&#x201D;, 
                            scholars have also discerned separate politics in <persName corresp="#ALB">Barbauld</persName>&#x02BC;s Dissenter progressivism and in <persName corresp="#STRIMMER">Trimmer</persName>&#x02BC;s Anglican conservatism. 
                            The Ruskins must have been able to distinguish these differences, as well, yet the evidence points to catholicity in their choices of children&#x02BC;s literature. 
                            They shared neither the Romantics&#x02BC; hostility toward progressive instructional works such as the Edgeworths&#x02BC; practical education 
                            nor <persName corresp="#STRIMMER">Trimmer</persName>&#x02BC;s suspicions of imaginative works such as fairy tales, whether new or traditional.</p>
                        
                        <p>While allowing for catholicity of genres, the elder Ruskins did adhere to a program of graduated and progressive age&#x2010;appropriate reading for children that had been 
                            introduced at the end of the previous century by <persName corresp="#ALB">Mrs. Barbauld</persName> and developed by the Edgeworths. 
                            While precise dates are elusive for when <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> first engaged with many of the works he is known to have read in his youth, 
                            some distinct phases of readings can be discerned. These phases can be correlated to developments in his own writing, 
                            which reflect his reading both in content and the materiality of typography and illustration. The age&#x2010;appropriate layers 
                            of reading are permeable, however, as over time <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> retained his affection for re&#x2010;reading some works for children even into adulthood. 
                            The periods of age&#x2010;appropriate reading into which the following chronology is divided are therefore approximate but not arbitrary, 
                            being based both on available documentation about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s books and on his response to books in his writing.

                        flattens these readings in time, suggesting that his study even of favored works was both simultaneous and compartmentalized. In fact, ,

                                    For them, traditional tales escaped the confines of &#x201C;the social limits and moral laws of the familiar world&#x201D;&#x2014;the boundaries within which the educationists 
                                    aimed to socialize the child subject. The old &#x201C;wild&#x201D; tales, rather, &#x201C;developed in unpredictable ways, rewarding hero or heroine with honours and wealth&#x201D;; and instead of &#x201C;foregrounding actual children&#x201D; as subjects, 
                                    encouraged identification with (in <persName corresp="#STC">Coleridge</persName>&#x02BC;s description) &#x201C;excessive smallness combined with great power&#x201D;, thus &#x201C;exhibiting, through the working of the imagination, the idea of power in the will&#x201D;. 
                                    Such tales as the <title type="story" corresp="#ARABIANNIGHTS">Arabian Nights</title>, <persName corresp="#STC">Coleridge</persName> emphasizes, &#x201C;cause no deep feeling of a moral kind&#x2014;whether of religion or love; but an impulse of motion is communicated to the mind without excitement,

                        <p>Finally, questions of the provenance of publications for children in the Ruskin library are preliminary to the more complex question of what counted for the Ruskins as <hi rend="italic">children&#x02BC;s literature</hi>. 
                            In the first decade of <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s reading, the elder Ruskins&#x02BC; acquisition of books by <persName corresp="#ALB">Letitia Barbauld</persName> and <persName corresp="#ME">Maria Edgeworth</persName> reflect their familiarity 
                            with the concept of age&#x2010;appropriate texts, even though <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> read above the age recommended for certain texts. At the same time, 
                            his parents chose, or he appropriated, texts that were not conceived for a child audience but contained features that appealed to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s imagination&#x2014;for example, 
                            <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#BYRONMANFRED"><hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi></title> and <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY"><hi rend="italic">The Monastery</hi></title> and <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTABBOT"><hi rend="italic">The Abbot</hi></title>.</p>
                        <p> Yet evidence shows that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> both read above his age category 
                            (and not always with comprehension) and ranged beyond the kinds of texts typically thought appropriate for children 
                            (e.g., <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="book" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></title>, which he copied verbatim in <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201c;Harry and Lucy . . .

                        purchased each month of every year, from <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1845">1827 through 1845</date>, in his <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref>. In the ledger, 
                        book purchases are included among many other miscellaneous items on the pages devoted to &#x201c;Sundries&#x201d; for each year. 
                        Because <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> notes the amounts spent, <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> is able in many cases to identify the authors/titles 
                        with specific editions available at the time from publishers at those prices. <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>&#x02bc;s transcriptions and annotations are very reliable, 
                        but should nonetheless be revisited and compared against the manuscript of the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref>, 
                        since <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s entries are sometimes ambiguous. Where appropriate, original entries in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref> are referenced throughout <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>. 
                        Here, for convenience of reference, are listed the page numbers in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref> of <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>&#x02bc;s transcribed lists,

                        presumably because no letters are extant from that year, thus giving no occasion for annotation. 
                        <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName> has incorporated the <date when="1830">1830</date> purchases into the alphabetized entries in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">The Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>; however, 
                        since <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s book lists organized chronologically by year form a helpful comparison 
                        with the discussions of dating works and manuscripts in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, the <date when="1830">1830</date> book list is compiled in its entirety, 
                        cross&#x2010;referenced with entries in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">The Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>. This list and others from <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1845">1827&#x2013;45</date> will be updated 
                        as new information comes to light. More speculatively, annual lists are also compiled 
                        for years prior to the start of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref> in <date when="1827">1827</date>. These identifications are ongoing.</p>
                    
                    <p>Some names are transcribed from <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s &#x201c;Sundries&#x201d; that may or may not refer to books or authors. 
                        <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> often listed names of vendors as shorthand for the wares they supplied, 
                        as well as naming recipients of gifts or purchases. In many cases, it is mere speculation whether a proper name 
                        refers to purchase of a book or of some other kind of item, and these names are flagged as &#x201c;unidentified&#x201d;. 
                        Yet the occurence of some names can sometimes be aligned with other information to identify book titles and authors 
                        at least tentatively. Again, these identifications are ongoing.</p>

                                    The responsibility for and circumstances of binding these three items as &#x201c;Fairy Tales&#x201d; are unknown. 
                                    This title on the spine applies most legitimately to the first of the items, <title type="anthology" corresp="#MOTHERBUNCHSFAIRYTALES"><hi rend="italic">Mother Bunch&#x02bc;s Fairy Tales</hi></title>, 
                                    whereas the other two items belong only marginally, each containing just one or two stories that feature a fairy or fantastical events. 
                                    Regardless of the consistency of the collection, however, an implicit rationale becomes apparent by comparing the contents of another bound collection,

                                    Now highly regarded among collectors, <orgName corresp="#LUMSDENANDSON">Lumsden</orgName>&#x02bc;s children&#x02bc;s books are distinguished by 
                                    &#x201c;a certain trimness (primness one might almost call it) in the covers, the quality of the paper used, 
                                    the excellent type&#x2010;face, the occasional use of coloured inks for text and illustrations, 
                                    usually bistre or sanguine, occasionally green, and a few hand&#x2010;coloured illustrations&#x201d;. 
                                    In their own time, however, the books were apparently little known outside of <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>; 
                                    and even in their own country, they were not widely popular, because their prices were considered 
                                    rather dear, even at two pence or six pence per copy&#x2014;cheaper and less elegant chapbooks by this publisher

                                            was faithful to the original, sophisticated French tales and intended for adult readers.

                                            an English folklore figure whom children could imagine as a storyteller

                                            As pointed out in the &#x201c;Introductory Essay&#x201d; on the copy in the <title type="archive" corresp="#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALESHOCKLIFFE">Hockliffe Archive</title>, 
                                            the tales have no connection with Christmas, despite the anthology&#x02bc;s title, which presumably was a marketing ploy. 
                                            The text, which in some copies includes a description of the Seven Wonders of the World, 
                                            was apparently based on a collection first published in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, ca. <date when="1780">1780</date>

                                            The first story in the collection opens with commentary on the neglect of religion and morality in childhood education, 
                                            but the stories in themselves do little to redress this supposed failing. The collection is miscellaneous, 
                                            some tales teaching prudent and moral conduct, some adopting an oriental flavor, and only a few entailing magic or fairies. 
                                            Two of the latter sort feature dervises (i.e., dervishes), who reward hospitality with magical riches, but retract the reward and punish 
                                            characters who overstep boundaries owing to greed or excess curiosity.<lb/><lb/>

                                    The responsibility for binding these items together is unknown. Although not stated explicitly, <persName corresp="#HGV">Helen Viljoen</persName>&#x02bc;s description in the exhibition catalogue,

                                    that the binding was present when received from the collector, <persName corresp="#FJS">F. J. Sharp</persName> (pp. 6&#x2013;7 [item 5<hi rend="italic">a</hi>]). <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> appears to believe that the binding was present even when &#x201c;given to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> by his <persName corresp="#JJR">Father</persName>&#x201c;, 
                                    but it is unlikely that such disparate items would have been bound together originally.<lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    A rationale, if not the specific occasion for the collection 
                                    can be inferred, however, if the binding of these eight items was made in concert with the binding of <ref type="internal" target="#FAIRYTALESDISCUSSION">Fairy Tales</ref>. 
                                    As compared with the latter, the items collected here share an emphasis on &#x201c;cautionary&#x201d; tales (to draw on the subtitle of <title type="book" corresp="#TURNERTHECOWSLIP"><hi rend="italic">The Cowslip</hi></title>). 
                                    Since the early nineteenth century, such Romantic writers as <persName corresp="#CLE">Charles Lamb</persName>, <persName corresp="#STC">S. T. Coleridge</persName>, and <persName corresp="#WW">William Wordsworth</persName> 
                                    had polemically argued in favor of appealing to children&#x02bc;s imagination with fairy tales as opposed to training their reason and morals 
                                    with &#x201c;instructive&#x201d; and &#x201c;cautionary&#x201d; tales and dialogues by the &#x201c;cursed <persName corresp="#ALB">Barbauld</persName> Crew&#x201d;, as <persName corresp="#CLE">Lamb</persName> anathematized this group largely of women writers. 
                                    In our time, critics have exposed the politics underpinning these divisions, but in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, 
                                    which was probably when these two collections of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s books were bound, the reputation of 
                                    <persName corresp="#ALB">Anna Letitia Barbauld</persName> had been disassociated from her politics and reduced to bland high&#x2010;mindedness&#x2014;a &#x201c;valuation&#x201d; 
                                    of this writing that suggests, as <persName corresp="#WMCCARTHY">William McCarthy</persName> complains, &#x201c;that it entirely lacked humor, irony, or wit&#x201d; 
                                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MCCARTHYBARBAULDRECEPTION"><persName corresp="#WMCCARTHY">McCarthy</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#MCCARTHYBARBAULDRECEPTION">&#x201C;&#x2018;A High&#x2010;Minded Christian Lady&#x2019;&#x201D;</title></ref>, 179; and see 
                                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CLARKEBARBAULDCREW"><persName corresp="#NCLARKE">Clarke</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#CLARKEBARBAULDCREW">&#x201C;&#x2018;The Cursed Barbauld Crew&#x2019;&#x201D;</title></ref>, 91&#x2013;93). 
                                    Such a valuation was perhaps implicitly placed on these eight items by binding them together.<lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    The reductive valuation may not have been <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s, but it seems unlikely that he could have been responsible for binding this collection 
                                    since, as noted in the following descriptions, he annotated some of the items separately, 
                                    bequeathing them to <persName corresp="#JSAR">Joan Severn</persName> and her children. One of the annotations is dated &#x201c;<date when="1889">1889</date>&#x201d;, and another &#x201c;<date notBefore="1889" notAfter="1890">1889&#x2013;1890</date>&#x201d;, 
                                    clues that the binding was ordered after <date when="1890">1890</date> by someone other than <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x2014;perhaps by <persName corresp="#JSAR">Joan Severn</persName>&#x2014;since by that time, 
                                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself would not have been in a mental state to take such an initiative.

                                            The textual history of <title type="lesson" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title> does bear consequences for what edition <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first used. 
                                            In an analysis of the publishing history of the book, <persName corresp="#AFYFE">Aileen Fyfe</persName> explains that, <date notBefore="1792" notAfter="1823">from 1792 until 1823</date>, the text of the first edition was controlled by the first publisher, <persName corresp="#JJPUBLISHER">Joseph Johnson</persName>, 
                                            his successor <orgName corresp="#RHUNTER">Rowland Hunter</orgName>, and other publishers to whom <orgName corresp="#RHUNTER">Hunter</orgName> sold shares. In <date when="1823">1823</date>, to maintain copyright, the shareholders solicited 
                                            a corrected and slightly expanded edition from <persName corresp="#JAIKIN">John Aikin</persName>&#x02BC;s son, <persName corresp="#AAIKIN">Arthur Aikin</persName>, which was published as the thirteenth edition, apparently in six volumes; 
                                            and in <date when="1826">1826</date>, an edition rearranged by <persName corresp="#JAIKIN">John Aikin</persName>&#x02BC;s daughter, <persName corresp="#LAIKIN">Lucy Aikin</persName>, was published in four volumes. Despite these new editions descending from the original,
                                            &#x201C;from the <date notBefore="1823" notAfter="1826">mid&#x2010;1820s</date>&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#AFYFE">Fyfe</persName> notes, &#x201C;any publisher could print the original text of <title type="book" corresp="#AIKENBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title>, and a number did so&#x201D;, including 
                                            provincial and Scottish publishers (<persName corresp="#AFYFE">Fyfe</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#FYFECOPYRIGHTS">&#x201C;Copyrights and Competition&#x201D;</title>, 40). If <persName corresp="#JFDOVE">Dove</persName> waited until <date when="1827">1827</date> to reprint <title type="lesson" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings</hi></title>, even in its original text, 
                                            he already lagged behind some other publishers.<lb/><lb/>
                                            
                                            The Ruskins would have entered the market for <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s initial copy of <title type="lesson" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title> 
                                            during the transitional period in the book&#x02BC;s publishing history, between the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1826">early&#x2010; and mid&#x2010;1820s</date>, when the Aikins were revising the text in order to extend copyright, 
                                            and when other publishers were issuing reprints of the first edition. At this point, the Ruskins would likely have acquired either the new edition of <date when="1823">1823</date>, 
                                            whose shareholder publishers included (since <date when="1815">1815</date>) <orgName corresp="#BALDWINCRADOCKANDJOY">Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy</orgName>, who also published the Ruskins&#x02BC; editions of <persName corresp="#ME">Maria Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="series" corresp="#EDGEWORTHEARLYLESSONS">&#x201C;Early Lessons&#x201D;</title> series; 
                                            or they would have purchased a first&#x2010;edition reprint available from non&#x2010;shareholder publishers. At that time, those non&#x2010;shareholder reprints 
                                            would not have included <persName corresp="#JFDOVE">Dove</persName>&#x02BC;s, since, as we have seen, evidence shows him coming late to the game. Consequently, putting aside the <persName corresp="#FJS">Sharp</persName>/<persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> <persName corresp="#JFDOVE">Dove</persName> edition&#x2014;undated, but probably after <date when="1827">1827</date>&#x2014;we 
                                            cannot determine what state of the text of <title type="lesson" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title> was availble to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in his boyhood six&#x2010;volume version, whether the revised edition by <persName corresp="#AAIKIN">Arthur Aikin</persName> or the original descended from the <persName corresp="#JJPUBLISHER">Johnson</persName>/<orgName corresp="#RHUNTER">Hunter</orgName> shareholders (or even as originally published by <persName corresp="#JJPUBLISHER">Johnson</persName>/<orgName corresp="#RHUNTER">Hunter</orgName>). 
                                            A good bet may be the revised text of <date when="1823">1823</date>, since the shareholders carrying that text, including <orgName corresp="#BALDWINCRADOCKANDJOY">Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy</orgName>, produced substantial print runs that sold well 
                                                (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FYFECOPYRIGHTS"><persName corresp="#AFYFE">Fyfe</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#FYFECOPYRIGHTS">&#x201C;Copyrights and Competition&#x201D;</title></ref>, 43); and the Ruskins were familiar with <orgName corresp="#BALDWINCRADOCKANDJOY">Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy</orgName> 
                                                from their purchase of <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="lesson" corresp="#EDGEWORTHFRANK"><hi rend="italic">Frank</hi></title> and <title type="lesson" corresp="#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><hi rend="italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</hi></title>. 
                                                Definitive evidence, however, must await recovery of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s three stray volumes, as rebound by <orgName corresp="#SIMPSONANDCO">Simpson</orgName>.<lb/><lb/>
                                            
                                            As for the <persName corresp="#FJS">Sharp</persName>/<persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> copy, given that it contains annotations by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> from later years, a plausible explanation may be that he acquired this <persName corresp="#JFDOVE">Dove</persName> edition at some point to replace the missing volumes of his boyhood set, 
                                            at or before the time of sending the surviving copies for rebinding; or, if the <persName corresp="#JFDOVE">Dove</persName> reprint was a more youthful acquisition, it should be treated as an additional household copy, circa <date when="1830">1830</date>. 
                                            While the front endpaper contains illegible scrawls, one of which <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> was tempted to make out to be the letter <hi rend="italic">J</hi> and interpret as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s earliest signature, 
                                            all the legible marginalia is in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s mature hand. 
                                            The back endpaper has the note: &#x201c;p 315. Earth &#x0026; Stones &#x2014; 331&#x201d;, referring to

                    the hand of John James Ruskin; then, on a blank page which follows [i.e., the

                                            On <date when="1803-06-28">June 28</date>, on a foggy night, the ship collided with a huge iceberg and rapidly sank. Twenty&#x2010;nine surviors filled two small boats carried by the packet, 
                                            including the captain, <persName corresp="#WDF">William Dorset Fellowes</persName> (<date notBefore="1769" notAfter="1852">1769&#x2013;1852</date>), the French captain, three women (one of them <persName corresp="#WDF">Fellowes</persName>&#x02BC;s spouse), and seamen. 
                                            The boats carried few provisions, and for seven days the castaways suffered from exposure, hunger, and thirst, 
                                            causing the French commander in a delirium to throw himself into the sea and drown. Nearing the Canadian coast, the boats were rescued on <date when="1803-07-04">4 July</date>. 
                                            <persName corresp="#WDF">Fellowes</persName> published an account of the ordeal, <title type="book" corresp="#FELLOWESNARRATIVE"><hi rend="italic">A Narrative of the Loss of His Majesty&#x02BC;s Packet, the Lady Hobart</hi></title>.

                                            where he has built a hut and grows his own vegetables (p. 3). Although poor, he is content, having &#x201C;&#x2018;avoided, perhaps, many faults, 
                                            and much uneasiness, which I should have incurred had I been in another situation&#x201D; (p. 19). He owns &#x201C;one domestic&#x201D; and &#x201C;friend&#x201D; (pp. 4&#x2013;5), a goat named <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLENANTD">Little Nan</persName>, 
                                            which he rescued as a kid. Finding the infant likewise abandoned on the moor, the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#OLDMANTD">old man</persName> trusts &#x201C;Providence which feeds the birds of the wood 
                                            and the beasts of the field, and which has promised to bless all those that are kind and charitable&#x201D; (p. 6). So it is that <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLENANTD">Nan</persName>, 
                                            having &#x201C;lost her kid&#x201D;, willingly suckles the infant, &#x201C;seem[ing] to adopt him with equal tenderness as her offspring&#x201D; (pp. 7, 8). 
                                            &#x201C;&#x2018;Who knows&#x2019;&#x201D;, concludes the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#OLDMANTD">old man</persName>, &#x201C;&#x2018;but Providence, which has preserved this child in so wonderful a manner, 
                                            may have destined it to something equally wonderful in its future life; and may bless me as the humble agent of its decrees&#x2019;&#x201D; (p. 8).<lb/><lb/>
                                            
                                            A Rousseauvian savage, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Little Jack</persName> is &#x201C;left to nature&#x201D; to grow; and since he is &#x201C;unfettered by bandages or restraints&#x201D; and wears &#x201C;neither shoes nor stockings, nor shirt&#x201D;, 
                                            &#x201C;his limbs&#x201D; attain &#x201C;their due proportions and form&#x201D; (pp. 9, 10). A lady passing in her carriage hears his story, and although she 
                                            &#x201C;had seen a great deal of the world, and had read a variety of books, it had never once entered into her head that a child might grow strong and vigorous by sucking a goat, 
                                            instead of eating pap&#x201D; (p. 14). She offers to take him in, but, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> refusing, gives him money for shoes and stockings. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> dutifully attempts to discharge the charity, 
                                            but finds the shoes so cumbersome that he uses the money to buy his &#x201C;daddy&#x201D; a warm coat instead.<lb/><lb/>

                                            <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> is &#x201C;not able to talk as finely about love, tenderness, and sensibility, as many other little boys, 
                                            that have enjoyed greater advantages of education&#x201D;. Nonetheless, like <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYTD">Harry Sandford</persName> compared to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy Merton</persName>, 
                                            <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> feels &#x201C;the reality&#x201D; of such emotions &#x201C;in his heart, and thought it . . . natural to love every thing that loves us&#x201D; (p. 13). 
                                            <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> has one fault, however, of being &#x201C;a little too jealous of his honour&#x201D;, which he is able to defend with &#x201C;such dispositions for the art of boxing, 
                                            that he could beat every boy in the neighbourhood, of his age and size&#x201D; (pp. 16&#x2013;17). 
                                            (The plate showing <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> boxing with <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMCOLLIERTD">Tom the Collier</persName> is the only cut that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did not outline on the reverse.)<lb/><lb/>
                                            
                                            When <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> is twelve, the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#OLDMANTD">old man</persName> dies. In his grief, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> desperately tries to restore warmth to the corpse by stripping naked and lying atop him. 
                                            A local farmer who is acquainted with <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> takes him in and teaches him farmwork, but the farmer dies as well. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> resolutely sets out to find other means to support himself. 
                                            Chancing on an iron foundry, he is drawn to its warmth and shelter. The industry contrasts with his agrarian upbringing, but his straigtforward account of himself leads to a position. 
                                            Because he is incautiously open about his history, however, the other boys tease him, provoking <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> to frequent fistfights.
                                            
                                            One day, the foundry is toured by gentlemen and ladies. (The foundry processes are detailed sufficiently to form a brief example of the factory tour genre.) 
                                            The visit is interrupted by the disturbance of another fight, causing the master to threaten <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> with dismissal. 
                                            The foreman interjects how <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> is a dependable workman, and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> stoutly defends his behavior, describing how the boys mock his strange upbringing. 
                                            While the visitors also cannot restrain their laughter at the story of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLENAN">Nan</persName>, the company happens to include the lady who had heard the story previously and given him money for shoes. 
                                            She once again offers to take <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> into service, and he accepts.
                                            
                                            &#x201C;Call him a little soldier, and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> was at every one&#x02BC;s disposal. This was <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName>&#x02BC;s particular foible and vanity&#x201D;, imitating his daddy, the old soldier, 
                                            by &#x201C;poising a dung&#x2010;fork, charging with a broom&#x2010;stick, and standing sentry at the stable&#x2010;door&#x201D; (p. 31). He also developes an &#x201C;immoderate love of horses&#x201D; (p. 32); 
                                            and building on his experience at the foundry, learns some smithing, sadlery, and carpentry. His resourcefulnesss makes him useful and entertaining to his mistress&#x02BC;s orphaned nephew, 
                                            young <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WILLETSTD">Master Willets</persName>. Allowed to be on familiar terms with the boy, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> listens to <persName corresp="#WILLETSTD">Master Willets</persName>&#x02BC;s lessons, and practices writing and studying on his own at night.
                                            
                                            This happiness comes to an end when <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WILLETSTD">Master Willets</persName> is visited by a young gentleman &#x201C;with a very great taste for finery, and a supreme contempt for all the vulgar&#x201D; (p. 37). 
                                            The gentleman of course cannot abide <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName>, and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> resents the injury to his honor. Happening to acquire a monkey from a showman, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> outfits the animal as a parody of the gentleman, 
                                            inciting the gentlemen to cruelly slay the monkey and receive a harmless indignity in return. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> refuses to apologize, and his &#x201C;obstinacy&#x201D; leads to his dismissal (p. 42).
                                            
                                            Coming at last to his adoptive father&#x02BC;s profession, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> enlists as a marine and is sent to <placeName corresp="#INDIA">India</placeName>. While pausing to hunt on an island, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> is separated from his party and loses his way. 
                                            Fearing to be treated by the natives &#x201C;as the white men generally treat the blacks when they get them into their possession&#x201D;, 
                                            <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> decides to survive on his own, content to be rid of anyone &#x201C;&#x2018;to quarrel with me, or baa, or laugh at my poor daddy and mammy [<persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLENANTD">Nan</persName>]&#x2019;&#x201D; (pp. 48&#x2013;49). 
                                            A brief Robinsonade ensues until <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> is rescued by an English ship, which carries him to <placeName corresp="#INDIA">India</placeName>.
                                            
                                            <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> serves ably in <placeName corresp="#INDIA">India</placeName>, but when his regiment marches within reach of the &#x201C;Tartars&#x201D;, he warns the officers to avoid these warriors&#x02BC; calvary skills. 
                                            His warnings are ignored, resulting in the army&#x02BC;s routing. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> is taken among the hostages, though &#x201C;he alone, accustomed to all the vicissitudes of life, retain[s] his chearfulness, and [is] 
                                            prepared to meet every reverse of fortune&#x201D; (p. 56). The narrator supplies an anthropological account of the Tartars, preparing to show how <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> ingratiates himself by means of his  
                                            horsemanship. He draws on his smithing to introduce the Tartars to shoeing their horses, on his sadlery to improve the Tartars&#x02BC; gear, and on his regard for animals to train the Tartars&#x02BC; horses for docility without violence. 
                                            When the English negotiate freedom for the hostages, the Tartars present <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> with valuable presents. Returned to the English camp, he secures an honorable discharge.
                                            
                                            Back in <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> returns to the iron foundry as a foreman, and ends as a partner. He buys the moor where the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#OLDMANTD">old man</persName> found him and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLENANTD">Nan</persName>, 
                                            and on the site of the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#OLDMANTD">old man</persName>&#x02BC;s hut he builds a &#x201C;small but convenient house&#x201D; where &#x201C;he would sometimes retire from business, and cultivate his garden with his own hands, 
                                            for he hated idleness&#x201D;. He now freely relates his history without fear of mockery, since &#x201C;it is of very little consequence how a man comes into the world, 
                                            provided he behaves well, and discharges his duty when he is in it&#x201D; (pp. 64, 65).

The tale was widely familiar to child readers, but in starkly differing versions.<lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    The original ballad relates how a dying man and his wife commend their young son and daughter to the care of the man&#x02BC;s brother. 
                                    After a year of caring for the children, the uncle succumbs to the temptation to steal their inheritance, 
                                    and hires assassins to convey the children to a wood and murder them. 
                                    One of the would&#x2010;be killers has a change of heart and, to avert the deed, kills his partner, but then abandons the children 
                                    to die of starvation and exposure in the wood. Their bodies are covered with leaves by a robin.<lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    The ballad first appeared in print in <date when="1595">1595</date> and long held popular appeal in broadside form, 
                                    before becoming an object of antiquarian interest when included in

                                    <persName corresp="#PCRAIN">Patricia Crain</persName> has traced the ballad&#x02BC;s &#x201C;life as a printed text and its migration from the ballad canon 
                                    to the children&#x02BC;s literature canon&#x201D; in the <date notBefore="1767" notAfter="1834">late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries</date>&#x2014;the

                                    As <persName corresp="#PCRAIN">Crain</persName> explains, these &#x201C;genre and format transformations&#x201D; from popular broadside to a children&#x02BC;s book

                                    Not only are the children providentially discovered at the hermitage by their father, who is inexplicably alive; the hermit&#x02BC;s own lost daughters are revealed and reunited with their father, as well. 
                                    At the same time, the original story was preserved in a prose version published by <persName corresp="#WDARTON">William Darton</persName>,

                                    In the <date notBefore="1700" notAfter="1799">eighteenth century</date>, English readers were introduced to the <title type="anthology" corresp="#ARABIANNIGHTS"><hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights</hi></title> by way of <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>,

                                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ALISCHEHERAZADEINENGLAND"><persName corresp="#MJA">Ali</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#ALISCHEHERAZADEINENGLAND"><hi rend="italic">Scheherazade in England</hi></title></ref>, 11). In the course of the century, 
                                    the <title type="story" corresp="#SINBADTHESAILOR"><hi rend="italic">Sinbad</hi></title> tales, like other favorite portions of the <title type="anthology" corresp="#ARABIANNIGHTS"><hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights</hi></title>, 
                                    became part of the popular literature that entertained children, though not intended specifically for them. 
                                    As <persName corresp="#MOGRENBY">M. O. Grenby</persName> characterizes the development of an English children&#x02BC;s canon, popular tales were not displaced by the new, <date notBefore="1767" notAfter="1799">late eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> literature devised especially for children, 
                                    but absorbed into it (<persName corresp="#MOGRENBY">Grenby</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#GRENBYCHILDREADER"><hi rend="italic">The Child Reader</hi></title>, 111, and see 94, 96, 109).<lb/><lb/>
                                    
                                    Such assimilation may have came about over the objections of writers with a more exclusive plan for children&#x2014;whether plans for practical education like the Edgeworths&#x02BC; 
                                    or for religious orthodoxy like <persName corresp="#STRIMMER">Sarah Trimmer</persName>&#x02BC;s&#x2014;but the Arabian Nights tales seem to have been allowed exceptional approval. 
                                    The objections by neoclassicists to the extravagance of Eastern tales were countered by positive comparisons 
                                    of the <title type="story" corresp="#SINBADTHESAILOR">Sinbad</title> stories to Western classical literature, such as the voyages of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#ULYSSES">Odysseus</persName>

                                    Shifting ground from neoclassical aesthetics altogether, in an essay exploring how and why readers find pleasure in &#x201C;well&#x2010;wrought scenes of artificial terror . . . formed by a sublime and vigorous imagination&#x201D;,

                                    By the <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1825">first quarter of the nineteenth century</date>, British essayists nostalgically associated the <title type="anthology" corresp="#ARABIANNIGHTS"><hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights&#x02BC; Entertainments</hi></title> with the wonder and enchantment of childhood reading,
