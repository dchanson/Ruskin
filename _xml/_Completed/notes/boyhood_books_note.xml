                <head type="title">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth</head>
                <p>The aim of this note is not to attempt an exhaustive listing of books that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> read or consulted in his youth. 
                    Information about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s reading and its influences is available throughout <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, 
                    in the apparatuses and glosses of works containing specific allusions to and borrowings from publications to which he was exposed. 
                    Especially influential authors and published sources, moreover, are discussed in notes of their own. 
                    This information can be accessed using the site&#x02bc;s search engine.</p>
                
                <p>The purpose of the present note is, rather, to centralize <ref type="internal" target="#RESOURCES">Resources</ref> for researching the Ruskin family reading, 
                    by extending and enhancing existing research sources. Included are <ref type="internal" target="#ANNUALLISTS">Lists of Annual Book Purchases by the Ruskin Family</ref>, 
                    and <ref type="internal" target="#DESCRIPTIONS">Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Youth</ref>. 
                    These resources build on the enumerative bibliographies compiled by <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName> in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">The Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref> 
                    (i.e., lists of annual book purchases drawn from <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book, RF MS 28, <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1845">1827&#x2013;45</date></title></ref>); 
                    and by <persName corresp="#JSD">James S. Dearden</persName> in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">The Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>. Those sources remain a starting point for all investigations of the Ruskin family reading. 
                    The resources provided here to supplement those bibliographies are prefaced by some remarks, <ref type="internal" target="#RESEARCHING">On Researching <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s Reading in His Youth</ref>.</p>
                
                <div type="section" xml:id="RESEARCHING">
                    <head type="section">On Researching Ruskin&#x02bc;s Reading in His Youth</head>
                    
                    <p>Regarding the Ruskin family&#x02bc;s ownership or consultation of a given title at a given time, a measure of uncertainty will always be attached to 
                        documentable evidence of its presence in the family library&#x2014;or for that matter, to the absence of such evidence. 
                        For example, the fact that <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> purchased a book designed for youth does not necessarily mean it was intended for <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>; 
                        some purchases may have been intended as gifts for <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02bc;s cousins, especially for 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_mary_note.php"><persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName> (<date notBefore="1815" notAfter="1849">1815&#x2013;49</date>)</ref>, 
                        who lived with the Ruskin family from <date when="1828">1828</date> to her marriage in <date when="1848">1848</date>. While <persName corresp="#JSD">James S. Dearden</persName> comments about the family library that 
                        &#x201c;the books owned by all three Ruskins must be considered to be part of &#x2018;Ruskin&#x02bc;s Library&#x2019; because he ultimately inherited his parents&#x02bc; possessions, 
                        as well as having the use of them during their lifetimes&#x201d;, one wonders how far the availability, much less the inheritance, 
                        extended in the case of <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName>&#x02bc;s books. <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName> is right to conclude with the caveat that, 
                        &#x201c;although <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s lifetime&#x02bc;s library was much greater than it was at any <hi rend="italic">one</hi> time, 
                        we do not know its total extent&#x201d; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, xv, xxiv). The most valuable evidence that <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> can contribute to the question of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s reading lies 
                        in the edited texts, which can reveal lexical traces of readings that may have left no material trace in the family record.</p>
                    
                    <p>As <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName> remarks, in adulthood <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> &#x201c;was essentially . . . a book&#x2010;buyer rather than a book borrower or library user&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, xix), a habit that appears to have been inherited from his father, 
                        who was generous with purchases of books for his family&#x02bc;s education and entertainment. Still, there is no way of knowing 
                        whether publications that left their influence in the early manuscripts were borrowed or owned, 
                        if otherwise unrecorded as part of the family library in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</date>. For example, 
                        <persName corresp="#FDH">Felicia Hemans</persName> was sufficiently admired for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to have transcribed her poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#HEMANSSOUNDOFTHESEA">&#x201c;The Sound of the Sea&#x201d;</title> (<date when="1826">1826</date>) in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIVB">MS IVB</title>, 
                        probably based on the text as published in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#NEWMONTHLYMAGAZINE"><hi rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine</hi></title>. He also adapted passages from <persName corresp="#FDH">Hemans</persName>&#x02bc;s long poem, 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#HEMANSRESTORATIONWORKSOFART"><hi rend="italic">The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy</hi></title>, published by <orgName corresp="#MURRAY">Murray</orgName> in <date when="1816">1816</date>, for use in his own poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSALTZBURG">&#x201c;Saltzburg&#x201d;</title>. 
                        Yet <persName corresp="#FDH">Mrs. Hemans</persName> is curiously absent from records of the Ruskins&#x02bc; book ownership, 
                        apart from poems included in literary annuals that the Ruskins are known to have owned. 
                        How publications by <persName corresp="#FDH">Hemans</persName> passed through their hands&#x2014;whether by purchase, borrowing, or just casually encountering a periodical outside the house&#x2014;will probably remain a mystery.</p>
                    
                    <p>Borrowing could have provided a means for <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> to control what books entered the house. 
                        She appears to refer to borrowing, for example, when she writes to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> about the novel, 
                        <title type="book" corresp="#BROOKEFOOLOFQUALITY"><hi rend="italic">The Fool of Quality</hi></title> (<date notBefore="1766" notAfter="1772">1766&#x2013;72</date>) by <persName corresp="#HBROOKE">Henry Brooke</persName> (<date notBefore="1703" notAfter="1783">1703&#x2013;83</date>). Since she &#x201c;did not like&#x201d; the novel, 
                        she &#x201c;got the first volume merely to read the History of the three little fishes to <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x201d;. 
                        In this instance, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02bc;s renewed encounter with the novel led to &#x201c;the Almighty open[ing] the understanding&#x201d;, 
                        and she decided to &#x201c;read it together&#x201d; with <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>. Perhaps only then was the full work acquired for the household, 
                        perhaps in the abridgement of the novel by <persName corresp="#JWESLEY">John Wesley</persName> 
                        (<ref type="apparatus" target="mr_to_jjr_1826-05-15_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="#mr_to_jjr_1826-05-15">Margaret to John James Ruskin, 15 May 1826</title></ref>, <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref> 145; <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">The Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, 51 [no. 336];

                    <p>On travels, the Ruskins supplemented books they brought with them by tapping resources along the way; for example, 
                        during the tour of <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName> in <date when="1833">1833</date>, when <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> fell ill, his father and cousin <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> cheered him up by finding 
                        &#x201c;some English books from a library&#x201d; along with &#x201c;2 or 3 volumes of <title type="periodical" corresp="#GALIGNANISMAGAZINE">Gagliani&#x02bc;s Magazine</title>&#x201d;&#x2014;that is, 
                        one of the periodicals issued by <orgName corresp="#GALIGNANI">Librairie Galignani</orgName>, the Paris&#x2010;based English&#x2010;language publisher, bookseller, and circulating library, 
                        which published two monthly journals, the <title type="periodical" corresp="#GALIGNANIREPERTORY"><hi rend="italic">Repertory</hi></title> (ca. <date notBefore="1807" notAfter="1825">1807&#x2013;25</date>), and 
                        <title type="periodical" corresp="#GALIGNANISMAGAZINE"><hi rend="italic">Galignani&#x02bc;s Monthly Review and Magazine</hi></title> (ca. <date notBefore="1822" notAfter="1825">1822&#x2013;25</date>), 
                        as well as a daily, the <title type="periodical" corresp="#GALIGNANIMESSENGER"><hi rend="italic">Messenger</hi></title> (ca. <date notBefore="1814" notAfter="1904">1814&#x2013;1904</date>). 
                        <orgName corresp="#GALIGNANI">Galignani</orgName> also published a series, <title type="series" corresp="#STANDARDMODERNNOVELS"><hi rend="italic">Standard Modern Novels and Romances</hi></title>, 
                        which supplied English travelers and expatriates with contemporary British poetry and prose. 
                        The editions were issued in duodecimo, a size convenient for travel, but printed using excellent type and engravings, 
                        and edited for correct and complete text&#x2014;in some cases, text more complete and reliable than what could be found in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> editions. 
                        As piracies, the volumes were priced significantly cheaper than corresponding <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> editions, 
                        and sold in paper&#x2010;covered boards&#x2014;volumes that could be shared among travelers at a hotel and left behind for others&#x02bc; enjoyment. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did retain from boyhood one of <orgName corresp="#GALIGNANI">Galignani</orgName>&#x02bc;s outstanding volumes in the series 
                        (possibly obtained from a <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> seller rather than from abroad)&#x2014;<title type="book" corresp="#POETICALWORKSETAL"><hi rend="italic">The Complete Poetical Works of Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats</hi></title> (<date when="1829">1829</date>), 
                        an edition that, at the time of publication, was superior to any British edition of <persName corresp="#PBS">Percy Shelley</persName>, 
                        and the only edition of <persName corresp="#JKEATS">Keats</persName> available in collected form 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48"><title type="transcript" corresp="#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</title></ref>, 106; 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BARBERGALIGNANI"><persName corresp="#GBARBER">Barber</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#BARBERGALIGNANI">&#x201c;Galignani&#x02bc;s and the Publication of English Books in France&#x201d;</title></ref>, 269, 284, 272&#x2013;74;
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">The Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, 76 [no. 556]).</p>
                    
                    <p>Besides the possibility that books were borrowed, another kind of caveat should be applied to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s retrospective accounts of his boyhood reading. 
                        The authors and titles he mentions in the opening chapters of <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> are not untrue to his early reading, 
                        but his account of how he both loved certain books and resisted others has charmed readers 
                        into fixating on a short list of titles that is potentially misleading. First, the list is highly selective&#x2014;contrasting, 
                        for dramatic effect, the enforced Sunday reading of <persName corresp="#JBUNYAN">John Bunyan</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="book" corresp="#BUNYANPILGRIMSPROGRESS"><hi rend="italic">Pilgrim&#x02bc;s Progress</hi></title> and <persName corresp="#DDEFOE">Daniel Defoe</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="book" corresp="#DEFOEROBINSONCRUSOE"><hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe</hi></title> 
                        with weekday &#x201c;reading of my own election&#x201d; of <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s novels and <persName corresp="#HOMER">Homer</persName> (<persName corresp="#APOPE">Alexander Pope</persName>&#x02bc;s translation of the <title type="poem" corresp="#ILIAD">&#x201c;Iliad&#x201d;</title>)&#x2014;but, as shown in 
                        <ref type="internal" target="#DESCRIPTIONS">Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Youth</ref>, these classics were mixed in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s juvenile library 
                        with works both secular and Sabbatarian that now seem much more ephemeral. Second, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s retrospection 
                        flattens these readings in time, suggesting that his study even of favored works was both simultaneous and compartmentalized. In fact, even if true that his reading was subject to this weekly division, 
                        his reading was also regulated by competing programs. Moreover, the books themselves and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s responses to them did not necessarily adhere to the categories assigned to them. 
                        As shown in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> commentary and in the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, the Ruskins, no less than other middle&#x2010;class families, attempted to follow 
                        the program of graduated, age&#x2010;appropriate reading for children as recommended by educationists like the Barbaulds and Edgeworths. 
                        Yet <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s writings in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> also reflect his tendency to buck the program, by reading texts above his years 
                        (e.g., <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="book" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></title>, which he copied verbatim in <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201c;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I&#x201d;</title>, but which are too advanced for that context). 
                        Moreover, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and his mother shared weekday reading, in which the religious influences were likely more powerful and memorable to him 
                        (e.g., the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WHITELADY">White Lady</persName> as a protector of <orgName corresp="#PROTESTANTISM">Protestantism</orgName> in <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY"><hi rend="italic">The Monastery</hi></title>) than the Sunday sermons he attempted to copy.</p>

                    <p>In <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">The Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName> transcribes <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s brief notations of authors and/or titles that he 
                        purchased each month of every year, from <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1845">1827 through 1845</date>, in his <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref>. In the ledger, 
                        book purchases are included among many other miscellaneous items on the pages devoted to &#x201c;Sundries&#x201d; for each year. 
                        Because <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> notes the amounts spent, <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> is able in many cases to identify the authors/titles 
                        with specific editions available at the time from publishers at those prices. <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>&#x02bc;s transcriptions and annotations are very reliable, 
                        but should nonetheless be revisited and compared against the manuscript of the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref>, 
                        since <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s entries are sometimes ambiguous. Where appropriate, original entries in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref> are referenced throughout <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>. 
                        Here, for convenience of reference, are listed the page numbers in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref> of <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>&#x02bc;s transcribed lists, 
                        along with the corresponding pages of &#x201c;Sundries&#x201d; in the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref>. Here also are expansions and suggested corrections of <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>&#x02bc;s lists.</p>
                        
                    <p><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> omitted one year of sundry book purchases, those for <date when="1830">1830</date>, from <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 
                        presumably because no letters are extant from that year, thus giving no occasion for annotation. 
                        <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName> has incorporated the <date when="1830">1830</date> purchases into the alphabetized entries in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">The Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>; however, 
                        since <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s book lists organized chronologically by year form a helpful comparison 
                        with the discussions of dating works and manuscripts in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, the <date when="1830">1830</date> book list is compiled in its entirety, 
                        cross&#x2010;referenced with entries in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">The Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>. This list and others from <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1845">1827&#x2013;45</date> will be updated 
                        as new information comes to light. More speculatively, annual lists are also compiled 
                        for years prior to the start of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book</title></ref> in <date when="1827">1827</date>. These identifications are ongoing.</p>
                    
                    <p>Some names are transcribed from <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s &#x201c;Sundries&#x201d; that may or may not refer to books or authors. 
                        <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> often listed names of vendors as shorthand for the wares they supplied, 
                        as well as naming recipients of gifts or purchases. In many cases, it is mere speculation whether a proper name 
                        refers to purchase of a book or of some other kind of item, and these names are flagged as &#x201c;unidentified&#x201d;. 
                        Yet the occurence of some names can sometimes be aligned with other information to identify book titles and authors 
                        at least tentatively. Again, these identifications are ongoing.</p>

                                    The responsibility for and circumstances of binding these three items as &#x201c;Fairy Tales&#x201d; are unknown. 
                                    This title on the spine applies most legitimately to the first of the items, <title type="anthology" corresp="#MOTHERBUNCHSFAIRYTALES"><hi rend="italic">Mother Bunch&#x02bc;s Fairy Tales</hi></title>, 
                                    whereas the other two items belong only marginally, each containing just one or two stories that feature a fairy or fantastical events. 
                                    Regardless of the consistency of the collection, however, an implicit rationale becomes apparent by comparing the contents of another bound collection,

                                    &#x201c;a certain trimness (primness one might almost call it) in the covers, the quality of the paper used, 
                                    the excellent type&#x2010;face, the occasional use of coloured inks for text and illustrations, 
                                    usually bistre or sanguine, occasionally green, and a few hand&#x2010;coloured illustrations&#x201d;. 
                                    In their own time, however, the books were apparently little known outside of <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>; 
                                    and even in their own country, they were not widely popular, because their prices were considered 
                                    rather dear, even at two pence or six pence per copy&#x2014;cheaper and less elegant chapbooks by this publisher

                                            As pointed out in the &#x201c;Introductory Essay&#x201d; on the copy in the <title type="archive" corresp="#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALESHOCKLIFFE">Hockliffe Archive</title>, 
                                            the tales have no connection with Christmas, despite the anthology&#x02bc;s title, which presumably was a marketing ploy. 
                                            The text, which in some copies includes a description of the Seven Wonders of the World, 
                                            was apparently based on a collection first published in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, ca. <date when="1780">1780</date> 
                                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALESHOCKLIFFE"><title type="archive" corresp="#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALESHOCKLIFFE">&#x201C;Stories before 1850. 0220: Anon.

                                            The first story in the collection opens with commentary on the neglect of religion and morality in childhood education, 
                                            but the stories in themselves do little to redress this supposed failing. The collection is miscellaneous, 
                                            some tales teaching prudent and moral conduct, some adopting an oriental flavor, and only a few entailing magic or fairies. 
                                            Two of the latter sort feature dervises (i.e., dervishes), who reward hospitality with magical riches, but retract the reward and punish 
                                            characters who overstep boundaries owing to greed or excess curiosity.<lb/><lb/>

                                    The responsibility for binding these items together is unknown. A rationale, if not the specific occasion for the collection 
                                    can be inferred, however, if the binding of these eight items was made in concert with the binding of <ref type="internal" target="#FAIRYTALESDISCUSSION">Fairy Tales</ref>. 
                                    As compared with the latter, the items collected here share an emphasis on &#x201c;cautionary&#x201d; tales (to draw on the subtitle of <title type="book" corresp="#TURNERTHECOWSLIP"><hi rend="italic">The Cowslip</hi></title>). 
                                    Since the early nineteenth century, such Romantic writers as <persName corresp="#CLE">Charles Lamb</persName>, <persName corresp="#STC">S. T. Coleridge</persName>, and <persName corresp="#WW">William Wordsworth</persName> 
                                    had polemically argued in favor of appealing to children&#x02bc;s imagination with fairy tales as opposed to training their reason and morals 
                                    with &#x201c;instructive&#x201d; and &#x201c;cautionary&#x201d; tales and dialogues by the &#x201c;cursed <persName corresp="#ALB">Barbauld</persName> Crew&#x201d;, as <persName corresp="#CLE">Lamb</persName> anathematized this group largely of women writers. 
                                    In our time, critics have exposed the politics underpinning these divisions, but in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, 
                                    which was probably when a number of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s childhood books were divided between these two collections, the reputation of 
                                    <persName corresp="#ALB">Anna Letitia Barbauld</persName> had been disassociated from her politics and reduced to bland high&#x2010;mindedness&#x2014;a &#x201c;valuation&#x201d; 
                                    of this writing that suggests, as <persName corresp="#WMCCARTHY">William McCarthy</persName> complains, &#x201c;that it entirely lacked humor, irony, or wit&#x201d;

                                            While the copy has a <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName> bookplate&#x2014;type 2, a type that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself never used, as <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName> explains (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><title type="book" corresp="DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, xcvi&#x2013;xcvii)&#x2014;and while the copy contains

                                            That number of volumes is documented by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in a <title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_simpsonandco_1885-02-04"><date when="1885-02-04">4 February 1885</date> letter to <orgName corresp="#SIMPSONANDCO">Simpson &#x0026; Co.</orgName></title>, arranging to rebind three of the volumes remaining from his boyhood set, 
                                            emphasizing that his youthful markings were to be retained, and to number the volumes 1, 2, and 3, since he had &#x201C;lost the rest&#x201D; of the volumes (quoted in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, 8 [no. 34]). 
                                            The remaining volumes sent for binding would have been the original volumes 1, 2, and 5, with volumes 3, 4, and 6 gone missing,

                                            <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName> suggests that, since the <persName corresp="#FJS">Sharp</persName>/<persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> copy at the <placeName type="building" corresp="#BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke Library</placeName> &#x201C;is not bound in the style specified in the letter to <orgName corresp="#SIMPSONANDCO">Simpson &#x0026; Co.</orgName>&#x201D;, this volume

                                            This possibility is ruled out, however, since the <persName corresp="#FJS">Sharp</persName>/<persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> copy, which is a six&#x2010;volumes&#x2010;in&#x2010;one edition, complete in itself, cannot have formed a part of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s original set.<lb/><lb/>

                                            <persName corresp="#AFYFE">Aileen Fyfe</persName> explains that, <date notBefore="1792" notAfter="1823">from 1792 until 1823</date>, the text of the first edition was controlled by the first publisher, <persName corresp="#JJPUBLISHER">Joseph Johnson</persName>,

                                            a corrected and slightly expanded edition from <persName corresp="#JAIKIN">John Aikin</persName>&#x02BC;s son, <persName corresp="#AAIKIN">Arthur Aikin</persName>, which was published as the thirteenth edition, apparently in six volumes; 
                                            and in <date when="1826">1826</date>, an edition rearranged by <persName corresp="#JAIKIN">John Aikin</persName>&#x02BC;s daughter, <persName corresp="#LAIKIN">Lucy Aikin</persName>, was published in four volumes.

                                            The Ruskins would have entered the market for <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s initial copy of <title type="book" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title> 
                                            during the transitional period in the book&#x02BC;s publishing history, between the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1826">early&#x2010; and mid&#x2010;1820s</date>, when the Aikins were revising the text in order to extend copyright, 
                                            and when other publishers were issuing reprints of the first edition. At this point, the Ruskins would likely have acquired either the new edition of <date when="1823">1823</date> or afterward, 
                                            whose shareholder publishers included (since <date when="1815">1815</date>) <orgName corresp="#BALDWINCRADOCKANDJOY">Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy</orgName>, who also published the Ruskins&#x02BC; editions of <persName corresp="#ME">Maria Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="series" corresp="#EDGEWORTHEARLYLESSONS">&#x201C;Early Lessons&#x201D;</title> series; 
                                            or they would have purchased a first&#x2010;edition reprint available from non&#x2010;shareholder publishers. At that time, those non&#x2010;shareholder reprints 
                                            would not have included <persName corresp="#JFDOVE">Dove</persName>&#x02BC;s, since available evidence shows him coming late to the game. Consequently, putting aside the <persName corresp="#FJS">Sharp</persName>/<persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> <persName corresp="#JFDOVE">Dove</persName> edition&#x2014;undated, but probably after <date when="1827">1827</date>&#x2014;we 
                                            cannot determine what state of the text of <title type="book" corresp="#AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS"><hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi></title> was availble to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in his boyhood six&#x2010;volume version, whether the revised edition by <persName corresp="#AAIKIN">Arthur Aikin</persName> or the original descended from the <persName corresp="#JJPUBLISHER">Johnson</persName>/<orgName corresp="#RHUNTER">Hunter</orgName> shareholders (or even as originally published by <persName corresp="#JJPUBLISHER">Johnson</persName>/<orgName corresp="#RHUNTER">Hunter</orgName>). 
                                            A good bet may be the revised text of <date when="1823">1823</date>, since the shareholders carrying that text, including <orgName corresp="#BALDWINCRADOCKANDJOY">Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy</orgName>,produced substantial print runs that sold well 
                                                (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FYFECOPYRIGHTS"><persName corresp="#AFYFE">Fyfe</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#FYFECOPYRIGHTS">&#x201C;Copyrights and Competition&#x201D;</title></ref>, 43); and the Ruskins were familiar with <orgName corresp="#BALDWINCRADOCKANDJOY">Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy</orgName> 
                                                from their purchase of <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#EDGEWORTHFRANK"><hi rend="italic">Frank</hi></title> and <title type="book" corresp="#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><hi rend="italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</hi></title>. 
                                                Definitive evidence, however, must await recovery of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s three stray volumes, as rebound by <orgName corresp="#SIMPSONANDCO">Simpson</orgName>.<lb/><lb/>
                                            
                                            As for the <persName corresp="#FJS">Sharp</persName>/<persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> copy, since it contains annotations by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> from later years, a logical conclusion may be that he acquired this <persName corresp="#JFDOVE">Dove</persName> edition at some point to replace the lost volumes of his boyhood set, 
                                            at or before the time of sending the surviving copies for rebinding; or, if the <persName corresp="#JFDOVE">Dove</persName> reprint was a more youthful acquisition, it should be treated as an additional household copy, circa <date when="1830">1830</date>.

                    the hand of John James Ruskin; then, on a blank page which follows [i.e., the
