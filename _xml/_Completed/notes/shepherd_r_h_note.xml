                    compiled bibliographies of several other modern authors: <persName corresp="#CJHD">Dickens</persName> (<date when="1880">1880</date>),

                    Although little more than handlists, rather than descriptive or analytical bibliographies in a present&#x2010;day sense, 
                    <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> publications aspired to exhaustiveness, 
                    and his thoroughness led him to uncover early writing by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and others that was then little known.</p>

                <p>In addition to ferreting out modern authors&#x02BC; early work for bibliographical description, <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> edited a wide range of juvenilia and youthful writing for

                    which combines biographical narrative with extensive quotation in support of studying

                    Justifying the volume as preserving &#x201C;materials for such a study,&#x201D; materials that might otherwise be allowed to &#x201C;perish,&#x201D; <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> threads together commentary 
                    with liberal quotation from  <persName corresp="#ALT">Tennyson&#x02BC;s</persName> published early poetry, 
                    starting with <title type="collected_poems" corresp="#POEMSBYTWOBROTHERS"><hi rend="italic">Poems by Two Brothers</hi></title> (<date when="1827">1827</date>) and the <placeName corresp="#CAMBRIDGEU">Cambridge</placeName> prize poem (<date when="1829">1829</date>), and continuing with poetry associated with the death of 
                    <persName corresp="#AH">Arthur Hallam</persName> and with later poetry. In <date when="1870">1870</date> and again in <date when="1875">1875</date>, <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> 
                    printed <persName corresp="#ALT">Tennyson&#x02BC;s</persName>&#x02BC;s early <title type="poem" corresp="#TENNYSONLOVERS"><hi rend="italic">The Lover&#x02BC;s Tale</hi></title>, which the poet had suppressed. 
                    In <date when="1872">1872</date> (new ed., <date when="1878">1878</date>), he
                    reconstructed <persName corresp="#CLE">Charles</persName> and <persName corresp="#ML">Mary Lamb</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#LAMBSPOETRY"><hi rend="italic">Poetry for Children</hi></title>, and, in <date when="1878">1878</date>, <title type="book" corresp="#BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878"><hi rend="italic">The Earlier Poems of <persName corresp="#EBB">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</persName></hi></title>. 
                    In the latter, <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> typographically reproduced <persName corresp="#EBB">Barrett&#x02BC;s</persName> girlhood volume, <title type="book" corresp="#BARRETTBROWNINGANESSAYONMIND"><hi rend="italic">An Essay on Mind with Other Poems</hi></title> (<date when="1826">1826</date>), 
                    and he filled out the reprint with the miscellaneous poems found in <persName corresp="#EBB">Barrett&#x02BC;s</persName> <title type="book" corresp="#PROMETHEUSBOUNDANDMISC1833"><hi rend="italic">Prometheus Bound</hi></title> volume of <date when="1833">1833</date>. (<persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> 
                    believed that <title type="book" corresp="#BARRETTBROWNINGANESSAYONMIND"><hi rend="italic">An Essay on Mind</hi></title> was <persName corresp="#EBB">Barrett&#x02BC;s</persName> earliest published volume, whereas it was in fact preceded in

                    <title type="book" corresp="#PROMETHEUSBOUNDANDMISC1833"><hi rend="italic">Prometheus Bound . . . and Miscellaneous Poems</hi></title>.) 
                    Also in <date when="1878">1878</date>, <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> collected <title type="book" corresp="#HWLEARLYPOEMS"><hi rend="italic">The Early Poems of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</hi></title>, and he included <persName corresp="#TM">Moore&#x02BC;s</persName> juvenilia, along with a
                    number of later fugitive pieces in <title type="book" corresp="#MOOREPROSEANDVERSE"><hi rend="italic">Prose and Verse . . . by Thomas Moore</hi></title>. In <date when="1887">1887</date> came <persName corresp="#WMT">Thackeray&#x02BC;s</persName> turn, with recovery of <title type="book" corresp="#THACKERAYSULTANSTORK"><hi rend="italic">Sultan Stork</hi></title>
                    and other early sketches, which <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> included in a republication of his bibliography of the novelist.</p>
                <p>In <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName>&#x02BC;s facsimile editions of modern authors&#x02BC; works, the contents are dominated by juvenilia and youthful writing, 
                    doubtless owing in part to the appeal that the rarity of such items posed to collectors, and the opportunity that these scarce items afforded to a publishing market eager to serve collectors 
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.php">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</ref>). The

                    was irritated by <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> <title type="ana" corresp="#TENNYSONIANA"><hi rend="italic">Tennysoniana</hi></title> and in <date when="1866">1866</date> complained to 
                    the publisher, <persName corresp="#BMP">Basil Montagu</persName> that its publication was &#x201C;against my desire,&#x201D; having an &#x201C;infinite dislike to the 
                    sort of book about anyone&#x201D;; and he accused the book&#x02BC;s scholarship of inaccuracy (letter of <date when="1866-05-14">14 May 1866</date>,

                    Later, <persName corresp="#ALT">Tennyson</persName> drew the line when he learned that <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> 
                    had printed a transcript of the Laureate&#x02BC;s early poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#TENNYSONLOVERS"><hi rend="italic">The Lover&#x02BC;s Tale</hi></title> (composed <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1828">1827&#x2013;28</date>), 
                    in <date when="1870">1870</date> and again in <date when="1875">1875</date>. In 
                    <date notBefore="1875" notAfter="1876">1875&#x2013;76</date>, the poet adopted legal proceedings and won an injunction against

                    and some other poems, although, on learning that <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> was poor, <persName corresp="#ALT">Tennyson</persName> 
                    himself paid the court costs with which the defendant was charged 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PADENTENNYSONSHEPHERDWISE"><persName corresp="#WDP">Paden</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#PADENTENNYSONSHEPHERDWISE">&#x201C;Tennyson&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#TENNYSONLOVERS"><hi rend="italic">The Lover&#x02BC;s Tale </hi></title>, <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName>, and <persName corresp="#TJW">Wise</persName>,&#x201D;</title></ref>, 119&#x2013;24; 
                    as a legitimate publication, the text existed only as a scarce <date when="1833">1833</date> pamphlet, 
                    originally printed by the poet at his own expense and for private circulation only, 
                    <persName corresp="#ALT">Tennyson</persName> having decided to remove the poem from the manuscript of his <date when="1832">1832</date> <title type="book" corresp="#TENNYSON1832POEMS"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> published by <persName corresp="#EM">Edward Moxon</persName> [ibid., pp. 112&#x2013;13]).</p>
                <p>While <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> admitted his guilt and full responsibility for the <persName corresp="#ALT">Tennyson</persName> piracy, 
                    the episode points to a larger issue respecting the extent of writers&#x02BC; authority to control access to texts and their 
                    varying states versus collectors&#x02BC; desires to possess and study 
                    scarce publications, authorized or otherwise. In <persName corresp="#ALT">Tennyson&#x02BC;s</persName> case, his objections appear to have 
                    extended beyond a legitimate concern to protect an unpublished (if printed) poem 
                    to a belief that authorial control was absolute, that an author&#x02BC;s revision or 
                    suppression of a work obviated the public&#x02BC;s right to curiosity about 
                    previous states of that work. Even scholarly examination of his influences provoked the poet&#x02BC;s scorn and anxiety, as when he famously demeaned

                    Even if the literary value of a given early work seems doubtful, &#x201C;the study of [a poet&#x02BC;s] mind and work should be left to the scholar to decide, not to the poet&#x201D;

                    <persName corresp="#RB">Browning</persName> later acknowledged in court that he incited the journal&#x02BC;s attack on <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName>,

                    It must have been <persName corresp="#RB">Browning</persName>, however, who provided the journal with its key argument opposing the reprint&#x2014;namely, that 
                    <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> violated the wishes of the late poet, <persName corresp="#EBB">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</persName>, 
                    who had specifically suppressed the feature text of the proposed republication.

                    the journal strongly asserted an ethical opprobrium in <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> taking the &#x201C;liberty to defy the wishes of the dead, and to outrage the feelings of the living&#x201D;

                <p>In <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> reply to this charge, relayed by the <title type="periodical" corresp="ATHENAEUM"><hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi></title> in its <date when="1876-12">December 1876</date> issue, 
                    the editor conceded republication of the earlier Aeschylus translation. 
                    &#x201C;It was never my intention&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> declared&#x2014;surely disingenuously, as the journal remarked&#x2014;&#x201D;to reproduce the earlier draught of the 
                    version of the &#x2018;<title type="drama" corresp="#PROMETHEUSBOUND1833">Prometheus</title>&#x2019; (<date when="1833">1833</date>) for which a better and more mature

                    the <title type="drama" corresp="#JRPROMETHEUSBOUND1833"><hi rend="italic">Prometheus Bound</hi></title> translation. As already quoted, <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> claimed the authority of the scholar over that of the poet and the poet&#x02BC;s relations; and he persisted: 
                    &#x201C;The poems have been fully given to the world, and are now among the world&#x02BC;s possessions.
                    Poetical students will not allow them to die, however indifferent the general
                    public may be to them&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LITERARYGOSSIPDEC76">&#x201C;Mrs. Browning&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878">Earlier Poems</title>&#x201D;</ref>, 722). 
                    While the <title type="periodical" corresp="ATHENAEUM"><hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi></title> contested <persName corresp="#RHC">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> right to the shorter poems as well, 
                    and in the coming months repeatedly impugned his honesty, the journal was probably unjustified in attributing the editor&#x02BC;s motives solely to greed. 
                    In other instances, <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> was not timid about upholding the claims of scholarship against the mere assertion of power by literary men with intimidating reputations. 
                    For example, in the <date notBefore="1867" notAfter="1900">later nineteenth-century</date> revival of <persName corresp="#WBP">William Blake,</persName> <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> was unique among editors 
                    in his insistence on a &#x201C;historical&#x201D; (i.e., diplomatic) approach to the texts. In contrast, the Rossetti brothers, 
                    <persName corresp="#WMR">William Michael</persName> and <persName corresp="#DGR">Dante Gabriel,</persName> &#x201C;practiced emendation&#x201D; of <persName corresp="#WBP">Blake&#x02BC;s</persName> texts that amounted to wholesale rewriting. They made free with the texts in the belief 
                    that such an approach was justified by the view of <persName corresp="#WBP">Blake</persName> as vatic, heroic, and individualistic, 
                    a Carlylean representation of the poet advocated by the <persName corresp="#WBP">Blake</persName> biographer, <persName corresp="#AGB">Alexander Gilchrist</persName> (<date notBefore="1828" notAfter="1861">1828&#x2013;61</date>). 
                    In lonely opposition to this powerful current of opinion forming <persName corresp="#WBP">Blake&#x02BC;s</persName> reputation, <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> stood up for the integrity of the text over an assertion of control by any author, living or dead: 
                    &#x201C;<persName corresp="#DGR">Mr. [D. G.] Rossetti</persName> (though sanctioned by Mr. <persName corresp="#ACS">[Algernon] Swinburne</persName>) has no more right,&#x201D; <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> pronounced, 
                    &#x201C;to alter <persName corresp="#WBP">William Blake&#x02BC;s</persName> poems than <persName corresp="#JEM">Mr. [John Everett] Millais</persName> would have to paint out some obnoxious detail of medievalism in a work of Giotto or Cimabue&#x201D;&#x2014;<persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName>

                    justifies the omission in terms compliant with <persName corresp="#RB">Robert Browning&#x02BC;s</persName> objections&#x2014;namely, that 
                    the translation had been &#x201C;replaced by the authoress in later years by an entirely new version&#x201D;. To this admission, <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> adds the value judgment that 
                    &#x201C;to re&#x2010;produce the earlier crude attempt [at translation] or the girlish preface that 
                    accompanied it&#x201D; would not be &#x201C;wise or desirable&#x201D;. <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> thus entangles himself in contradiction, 
                    by referring to criteria of &#x201C;crudeness&#x201D; and &#x201C;girlishness&#x201D;, which justify suppression of some juvenilia, 
                    while declaring that the other selections from <title type="book" corresp="#PROMETHEUSBOUNDANDMISC1833"><hi rend="italic">Prometheus Bound . . . and Miscellaneous Poems</hi></title>, which he does reprint, 
                    are &#x201C;in no sense immature, or unworthy of the genius of the writer&#x201D;. At the same time, 
                    the introduction contains a passage nearly identical to one that, in his December <date when="1876">1876</date> reply to the <title type="periodical" corresp="ATHENAEUM"><hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi></title> a year earlier, <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> 
                    had pleaded in defense of the study of poets&#x02BC; youthful writing: 
                    &#x201C;The &#x2018;exquisite touch&#x2019; that &#x2018;bides in the birth of things&#x2019; is peculiarly apparent in the bursting of bud and leaf of a new poetic genius. 
                    The summer of its manifestation may have greater fervour, and richer pomp and majesty of foliage, but about its early spring there must always be a nameless and peculiar charm&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878"><title type="book" corresp="#BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878"><hi rend="italic">The Earlier Poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1833">1826&#x2013;1833</date></hi></title></ref>, vii&#x2013;viii;

                    in which <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> manifestly retained his faith, is consistent with his declarations elsewhere of a mission to make available the juvenile materials 
                    for studying the &#x201C;growth of a poet&#x02BC;s mind.&#x201D; According to the metaphor, these materials do not consist in Wordsworthian spots of time 
                    remembered from the youth&#x02BC;s experience of nature; rather, the metaphor figures the precocious child genius <hi rend="italic">as</hi> nature, 
                    and her or his early publications (or, presumably, manuscripts) as the material witness of this bursting into bud and leaf.</p>
                <p>In <date when="1877-12">December 1877</date>, the <title type="periodical" corresp="ATHENAEUM"><hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi></title> carried a review of the <persName corresp="#EBB">Barrett Browning</persName> reprint. 
                    The writer has been identified as <persName corresp="#TWD">Theodore Watts&#x2010;Dunton</persName> (<date notBefore="1832" notAfter="1914">1832&#x2013;1914</date>;

                    In the review, <persName corresp="#TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</persName> tasks <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> as a &#x201C;bookseller&#x02BC;s hack&#x201D; who, &#x201C;devoid&#x201D; of &#x201C;literary taste,&#x201D; 
                    &#x201C;must be called a bibliographer, . . . by dint of that enormous patience which often accompanies a dearth of intelligence&#x201D;, 
                    and which makes him &#x201C;really learned in editions and in variations of texts&#x201D;

                    This contempt for the editor of reprinted early works and compiler of &#x201C;variations of texts&#x201D;,&#x2014;a sneer detectable in the tone even of 
                    <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> newspaper obituary, which pronounced him &#x201C;a great authority upon the various editions, with their additions and emendations, of the works&#x201D;

                    As a solicitor, <persName corresp="#TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</persName> would have been interested in questions of copyright raised by the reprint.

                    <persName corresp="#TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</persName> would have been in a position to advise the journal, having joined the <title type="periodical" corresp="ATHENAEUM"><hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi></title> staff only months earlier, in <date when="1876-07">July 1876</date>

                    Questions of copyright aside, <persName corresp="#TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</persName> uses a figure comparing <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> to an &#x201C;insect&#x201D;, which echoes a characterization by <persName corresp="#WMR">William Michael Rossetti</persName>, 
                    and which suggests that the animus of these men arose less from outrage over legal violation 
                    than from their indignation over what they perceived as <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> loss of professional caste. <persName corresp="#WMR">Rossetti</persName> characterizes <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> as a &#x201C;vampire,&#x201D; 
                    the figure suggesting a parasitical feeding on the corpus of the author. The contempt appears to center in a perception of the reprint editor as violating the author&#x02BC;s integrity and possession of self. 
                    What&#x02BC;s worse, the reprint editor poses a particularly degrading, subordinate form of parasitical exploitation, since the editor works for a publisher.

                    &#x201C;To be one&#x02BC;s own vampire is an unenviable lot; to be somebody else&#x02BC;s vampire is a post to which only a torturous ambition could aspire&#x201D;. 
                    In another of <persName corresp="#WMR">Rossetti&#x02BC;s</persName> stretched analogies, the reprint editor combines the role of the &#x201C;chiffonier&#x201D; (i.e., ragpicker) with that of the &#x201C;resurrection-man&#x201D; (i.e., body snatcher)

                <p>In the hands of <persName corresp="#TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton,</persName> this characterization of Shepherd&#x02BC;s offense both descends into scurrilous abuse and is elevated to a challenge to Britain&#x02BC;s national interests. 
                    If <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> professed mission, according to his <date when="1876">1876</date> reply to the <title type="periodical" corresp="ATHENAEUM"><hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi></title>,

                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LITERARYGOSSIPDEC76">&#x201C;Mrs. Browning&#x02BC;s Earlier Poems&#x201D;,</ref> 722), 
                    then the nation&#x02BC;s interests demand that the editor of modern authors&#x02BC; juvenilia and other &#x201C;literary revivals&#x201D; be put down. Exposed as a &#x201C;vampire&#x201D; and blood&#x2010;sucking &#x201C;insect,&#x201D; 
                    he must be denied autonomy, lest he exercise critical and creative authority over the writer, the writer&#x02BC;s family, and the nation. 
                    Thus, <persName corresp="#TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton,</persName> apparently perceived his mission in the review as ostracizing <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd,</persName> separating him from the &#x201C;noble calling&#x201D; of legitimate commerce with men of genius. 
                    The reprint editor is relegated to the fringe of professional letters as a mere scavenger; 
                    such a person &#x201C;scans the book-stalls&#x201D; for &#x201C;some forgotten production, or some inchoate form of a known production of a famous writer,&#x201D; 
                    and then attaches himself to a publisher or bookseller willing to abandon &#x201C;the dignity of a noble calling&#x201D; 
                    (&#x201C;we wish to express our astonishment and regret that publishers <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be found for such undertakings as this [reprint of Barrett juvenilia] and ‘<title type="ana" corresp="#TENNYSONIANA">Tennysoniana</title>’&#x201C;). 
                    Such a pair as this fallen publisher and his hack, advancing the &#x201C;precocious smartness&#x201D; of juvenilia in place of poetic genius, deserves the contempt of the &#x201C;man of genius&#x201D; 
                    (and even the &#x201C;typical woman of poetic genius&#x201D;). Any respectable author who is &#x201C;about to print&#x201D; and embody his genius in a printed book will do well to 
                    &#x201C;pause and consider before he imperils his privileges as an English gentleman&#x201D; by succumbing to &#x201C;caterers of this kind&#x201D;

                    <persName corresp="#RB">Browning</persName> was casting a net beyond even the contested shorter poems in the <date when="1833">1833</date> <title type="book" corresp="#PROMETHEUSBOUNDANDMISC1833"><hi rend="italic">Prometheus</hi></title> volume, to guard the entirety of <persName corresp="#EBB">Barrett&#x02BC;s</persName> juvenilia,

                    Therefore, <persName corresp="#RB">Browning</persName> urged,

                <p>Awkwardly for <persName corresp="#EBB">Browning</persName>, as <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> lawyer pointed out, 
                    <persName corresp="#RB">Browning</persName> had acted seemingly analogously to <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName>

                    for which <persName corresp="#RB">Browning</persName> penned an introduction. 
                    Interestingly, <persName corresp="#RB">Browning</persName> anticipated the comparison, and even offered to read aloud the entire essay, which he had brought with him to court&#x2014;an offer 
                    that was deflected with laughter. (<persName corresp="#RB">Browning</persName>&#x02BC;s proposal seems less absurd when one realizes that, in <date when="1879">1879,</date> only a few privileged collectors had access to the introduction,

                    and it became known by its now familiar title, the <hi rend="italic">Essay on Shelley</hi>.

                    In the end <persName corresp="#RB">Browning</persName> seems 
                    only to have helped the plaintiff&#x02BC;s case by admitting not only that he failed to seek the permission of <persName corresp="#PBS">Shelley&#x02BC;s</persName> living descendant before publishing the introduction, 
                    but that he had even recognized the <persName corresp="#PBS">Shelley</persName> letters as forgeries when he undertook the project

                <p>For <persName corresp="#RB">Browning</persName> scholars, the more significant issue presented by this episode is <persName corresp="#RB">Browning&#x02BC;s</persName> confounding admission that he was aware that 
                    <persName corresp="#EM">Moxon&#x02BC;s</persName> edition consisted of forgeries of <persName corresp="#PBS">Shelley&#x02BC;s</persName> letters, 
                    a testimony that scholars have attempted to explain in a more flattering light consistent with the poet&#x02BC;s character. What is more to our purpose is the remark with which the rattled poet sought 
                    to redirect the cross&#x2010;examination to his principle point in having carried the <title type="essay" corresp="#BROWNINGESSAYONSHELLEY"><hi rend="italic">Essay on Shelley</hi></title> into court. As <persName corresp="#RB">Browning</persName> explained: 
                    &#x201C;&#x2018;My essay was on the character of <persName corresp="#PBS">Shelley</persName>, 
                    and I referred to these poems [e.g., &#x201C;Queen Mab&#x201D;] as those of an immature boyhood&#x201D;&#x2019;

                    For <persName corresp="#RB">Browning</persName>, the immaturity of the poet settles the debate a priori respecting the value of the poems, 
                    just as <persName corresp="#TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</persName> in his review of <title type="book" corresp="#BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878"><hi rend="italic">The Earlier Poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning</hi></title> appeals to the &#x201C;common&#x2010;sense&#x201D; of the &#x201C;judicious . . . British public&#x201D; 
                    in settling judgments of literary value of works that are likely to benefit the nation

                    By these &#x201C;common-sense&#x201D; standards, the poet maintains perpetual right over what&#x02BC;s in and what&#x02BC;s out, and <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> claims for the independent judgment of the critic are nowhere. 
                    The <title type="periodical" corresp="ATHENAEUM"><hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi></title> incessantly reminded readers of a phrase tossed off by <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> in his <date when="1876">1876</date> reply to journal,

                    <persName corresp="#TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</persName> scoffed at a conception of the study of poetry that indulges &#x201C;&#x2018;<hi rend="italic">caviare</hi>&#x2019; at the expense of all the common amenities of life&#x201D;

                <p>In taking this common&#x2010;sense stance, <persName corresp="#RB">Browning</persName> avoided the implications of <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> cheeky quotation of the poet himself, when arguing for the value of early writing. 
                    As testimonial to the &#x201C;nameless and peculiar charm&#x201D; to be discovered the &#x201C;bursting of bud and leaf of a new poetic genius,&#x201D; 
                    <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> quotes <persName corresp="#RB">Browning</persName> on the &#x201C;&#x2018;exquisite touch&#x2019; that &#x2018;bides in the birth of things&#x2019;&#x201D;, a line from

                    I have argued elsewhere that <persName corresp="#RB">Browning</persName> did eventually answer <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> more thoughtfully about his opponent&#x02BC;s appropriation from this poem, 
                    which meditates on how the poetic spirit engages with the material world.<!-- citation when known --> Here it is necessary to drive at the main point concerning the reception of <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> poetics, 
                    which defended the value of a poet&#x02BC;s juvenile writing in understanding the growth of the modern poet&#x02BC;s mind&#x2014;albeit a poetics ever so slightly developed in <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> writing. 
                    Although the Wordsworthian tropes making up this hypothesis would have been more than familiar to every cultivated British reader by mid&#x2010;century, 
                    <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> proposition of taking juvenilia seriously in the study of modern poetry provoked a furious reaction from the <title type="periodical" corresp="ATHENAEUM"><hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi></title> that demands understanding.</p>
                <p>Part of the disturbance appears owing to the recognition that, as already pointed out, <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> formulation is not quite Wordsworthian, in that the child&#x02BC;s genius is not remembered and translated 
                    through the poet&#x02BC;s mature inscription of spots of time, but rather directly communicated to the observer by the child writer. 
                    In the <title type="periodical" corresp="ATHENAEUM"><hi rend="italic">Athenaeum&#x02BC;s</hi></title> review of <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> edition of the <persName corresp="#ML">Lamb</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#LAMBSPOETRY"><hi rend="italic">Poetry for Children</hi></title>, 
                    the writer dwells on <persName corresp="#WW">Wordsworth&#x02BC;s</persName> paradigm of loss, which forms the &#x201C;inexplicable&#x201D; 
                    but &#x201C;impassable gulf&#x201D; between &#x201C;the adult mind and the mind of childhood&#x201D;: &#x201C;If it 
                    was by a sudden leap that we left behind us the &#x2018;heaven&#x2019; that &#x2018;lies about us in 
                    our infancy&#x2019;&#x2014;if we lost at one stoke all that sense of the wonderfulness of the 
                    wonderful, the beauty of the beautiful&#x2014;all that intense belief in the 
                    personality of natural forces, all that close and tender intimacy with the lower 
                    animals, which go to make up that &#x2018;heaven&#x2019;&#x2014;the existence of the world of dull 
                    dead darkness which has supplanted it would not be so inscrutable.&#x201D; But despite the writer&#x02BC;s mournfulness over the defectiveness of the adult mind that 
                    &#x201C;it is [only] from without, and not from within, that . . . those landscapes of childhood&#x201D; are perceptible, and despite his Dickensian tirade against the modern 
                    &#x201C;stupid system of so&#x2010;called education&#x201D; that deadens us by trampling on &#x201C;the limitless 
                    potentialities of happiness in children,&#x201D; it is clear that the writer is unwilling to relinquish the paradigm of loss of childhood, since it sponsors <persName corresp="#WW">Wordsworth</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    paradigm of recompense. The reviewer is consoled that the imaginative experience of literature in childhood forms an inalienable part of the psychological and spiritual self, 
                    because this formation is overseen by a Wordsworthian &#x201C;literature of power&#x201D; that insists on the child&#x02BC;s subordination: 
                    &#x201C;[I]t is impossible to calculate how enormous in moulding the mind is the power of infant literature. 
                    It is not merely that what we read in childhood we never forget, but that it becomes part of our very being.&#x201D; &#x201C;Infant literature&#x201D; means writing <hi rend="italic">for</hi> children by adults, 
                    not writing <hi rend="italic">by</hi> children. The formation of the self, &#x201C;our very being,&#x201D; depends on a &#x201C;literature of power&#x201D; that guides but silences the child

                <p>To <persName corresp="#TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton,</persName> the &#x201C;inscrutable&#x201D; imagination of the child, that &#x201C;nameless and peculiar charm,&#x201D; is likely to produce only &#x201C;precocious smartness,&#x201D; if confronted directly in a child&#x02BC;s writing, 
                    and so he anathematizes the monstrosity of the precocious child writer in his review of <persName corresp="#EBB">Barrett Browning&#x02BC;s</persName> juvenilia. 
                    He does, however, maintain a circumscribed place of sentiment for the dead child writer of promise,

                    of the hot enthusiasms of youth&#x201D;, and if the impulse &#x201C;is long kept in check by adverse circumstances, the interests of the world come thicker and thicker, till, at last, that energy which&#x2014;had 
                    the printing difficulty been early overcome&#x2014;would have expressed itself in literature, is exhausted in other channels&#x201D;

                    <persName corresp="#TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton&#x02BC;s</persName> example of the child writer extinguished by circumstance is the erstwhile poet, <persName corresp="#CJW">Charles Jeremiah Wells</persName>, 
                    around whom the Pre&#x2010;Raphaelite circle had been constructing a myth of the neglected poet. In <date when="1875">1875</date>, <persName corresp="#ACS">Swinburne</persName> published an appreciation of <persName corresp="#CJW">Wells</persName>, 
                    in which he presents the writer&#x02BC;s first publication, the <hi rend="italic">Stories after Nature</hi> (<date when="1822">1822</date>) as neglected juvenilia, &#x201C;written it is said in his earliest youth&#x201D;, 
                    although in fact <persName corresp="#CJW">Wells</persName> published the stories in his early twenties. <persName corresp="#ACS">Swinburne</persName> characterizes the child author of the stories in terms 
                    similar to <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> figuration of the child writer as an enigma of nature: &#x201C;The first publication of <persName corresp="#CJW">Mr. Wells</persName> . . . has much of the charm 
                    and something of the weakness natural to the first flight and the first note of a song&#x2010;bird, whose wings have yet to grow, and whose notes have yet to deepen; 
                    yet in its first flutterings and twitterings there is a nameless grace, a beauty indefinable, which belongs only to the infancy of genius as it belongs only to the infancy of life&#x201D;

                <p>Unlike the <title type="periodical" corresp="ATHENAEUM"><hi rend="italic">Athenaeum&#x02BC;s</hi></title> reviewer of the Lambs&#x02BC; <title type="book" corresp="#LAMBSPOETRY"><hi rend="italic">Poetry for Children</hi></title>, <persName corresp="#ACS">Swinburne</persName> is willing to imagine the effect of 
                    imaginative writing by a child writer on the &#x201C;a reader of the age at which this book was written&#x201D;, 
                    and he seems to quote himself as just such a youthful reader moved by the impressive effect of these stories. 
                    (Although this review was published in <date when="1876">1876</date>, <persName corresp="#ACS">Swinburne</persName> first submitted a version, unsuccessfully, to <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x02BC;s Magazine</hi> in 1861; 
                    and his initial introduction to <persName corresp="#CJW">Wells</persName>&#x02BC;s writing probably dated from as early as <date when="1857">1857</date>, when he turned twenty and met <persName corresp="#DGR">D. G. Rossetti</persName>. 
                    Since <date when="1849">1849</date>, during the initial formation of the <orgName corresp="#PRB">Pre&#x2010;Raphaelite Brotherhood</orgName>, <persName corresp="#DGR">Rossetti</persName> had urged the members to regard <persName corresp="#CJW">Wells</persName>&#x02BC;s obscure closet drama, <hi rend="italic">Joseph and His Brethren</hi> [<date when="1824">1824</date>], 
                    as a talismanic text, and <persName corresp="#DGR">Rossetti</persName> persisted in championing <persName corresp="#CJW">Wells</persName> through the <date notBefore="1860" notAfter="1869">1860s,</date> 
                    but dropped the cause in the <date notBefore="1870" notAfter="1879">1870s</date>, when <persName corresp="#ACS">Swinburne</persName>, with whom <persName corresp="#DGR">Rossetti</persName> had quarreled, at last succeeded along with <persName corresp="#TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</persName> and others in getting the play published 
                    [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BUTLERSHIBBOLETH">Butler, &#x201C;Pre&#x2010;Raphaelite Shibboleth&#x201D;</ref>, 78, 82&#x2013;84].) 
                    <persName corresp="#ACS">Swinburne</persName>&#x02BC;s alleged youthful response is scarcely suggestive, however, of an infant connection with a &#x201C;nameless&#x201D; and &#x201C;indefinable&#x201D; beauty that can belong &#x201C;only to the infancy of genius&#x201D;. 
                    While <persName corresp="#ACS">Swinburne</persName> says his youthful self found the <hi rend="italic">Stories from Nature</hi> &#x201C;&#x2018;perfect in grace and power, tender and exquisite in choice of language&#x2019;&#x201D;, his early response also emphasized the stories&#x02BC; 
                    &#x201C;&#x2018;noble and masculine delicacy in feeling and purpose&#x2019;&#x201D;. The adult <persName corresp="#ACS">Swinburne</persName> demurs over his early enthusiasm for this boyish but masculine writing, 
                    now demanding that a child reader of <persName corresp="#CJW">Wells</persName>&#x02BC;s stories, &#x201C;if there be in him any critical judgment or any promise of such faculty to come,&#x201D; discover that the stories &#x201C;relish of a bastard graft&#x201D;.

                    the stories betray excesses of overwrought poetic prose and the influence of <persName corresp="#JHLH">Leigh Hunt</persName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SWINBURNEUNKNOWNPOET"><persName corresp="#ACS">Swinburne</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#SWINBURNUNKNOWNPOET">&#x201C;An Unknown Poet&#x201D;</title></ref>, 218).</p>
                <p>Just so, <persName corresp="#TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</persName> is alarmed by the possibilities opened up by imagining a Wordsworthian child of joy gaining access to a printer before the shades of the prison&#x2010;house can close in upon him. 
                    The only benefit of early publication, <persName corresp="#TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</persName> decides, is to act as &#x201C;a sort of safety&#x2010;valve or &#x2018;air&#x2010;hole,&#x2019; 
                    from which escapes, to the great good of the producer, the balderdash engendered, like a bad gas, by the active forces of youth.&#x201D; 
                    The child writer, instead of trailing clouds of glory, emits fatuous imagination&#x2014;the advantage of such flights being that, in an age of steam, 
                    early printing at least allows for regulation of the excess energy, as in an engine. 
                    For according to the &#x201C;economy of Nature&#x201D; in an industrial age, when poets can begin publishing at age fourteen, &#x201C;the more genius there is in any youthful brain 
                    the more nonsense&#x201D; there is to be &#x201C;got rid of&#x201D;; and as an additional benefit to the nation, early printing purges the child writer&#x02BC;s impressionable imitations of others. 
                    Just as <persName corresp="#ACS">Swinburne&#x02BC;s</persName> infant critic recognizes, &#x201C;on taking up the little book [by <persName corresp="#CJW">Wells</persName>] again in after years,&#x201D; the undue &#x201C;perceptible influence of <persName corresp="#JHLH">Leigh Hunt</persName>,&#x201D; so 
                    <persName corresp="#TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton,</persName> finds belabored in child writing &#x201C;the quintessential amalgam of the literary vices of many predecessors.&#x201D; 
                    The proper &#x201C;education of the poet consists not in learning, but in unlearning,&#x201D; he pronounces; 
                    and early printing at least enables the nation&#x02BC;s youthful writers to unlearn all the sooner, just as the previous generation needed to rid itself of 
                    &#x201C;the concentrated essence of the sentimentality and fustian which infested the literary atmosphere of this country
