                <p>In a <date when="1903">1903</date> essay, <title type="essay" corresp="WGCRUSKINSHAND">&#x201C;Ruskin&#x02BC;s Hand&#x201D;</title>, 
                    <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> claims that, in childhood, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                    &#x201c;developed his own writing like other precocious boys and girls, though there is some trace of teaching at the very start&#x201d;; 
                    and then later, &#x201c;after <date when="1830">1830</date>, he exchanged, perhaps at the instance of superior orders, his &#x2018;print&#x2019; 
                    for copperplate&#x201d;, imitating his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName>&#x02BC;s mercantile round hand with the aid of a copybook 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WGCRUSKINSHAND"><title type="essay" corresp="WGCRUSKINSHAND">&#x201C;Ruskin&#x02BC;s Hand&#x201D;</title>, <title type="periodical" corresp="#GOODWORDS"><hi rend="italic">Good Words</hi></title></ref>, 652;

                    Seemingly the most untenable assumption in <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02bc;s account is the exclusion of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s mother from any role in his developing handwriting, 
                    by limiting the story to the boy&#x02bc;s precocity and his father&#x02bc;s masculine mercantile discipline. 
                    Obviously, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> presided over the scenes of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s writing 
                    during <persName corresp="#JR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s frequent absences on business trips.</p>
                    <!--START MARKUP-->
                    <p>Yet, in the family letters, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> does tend absent herself from reports of 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s progress in handwriting, as if he simply performed these feats unaided&#x2014;like 
                        a creature in nature prodding itself to walk upright. On <date when="1823-03-15">15 March 1823</date>, when <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> transcribed &#x201C;exactly word for word&#x201D; what 
                        the four year old &#x201C;said was a letter to send to&#x201D; his father and &#x201C;pretended to read from his paper&#x201D; on which he had &#x201C;been very busy 
                        scrawling with a pencil&#x201D;&#x2014;<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;first letter&#x201D;, as it has been called&#x2014;Margaret remarked &#x201C;he is beginning to copy from his books 
                        and will soon learn himself to write I think&#x201D; (Ruskin Family Letters, ed. Burd, 128; and see 
                        Hanson, &#x201C;Materiality in John Ruskin&#x02BC;s Early Letters and Dialogues&#x201D;, 5&#x2013;7). While it seems unlikely that Margaret provided John with no direction whatever 
                        when &#x201C;learn[ing] himself to write&#x201D;, evidence of his &#x201C;copy[ing] from his books&#x201D; as a possible auto&#x2010;didactic practice 
                        does survive in his copy of The History of Little Jack by Thomas Day 
                        (Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Physical Descriptions&#x2014;Books Held by The Ruskin).
                        Throughout the book, Ruskin traced the outlines of the woodcut illustrations on the blank reverse of those pages 
                        (omitting to outline only the illustration of Little Jack fighting with another boy), and on one page he has copied words.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the text of Little Jack, Day imagines a scene of writing instruction, given the limited resources available to the hero in his youth 
                        and his impoverished adoptive father, the old man:</p>

                                <p>But the old man, as he was something of a scholar, had a great ambition that his darling
                                    should learn to read and write: and this was a work of some difficulty; for he had neither 
                                    printed book, nor pens, nor paper, in his cabin. Industry, however, enables us to overcome difficulties: 
                                    in the summer&#x2010;time, as the old man sat before his cottage, he would draw letters in the sand, 
                                    and teach Jack to name them singly, until he was acquainted with the whole alphabet. 
                                    He then proceeded to syllables, and after that to words; all which his little pupil learned 
                                    to pronounce with great facility: and, as he had a strong propensity to imitate what he saw, 
                                    he not only acquired the power of reading words, but of tracing all the letters 
                                    which composed them on the sand.</p>

                    <p>In Ruskin&#x02BC;s copy of the book, the outlines of the woodcuts testify to his sharing Little Jack&#x02BC;s &#x201C;strong propensity to imitate what he saw&#x201D;, while scattered, penciled words in Ruskin&#x02BC;s hand on a flyleaf 
                        may be artifacts of his &#x201C;learn[ing] himself to write&#x201D; by imitation, as well. (Some of the barely legible, smeared words&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">arrived</hi>, <hi rend="italic">preserve</hi>&#x2014;can be found in the printed text.) 
                        Ruskin can scarcely have relied solely on himself, however, for the old man&#x02BC;s method of progressing from alphabet to syllables to words. 
                        Words written in ink by both Margaret and Jahn James are found in the book as well.</p>
                    
                    <p>Prior to this writing instruction and practice circa 1823, Ruskin was already able to print his name in pencil. 
                        In her 15 March 1823 letter containing her transcription of John&#x02BC;s so&#x2010;called <hi rend="italic">first letter</hi>, 
                        Margaret pointed out to John James that &#x201C;the signature you will see is his own&#x201D;, although &#x201C;sometimes he makes the letters much better&#x201D; 
                        (Ruskin Family Letters, ed. Burd, 128). Also, in Ruskin&#x02BC;s copy of Frank: A Sequel to Frank in Early Lessons by Maria Edgeworth 
                        (Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Physical Descriptions&#x2014;Books Held by the Beinecke Library), a flyleaf of volume 1 holds 
                        a signature in pencil that appears to be in an unsure, albeit undateable hand (see 
                        Viljoen, Ruskin&#x02BC;s Backgrounds, Friendships, and Interests, 6 [item 2]). Helen Viljoen&#x02BC;s notion is fanciful 
                        that Ruskin&#x02BC;s earliest surviving signature can be detected in a scrawl that forms a vague shape like a <hi rend="italic">J</hi>, 
                        an improbable interpretation since the scrawl is found in a copy of Evenings at Home by John Aikin and Letitia Barbauld 
                        which is very likely not a boyhood copy (Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Physical Descriptions&#x2014;Books Held by the Beinecke Library). </p>

                        he wrote entirely in print lettering. The medium is graphite, for which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would have used either a porte&#x2010;crayon&#x2014;a metal holder for rods of plumbago&#x2014;or 
                        a cedar pencil. (In <ref type="witness" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_msi.php#PENCILS"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201c;Harry and Lucy . . .

                        The plumbago used in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> was proudly mined in <placeName corresp="#BORROWDALE">Borrowdale</placeName>,

                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> forms his characters very large in this earliest extant pencil lettering, as well as in his earliest pen&#x2010;and&#x2010;ink lettering (e.g., in portions of <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref>), 
                        and he allows ample interlinear space&#x2014;the line spacing owing in part to his following the pre&#x2010;ruled lines in the stationer&#x02bc;s notebooks known in the family as the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title></ref>. 
                        A model for his large, well&#x2010;formed lettering may have lain&#x2014;not in a copybook, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears to have encountered later&#x2014;but in typography. 
                        In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, a precedent for typography in children&#x02bc;s books had been set by 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="barbauld_anna_laetitia_note.php"><persName corresp="#ALB">Anna Letitia Barbauld</persName></ref>&#x02bc;s

                        in which she advocated for printing children&#x02bc;s books in large font size along with generous allowance of white space on the page, 
                        in order to make print accessible and legible to a child&#x02bc;s eyes. As <persName corresp="#ALB">Barbauld</persName> explains in the preface, 
                        a &#x201c;great defect&#x201d; she found in books commonly produced for children was &#x201c;the want of <hi rend="italic">good paper, a clear and large type</hi>, 
                        and <hi rend="italic">large spaces</hi>. They only, who have actually taught young children, can be sensible how necessary 
                        these assistances are&#x201d; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BARBAULDLESSONS"><persName corresp="#ALB">Barbauld</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#BARBAULDLESSONS"><hi rend="italic">Lessons for Children</hi></title></ref>, 3&#x2013;4; and see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MCCARTHYBARBAULDLESSONS"><persName corresp="#WMCCARTHY">McCarthy</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#MCCARTHYBARBAULDLESSONS">&#x201c;Mother of All Discourses&#x201d;</title></ref>, 200&#x2013;201).

                    <p>At the same time, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s pencil print lettering already shows signs of being modeled on favorite books that were not intended for small children. For example, in

                        he imitated the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="edgeworth_harry_and_lucy_concluded_note.php">original&#x02BC;s title page</ref>; and in the text, he may have modeled his letters on the serif typeface used for <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        <date when="1825">1825</date> book, even adopting a decorative capital <hi rend="italic">Y</hi> from the display type of the title page. 
                        (The lettering suggests Caslon or perhaps the English transitional serif typefaces, such as Baskerville and Bulmer, 
                        which predominated in British books of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.) Another influential model was the <title type="series" corresp="#DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">&#x201C;Dove&#x02BC;s English Classics&#x201D;</title>, 
                        a reprint series of which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> owned volumes of <persName corresp="#APOPE">Pope</persName>&#x02BC;s translation of the <title type="poem" corresp="#HOMERILIAD"><hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi></title> (<date when="1824">1824</date>) 
                        and of <persName corresp="#JDRYDEN">Dryden</persName>&#x02BC;s translation of the <title type="poem" corresp="#VIRGILAENEID"><hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi></title> and other works (<date when="1825">1825</date>) by <persName corresp="#VIRGIL">Virgil</persName>. 
                        At three by five inches, much smaller than the <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName> volumes, 
                        the <title type="series" corresp="#DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">&#x201C;Dove&#x02BC;s English Classics&#x201D;</title> were comparable in size to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title></ref>, 
                        but typographically the text was the opposite of <persName corresp="#ALB">Barbauld</persName>&#x02bc;s child&#x2010;friendly large and spacious type. 
                        The densely set lines of verse on small pages resulted in many runovers, which the printer/publisher <orgName corresp="#JFDOVEPUB">J. F. Dove</orgName> managed with a device that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> precisely imitated 
                        when his own poems crowded the margins of his <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title></ref> 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="boyhood_books_note.php#DESCRIPTIONS">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Physical Descriptions</ref>;

                    <p>Another typographic feature that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> adopted to ornament his printed lettering 
                        was a decorative capital that he called &#x201C;double&#x201D; print. This was formed with a doubled downward or upward stroke, which could be left open or filled wtih shadow. 
                        Examples occur in the earliest fair&#x2010;copy manuscripts, both in the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref> and in the separate 
                        presentation copies of poems that were later bound in <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title></ref> and 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title></ref> 
                        (see, e.g., the <date when="1827-01-01">1 January 1827</date> pencil presentation copy, <ref type="witness" target="time_blank_verse_msia.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTIMEBLANKVERSE">&#x201C;Papa whats time a figure or a sense&#x201D;</title></ref>). 
                        Possible models for the &#x201C;double&#x2010;lettering&#x201D; include a display typeface used on title pages of <title type="series" corresp="#DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">&#x201C;Dove&#x02BC;s English Classics&#x201D;</title> 
                        and a similar engraved lettering used on maps in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s geography book, 
                        <title type="book" corresp="#GOLDSMITHGEOGRAPHY"><hi rend="italic">Geography Illustrated on a Popular Plan</hi></title> (<date when="1820">1820</date>) by the <persName corresp="#RJG">Reverend J. Goldsmith</persName>&#x2014;the 
                        author also of a geography text used by the <orgName corresp="#BRONTES">Bront&#x00EB;s</orgName> 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 35:79;

                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears to have derived his double&#x2010;lettering primarily from a serif model, 
                        but he may also have based it on the sanserif typefaces that began as a neoclassical revival in the <date notBefore="1780" notAfter="1789">1780s</date> 
                        and sprang into a variety of forms and associations in the first decades of the nineteenth century 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CRAMSIEGRAPHIC"><persName corresp="#PCRAMSIE">Cramsie</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#CRAMSIEGRAPHIC"><hi rend="italic">Story of Graphic Design</hi></title></ref>, 117&#x2013;18, 126&#x2013;27). 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> used these decorative printed letter forms until <date notBefore="1828" notAfter="1829">1828&#x2013;29</date>, when his lettering for many texts 
                        became notably smaller, though no less typographical in form&#x2014;the decrease in size perhaps owing to his increasing agility with pen and ink, which he was using by then, but perhaps also to imitating the smaller type in the adult books 
                        he was consuming by then.</p>
                    
                    <p>Examples of earlier, less accomplished print lettering by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> survive (see, e.g., the signature to his so&#x2010;called first letter, 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="jr_and_mr_to_jjr_1823-03-15_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="#jr_and_mr_to_jjr_1823-03-15">John Ruskin and Margaret Ruskin to John James Ruskin, 15 March 1823</title></ref>), 
                        but the first substantive corpus of juvenilia, which starts in <date when="1826">1826</date>, is so consistently and even obsessively well&#x2010;formed in its lettering that the showmanship drew worried comment from <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>. 
                        In a study of writing instruction in colonial <placeName corresp="#USA">America</placeName>, <persName corresp="#EJMONAGHAN">E. Jennifer Monaghan</persName> notes the disjunction between the point of the writing master&#x02bc;s exercises&#x2014;which was 
                        focused on &#x201c;form&#x201d; and the &#x201c;purely visual properties&#x201d; of handwriting, thus requiring the student &#x201c;to learn 
                        how to represent the words of others&#x201d; in &#x201c;a variety of scripts&#x201d;&#x2014;and the ultimate purpose of writing instruction, 
                        which was to teach &#x201c;a child to express himself&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EJMONAGHANLEARNING"><hi rend="italic">Learning to Read and Write in Colonial America</hi></ref>, 275). 
                        <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> turned the writing master&#x02bc;s approach on its head, asking her husband to &#x201c;excuse&#x201d; how <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02bc;s &#x201c;showing you&#x201d; the mechanical skill of &#x201c;his writing 
                        occupied his thoughts fully more than how he expressed his feelings&#x201d; (<ref type="apparatus" target="mr_to_jjr_1827-04-28_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="mr_to_jjr_1827-04-28">Margaret to John James Ruskin, <date when="1827-04-28">28 April 1827</date></title></ref>

                        From the perspective of the nineteenth&#x2010;century child writer, however, what seems a deflection into pedantry may have been a source of empowerment. 
                        Copying a text skillfully sponsored agency, as the seven&#x2010;year&#x2010;old <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> asserted on the title page of 
                        <ref type="witness" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_msi.php"><title type="book" corresp="#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED">&#x201c;Harry and Lucy Concluded, Being the Last Part of Early Lessons, in Four Volumes, Vol 1&#x201d;</title></ref>: 
                        the work, according to its author, was &#x201c;<hi rend="smallcaps">PRINTED</hi> and composed by a little boy &#x007C; and also drawn&#x201d;.</p>
                    
                    <p>From the present&#x2010;day reader&#x02BC;s standpoint, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s juvenilia is most interesting 
                        when, rather than straightforwardly copying <persName corresp="#ME">Maria Edgeworth</persName>&#x02bc;s dialogues, he adapts the genre to depicting daily life at <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName>. 
                        We are apt to regard it as a failure of inspiration when he reproduces verbatim the text of experiments from <persName corresp="#JJ">Jeremiah Joyce</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="book" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></title>. 
                        However, as <persName corresp="#CAA">Christine Alexander</persName> comments, nineteenth&#x2010;century child writers appropriated adult voices and their discourses in order to gain 
                        &#x201c;the freedoms of the adult world&#x201d;. Although working &#x201c;within a defined discourse&#x201d; that they found ready made, in doing so child 
                        writers gave &#x201c;an account of both their own and the adult world&#x201d;, empowering themselves 
                        to &#x201c;construct an identity of authorship&#x201d; chosen in &#x201c;response to the print culture of their time&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ALEXANDERPLAYANDAPPRENTICESHIP"><persName corresp="#CAA">Alexander</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#ALEXANDERPLAYANDAPPRENTICESHIP">&#x201C;Play and Apprenticeship&#x201D;</title></ref>, 31). 
                        Reproducing typography and obeying its constraints could be a creative exercise.</p>
                    
                    <p>For example, in <ref type="witness" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_msi.php">&#x201c;Harry and Lucy Concluded&#x201d;</ref>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> paradoxically enfranchised his inventiveness 
                        by constraining his lettering within the guidelines of bookmaking. For example, he imitated the justification of printed text, right and left, 
                        but he evidently found it difficult to space his letter&#x2010; and word&#x2010;spacing within a line of prose, so as to end a word on the right&#x2010;justified margin. 
                        He understood that words could be broken at the margin using a hyphen, and he did adopt that expediency. 
                        More often, however, he put that punctuation mark to work in his own way, by deploying it, not to divide words, 
                        but to justify the right margin by filling any gap between the margin and words falling at the end of a line. Hence, he invented a new punctuation mark&#x2014;or a new use 
                        for an existing mark&#x2014;in the form of a varying&#x2010;length hyphen. In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, the mark is designated as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s <hi rend="italic">justification mark</hi> 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="editorial_rationale_note.php#JUSTIFICATION">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology: Element, Attribute, and Value Usage&#x2014;Justification, Runover, and Word Division</ref>). 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> continued to use this mark for the purpose of right&#x2010;justifying text at least through <date when="1834">1834</date>, in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copy of 
                        <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">An Account of a Tour of the Continent</title>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Difficulties could arise when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> set himself particularly exacting imitative or decorative lettering tasks, 
                        such as the elaborate double&#x2010;print lettering for the poem, 
                        <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="a_battle_irregular_measure_apparatus"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRABATTLEIRREGULARMEASURE">&#x201C;A Battle: Irregular Measure&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        which he apparently failed to complete in time for a holiday presentation to his father (see 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol3_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#HARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 3</title></ref>).<!-- DCH CHECK --> 
                        This problem would be solved by adopting an easier &#x201c;copperplate&#x201d; round hand for fair copies of his poems&#x2014;especially longer poems, 
                        such as <title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201c;Iteriad&#x201d;</title> and <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</title> (<ref type="internal" target="#COPYBOOK">The Ruskins and Copybook Self&#x2010;Culture</ref>). 
                        But despite its occasional costs, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would always take pleasure in copying, it seems, and in what the exercise could reveal&#x2014;a quality that perhaps extended later to his drawing.</p>

                    especially for his fair&#x2010;copy poems and for some letters addressed to his father. <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02bc;s narrative is deficient, however, in supposing that 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was entirely and precociously self&#x2010;taught in his handwriting until required to imitate a copybook round hand, 
                    modeling the personality of his hand on his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName>&#x02BC;s mercantile writing. The narrative 
                    not only neglects to identify what precisely was precocious and self&#x2010;fashioning about his earliest hand as compared with male discipline &#x201c;under orders&#x201d; of copybook instruction; 
                    the story also fails even to pose questions about his mother&#x02bc;s teaching. <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> frames <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s education in writing 
                    as a Rousseauist and Wordsworthian binary of nature and culture that refuses even to take account of mothers as the primary mediators of the written word 
                    (&#x201c;there is some trace of teaching at the very start&#x201d;)&#x2014;a role that <persName corresp="#MMYERS">Mitzi Myers</persName> 
                    and others have worked to reinstate in histories of education and children&#x02BC;s literature.</p>
                
                <p>Even apart from its underlying ideological framework, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02bc;s argument appears skewed by the context of its publication. 
                    Remarking on variations in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s handwriting, 
                    <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> explains these using a sweeping claim about the &#x201c;chameleon&#x201d; quality of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s personality: 
                    &#x201c;For his mother he had another hand; for his friends and for himself an assortment of varying scribbles. 
                    But there, I think, comes out one of the leading points in his character. To be a man of strong thought and will, 
                    innovator in art, science, politics, morality, and religion, there never was such a chameleon, always ready to colour his mind 
                    after his surroundings; all things to all men&#x201d;

                    As an account of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s handwriting, this polemical explanation is interesting 
                    as evidence connected with <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s reception around <date when="1900">1900</date>, the year of his death, 
                    but the approach seems to have prevented <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> from conveying effectively the intimate knowledge 
                    he must have gathered over the years about the physical family manuscripts, or thinking about that evidence in context of an early nineteenth&#x2010;century, middle&#x2010;class home education.</p>
                
                <p>One such benchmark was <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s first use of pen and ink. According to <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>, 
                    this occurred in <date when="1827-04">April 1827</date>, but she cuts directly to his accomplishment, omitting the role 
                    she must have played in supplying the writing materials, teaching him to hold a pen, and monitoring his practice: 
                    &#x201c;<persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> has sent you his first written letter . . . he is much delighted at being able to use pen &#x0026; ink&#x201d;

                    <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> may have appropriated control over this advance in <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02bc;s handwriting, treating it as a rite of passage for his son. 
                    But <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s use of pen and ink cannot be neatly compartmentalized, as <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> does in his version of the story, as the sudden adoption &#x201c;under orders&#x201d; 
                    of a male &#x201c;commercial&#x201d; round hand like his father&#x02bc;s. While <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02bc;s writing instruction prior to <date when="1827">1827</date> goes unmentioned 
                    in the family letters, his first cursive script (<date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1829">1827&#x2013;29</date>) appears to have been modeled on his mother&#x02bc;s.</p>

                        and that is free of pencil tracing underneath. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> never produced a miniscule hand like the <orgName corresp="#BRONTES">Bront&#x00EB;s</orgName>&#x02BC;, however.</p>
                    
                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> probably learned to write in ink using a quill, if trade statistics for the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> 
                        provide a reliable guide. In <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> alone, imported goose quills consumed annually averaged around 20 million, 
                        and the country as a whole used about double that number. However, the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> 
                        also witnessed the mass production of steel pens&#x2014;referring to what nowadays is typically called the <hi rend="italic">nib</hi>, as opposed to the pen&#x2010;holder held in the hand&#x2014;and by <date when="1838">1838</date> this output increased to 220 million. In the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, 
                        manufacturers (chiefly in <placeName corresp="#BIRMINGHAM">Birmingham</placeName>) were improving the flexibility of pens as well producing them in quantities sufficient to lower their retail cost considerably. 
                        Even fountain&#x2010;pens were being patented, although not mass-produced until the end of the century. These alternatives to the traditional quill became more affordable and widely used in the 
                        <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>. Quills of any kind were purchased already prepared or &#x201C;dressed&#x201D;; and as the huge consumption suggests, 
                        consumers typically were unskilled in mending a quill for extended use, or unwilling to take the trouble, 
                        preferring merely to discard a dull pen for a fresh one. Steel pens broke easily, but as they became cheaper (dropping from about eighteen shillings per dozen at the start of the century 
                        to about fourpence per gross by <date when="1838">1838</date>), these too could be painlessly discarded by the middle&#x2010;class writer

                        He was exhibiting the range of his pen&#x2010;and&#x2010;ink skills, and possibly also distinguishing between the cursive hand appropriate to a letter, and the imitation of typography appropriate to a poem.</p>

                        resembles his <persName corresp="#MR">mother</persName>&#x02BC;s&#x2014;so closely, that their hands can easily be confused 
                        with one another if the content fails to supply a clue. It is understandable that a home&#x2010;schooled youth 
                        would initially imitate his mother&#x02BC;s hand, particularly in a household like the Ruskins&#x02BC;, 
                        from which the father was absent for protracted periods. <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> was, after all, 
                        the most constant daily influence on <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02bc;s early education,

                        as his default hand for rough draft of poetry and prose. An early example is the poem, 
                        <ref type="witness" target="constellations_msrft70.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations: Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and Some of the Southern&#x201D;</title></ref> in its RF T70 version

                        This manuscript originated as a fair copy of the poem, using an ink, print&#x2010;lettered hand similar in appearance to the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>, which is dated ca. <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1828">1827&#x2013;28</date> (books 1&#x2013;2). 
                        In the margins, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> revised the poem in a sprawling cursive hand, using both pen and pencil. This version of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title> is undated, 
                        but it certainly predated the <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1828">late 1827&#x2013;early 1828</date>

                        which incorporates the revisions. The cursive hand is awkward, but recognizably <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s, and legible without difficulty. 
                        Judging by the pencil cursive hand used for the ca. <date notBefore="1829-02" notAfter="1829-05">February&#x2013;May 1829</date> rough draft of

                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s cursive hand for personal use got worse in legibility before it got better, but remaining large and sprawling, 
                        recklessly occupying a large space on paper.

                        who had held the post of writing master and accountant at the <orgName corresp="#RHSE">Royal High School</orgName>, <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName>,

                    <p>Apparently, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> regarded this juncture in the development of his son&#x02bc;s handwriting as a coming of age, 
                        analogous to his own. When <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> enrolled at the <orgName corresp="#RHSE">Edinburgh Royal High</orgName> at age ten, 
                        he was already somewhat older than his class, the customary starting age being eight&#x2014;<persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02bc;s age when first using a pen. 
                        Scottish burgh schools like the <orgName corresp="#RHSE">Edinburgh Royal High</orgName> in theory championed a democratic ideal 
                        of seating tradesmen&#x02BC;s sons alongside those of patricians, and fees were kept moderate. Nonetheless, the Ruskin family 
                        may have delayed in order to scrape together the means even for moderate fees, or <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s mother, <persName corresp="#CTWR">Catherine</persName>, 
                        may have been apprehensive of exposing him to a famously sadistic Latin master

                        Given his own delayed matriculation, whatever its cause, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> perhaps acted with deliberate resolve in introducing his son in <date when="1827">1827</date>, at age eight,

                        Even at the <orgName corresp="#RHSE">Edinburgh Royal High</orgName>, the writing and arithmetic classes had always been optional, the expectation being that many youths would acquire these accomplishments

                        round hand called for a looping style that accentuated contrasts of thin and thick strokes, a style related to the late eighteenth&#x2010;century transitional and modern typefaces

                        In the eighteenth century, round hand settled into a practical but elegant script that was less elaborate than earlier versions, and that was widely used in business. 
                        In the view of a historian of calligraphy, the common English round hand was &#x201C;colourless, thoroughly unromantic, and dull&#x201D;; however, these &#x201C;were precisely

                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> consulted <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName>&#x02bc;s copybook, then, to &#x201c;publish&#x201d; his poems and other productions in a family context, 
                        just as he had always copied from print sources to produce his presentation copies of poems for his father and other works. 
                        <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName>&#x02bc;s practical text, however, modeled an elegant but easy round hand that was less demanding and time&#x2010;consuming than his earlier &#x201c;double print&#x201d;, 
                        while at the same time supplying patterns for elaborate flourishes where needed, such as the &#x201c;finis&#x201d; of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201c;Iteriad&#x201d;</title>. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> seems not to have used <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName>&#x02bc;s copybook to improve his everyday cursive script, in which he took his own way.</p>
                    
                    <p>Nor would the elder Ruskins necessarily have expected such thorough discipline. <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02bc;s skepticism about the fixation 
                        on presentation at the expense of &#x201c;expression&#x201d; has alreay been cited. <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> took the opposite approach 
                        to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s cousin, 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_william_note.php"><persName corresp="#JRPSONWILLIAM">William Richardson</persName> (<date notBefore="1811-07-26" notAfter="1875-09-18">1811&#x2013;75</date>)</ref>, 
                        whom she regarded as limited in abilities, but industrious. For <persName corresp="#JRPSONWILLIAM">William</persName>, exercises in <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName> seemed the ticket 
                        to success: &#x201c;The very dullness of his faculties in childhood&#x201d;, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> reasoned, 
                        &#x201c;has induced such habits of laborious study as will at least place him on an equality if he does not go beyond many 
                        of far higher genius&#x201d;; and one sign of the dogged self&#x2010;improvement was his &#x201c;trying by copying <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName> to improve 
                        his writing&#x201d; (<ref type="apparatus" target="mr_to_jjr_1831-03-17_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="mr_to_jjr_1831-03-17">letter to <persName corresp="JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, <date when="1827-03-17">17 March 1831</date></title></ref> [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 251]). 
                        In <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02bc;s case, methodical discipline was perhaps a duty to be paid for his gift of invention, 
                        but laborious exercises were not required, as in <persName corresp="#JRPSONWILLIAM">William</persName>&#x02bc;s case, to make up for the lack in native genius. 
                        As <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> assured <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> at age ten: &#x201c;It would be sinful in you to let the powers of your mind lie dormant through idleness 
                        or want of perseverance when they may at their maturity aid the cause of Truth &#x0026; of Religion&#x201d;, 
                        for his genius had &#x201c;doomed [him] to enlighten a People by your Wisdom &#x0026; to adorn an age by your Learning&#x201d;

                            The editors of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> repeat this characterization verbatim, in reprinting <persName corresp="#MRC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            &#x201C;Note&#x201D; respecting <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>; however, they effectively modify this characterization in a note appended to another section of the

                            which they speculate to have been copied in &#x201C;a lady&#x02BC;s hand (query&#x2014;his mother&#x02BC;s [i.e., <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s])&#x201D;

                            of fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>, but is written on two leaves (both sides of each) bound into <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSSXI">MS XI</title>, 
                            but the hand used for this fair copy appears identical to that used for the poems in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>. <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> 
                            and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> seem to acknowledge the identical hands by repeating <persName corresp="#MRC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s characterization of a 
                            &#x201C;female&#x201C; or &#x201C;lady&#x02BC;s hand, albeit dodging the implication of their &#x201C;query&#x02BC;&#x2014;that if <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> 
                            fair&#x2010;copied the item in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSSXI">MS XI</title>, then she also copied the times in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>.</p>
                    
                        <p>The hand is in fact markedly more elegant than <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s, although it does exhibit a few characteristics typical of both hers and 
                            <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hands, characteristics that are not found in <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s&#x2014;namely, a 
                            long medial <hi rend="italic">s</hi> as the first stroke of a double&#x2010;<hi rend="italic">s</hi>; and heavy reliance on the ampersand. One might be tempted to ascribe the hand 
                            to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>; however, as <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> point out more helpfully than in what 
                            they&#x02BC;ve so far contributed to the question, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hand is unquestionably responsible for an attribution and dateline that follow

                            this hand definitely contrasts with that of the transcription itself (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 2:380 n. 1).</p>
