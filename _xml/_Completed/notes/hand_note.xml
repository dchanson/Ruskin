                            <p>[<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>] developed his own writing like other precocious boys and girls, though there is some trace of teaching 
                                    at the very start. But after <date when="1830">1830</date> he exchanged, perhaps at the instance of superior orders, his &#x201c;print&#x201d; 
                                    for copperplate; the <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="iteriad_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201c;Iteriad&#x201d;</title></ref>

                                    are in a smaller, less anxious, but more formed business style. One sees the father&#x02bc;s influence 
                                    coming in, and all his letters to the old&#x2010;fashioned business man show the obvious desire to please.

                                    at the end is in black letter, finishing a sheet of impeccable commercial&#x2010;hand, in which the

                <p>As an example of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s letters to his father with embellished salutations and signtures 
                    that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> was describing, see the 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1831-03-06_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_jjr_1831-03-06">letter of <date when="1831-03-06">6 March 1831</date></title></ref> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref> 233&#x2013;35). 
                    As this and many other documents show, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did employ a &#x201c;copperplate&#x201d; cursive hand in the <date notBefore="1830-01-01" notAfter="1839-12-31">1830s</date>, 
                    especially for his fair&#x2010;copy poems and for some letters addressed to his father. <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02bc;s narrative is deficient, however, in supposing that 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was entirely and precociously self&#x2010;taught in his handwriting until required to imitate a copybook round hand, 
                    modeling the personality of his hand on his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName>&#x02BC;s mercantile writing. The narrative 
                    not only neglects to identify what precisely was precocious and inventive about his earliest hand as compared with the discipline &#x201c;under orders&#x201d; of copybook instruction; 
                    the story also fails even to pose questions about his mother&#x02bc;s teaching, and how and why that teaching was supplanted&#x2014;it it was so&#x2014;by copybook training.</p>
                
                <p><persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> comments on variations in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s handwriting, 
                    but attributes these to a sweeping claim about the &#x201c;chameleon&#x201d; quality of his personality: 
                    &#x201c;For his mother he had another hand; for his friends and for himself an assortment of varying scribbles. 
                    But there, I think, comes out one of the leading points in his character. To be a man of strong thought and will, 
                    innovator in art, science, politics, morality, and religion, there never was such a chameleon, always ready to colour his mind 
                    after his surroundings; all things to all men&#x201d; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#COLLINGWOODRUSKINSHAND">Collingwood, <title type="essay" corresp="WGCRUSKINSHAND">&#x201C;Ruskin&#x02BC;s Hand&#x201D;</title>, <title type="periodical" corresp="#GOODWORDS"><hi rend="italic">Good Words</hi></title></ref>, 652;

                    <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> originally wrote this essay for <title type="periodical" corresp="#GOODWORDS"><hi rend="italic">Good Words</hi></title>, 
                    a nondenominational <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christian</orgName> magazine with Scottish connections. His observation about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s chameleon character&#x2014;besides seeming patently untrue&#x2014;likely played to 
                    the magazine&#x02bc;s ecumenical mission. (<title type="periodical" corresp="#GOODWORDS"><hi rend="italic">Good Words</hi></title> promised to enliven the dullness of English Sabbatarianism by extending the boundaries 
                    of Sunday devotional reading to include <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christian</orgName> thought in secular genres, especially poetry 
                    [see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EHNESGOODWORDS"><persName corresp="#CEHNES">Ehnes</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#EHNESGOODWORDS">&#x201C;Religion, Readership, and the Periodical Press&#x201D;</title></ref>].) 
                    As an approach to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s handwriting, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02bc;s polemical explanation is interesting 
                    as evidence of the reception of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s ideas around <date when="1900">1900</date>. The purpose of this note is more empirical, to organize evidence from the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</date> of 
                    family and cultural influences on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s various scripts, which are facsimilied throughout <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>.</p>
                
                <p><persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02bc;s most untenable assumption is that the story of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s developing handwriting 
                    can be limited to the boy&#x02bc;s precocity and his father&#x02bc;s masculine mercantile discipline, 
                    whereas it was obviously <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> who presided over the scenes of writing 
                    during <persName corresp="#JR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s frequent absences on business trips. In the family letters, 
                    <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> does tend, however, to record events in the development 
                    of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s hand, as if he simply performed these feats unaided&#x2014;like a creature in nature prodding itself to walk upright. 
                    One such benchmark was <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s first use of pen and ink. According to <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>, 
                    this occurred in <date when="1827-04">April 1827</date>, but she cuts directly to his accomplishment, omitting the role 
                    she must have played in supplying the writing materials, teaching him to hold a pen, and monitoring his practice: 
                    &#x201c;<persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> has sent you his first written letter . . . he is much delighted at being able to use pen &#x0026; ink&#x201d; 
                    (<ref type="apparatus" target="mr_to_jjr_1827-04-28_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="mr_to_jjr_1827-04-28">Margaret to John James Ruskin, <date when="1827-04-28">28 April 1827</date></title></ref> 
                    [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 156]; 
                    on the identify of the &#x201c;first written letter&#x201d;, see 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1827-05_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_jjr_1827-05"><persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, <date when="1827-05">May 1827</date></title></ref>). 
                    From this point, as suggested in <ref type="internal" target="#COPYBOOK">The Ruskins and Copybook Self&#x2010;Culture</ref>, 
                    <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> may have appropriated control over this advance in <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02bc;s handwriting, treating it as a rite of passage for his son. 
                    But <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s use of pen and ink cannot be neatly compartmentalized, as <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> tells the story, as the sudden adoption &#x201c;under orders&#x201d; 
                    of a male &#x201c;commercial&#x201d; round hand like his father&#x02bc;s. While <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02bc;s writing instruction prior to <date when="1827">1827</date> goes unmentioned 
                    in the family letters, his first cursive script (<date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1829">1827&#x2013;29</date>) appears to have been modeled on his mother&#x02bc;s.</p>

                        The lettering generally suggests the English transitional serif typefaces, such as Baskerville and Bulmer, 
                        and their predecessor, Caslon, which predominated in British books of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

                        also flourished his lettering with decorative capitals that he called &#x201C;double&#x201D; print in the <date notBefore="1828-01-01" notAfter="1829-12-31">1828&#x2013;29</date>

                    <p>While Ruskin appears to have derived his double&#x2010;print lettering primarily from a serif model, 
                        some of his fancy lettering was perhaps based on the sanserif typefaces that began as a neoclassical revival in the <date notBefore="1780" notAfter="1789">1780</date>s 
                        and sprang into a variety of forms and associations in the first decades of the nineteenth century

                        From the perspective of the nineteenth&#x2010;century child writer, however, what seems a deflection into pedantry may have been a source of empowerment.

                        Granted, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did not merely copy <persName corresp="#ME">Maria Edgeworth</persName>&#x02bc;s dialogues, but adapted the genre to depicting daily life at <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName>. 
                        He did, however, directly copy the experiments that he folded into the tale from <persName corresp="#JJ">Jeremiah Joyce</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="book" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></title>,

                        writers gave &#x201c;an account of both their own and the adult world&#x201d;, empowering themselves 
                        to &#x201c;construct an identity of authorship&#x201d; chosen in &#x201c;response to the print culture of their time&#x201d;

                        In <ref type="witness" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_msi.php">&#x201c;Harry and Lucy Concluded&#x201d;</ref>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> paradoxically enfranchised his inventiveness 
                        by constraining his lettering within the guidelines of bookmaking. For example, he imitated the justification of printed text, right and left, 
                        but he evidently found it difficult to space his letter&#x2010; and word&#x2010;spacing within a line of prose, so as to end a word on the right&#x2010;justified margin. 
                        He understood that words could be broken at the margin using a hyphen, and he did adopt that expediency. 
                        More often, however, he put that punctuation mark to work in his own way, by deploying it, not to divide words, 
                        but to fill the space between words that falls at the end of a line. Hence, he invented a new punctuation mark&#x2014;or new use 
                        of an existing one&#x2014;in the varying&#x2010;length hyphen. In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, the mark is designated as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s <hi rend="italic">justification mark</hi> 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="editorial_rationale_note.php#JUSTIFICATION">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology: Element, Attribute, and Value Usage&#x2014;Justification, Runover, and Word Division</ref>). 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> continued to use this mark for the purpose of right&#x2010;justifying text at least through <date when="1834">1834</date>, in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copy of

                    <p>Problems could arise when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> set himself particularly exacting imitative or decorative lettering tasks, 
                        such as the elaborate double&#x2010;print lettering for the poem, 
                        <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="a_battle_irregular_measure_apparatus"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRABATTLEIRREGULARMEASURE">&#x201C;A Battle: Irregular Measure&#x201D;</title></ref>,

                        This problem would be solved by adopting an easier &#x201c;copperplate&#x201d; round hand for fair copies of his poems&#x2014;especially longer poems,

                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> probably learned to write in ink using a quill, if trade statistics for the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> 
                        provide a reliable guide. In <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> alone, imported goose quills consumed annually averaged around 20 million, 
                        and the country as a whole used about double that number. However, the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> 
                        also witnessed the mass production of steel pens&#x2014;referring to what nowadays is typically called the <hi rend="italic">nib</hi>, as opposed to the pen&#x2010;holder held in the hand&#x2014;and by <date when="1838">1838</date> this output increased to 220 million. In the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, 
                        manufacturers (chiefly in <placeName corresp="#BIRMINGHAM">Birmingham</placeName>) were improving the flexibility of pens as well producing them in quantities sufficient to lower their retail cost considerably. 
                        Even fountain&#x2010;pens were being patented, although not mass-produced until the end of the century. These alternatives to the traditional quill became more affordable and widely used in the 
                        <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>. Quills of any kind were purchased already prepared or &#x201C;dressed&#x201D;; and as the huge consumption suggests, 
                        consumers typically were unskilled in mending a quill for extended use, or unwilling to take the trouble, 
                        preferring merely to discard a dull pen for a fresh one. Steel pens broke easily, but as they became cheaper (dropping from about eighteen shillings per dozen at the start of the century 
                        to about fourpence per gross by <date when="1838">1838</date>), these too could be painlessly discarded by the middle&#x2010;class writer

                        the body of the letter is written in pencil and in a cursive hand, which he apparently already commanded. 
                        At the end of the letter, between the closing and the signature, he exhibited his newly acquired pen skills by inserting a sentence&#x2014;likewise in cursive, but using pen and ink:

                        He was exhibiting the range of his pen&#x2010;and&#x2010;ink skills, and possibly also distinguishing between the cursive hand appropriate to a letter, and the imitation of typography appropriate to a poem.</p>

                        downstrokes bold and dark, upstrokes and connecting lines fine, and the ascenders and descenders long. Capital letters are frequent.

                        with one another if the content fails to supply a clue. It is understandable that a home&#x2010;schooled youth 
                        would initially imitate his mother&#x02BC;s hand, particularly in a household like the Ruskins&#x02BC;, 
                        from which the father was absent for protracted periods. <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> was, after all,

                        as his default hand for rough draft of poetry and prose. An early example is the poem, 
                        <ref type="witness" target="constellations_msrft70.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations: Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and Some of the Southern&#x201D;</title></ref> in its RF T70 version

                        This manuscript originated as a fair copy of the poem, using an ink, print&#x2010;lettered hand similar in appearance to the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>, which is dated ca. <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1828">1827&#x2013;28</date> (books 1&#x2013;2). 
                        In the margins, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> revised the poem in a sprawling cursive hand, using both pen and pencil. This version of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title> is undated, 
                        but it certainly predated the <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1828">late 1827&#x2013;early 1828</date>

                        which incorporates the revisions. The cursive hand is awkward, but recognizably <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s, and legible without difficulty. 
                        Judging by the pencil cursive hand used for the ca. <date notBefore="1829-02" notAfter="1829-05">February&#x2013;May 1829</date> rough draft of

                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s cursive hand for personal use got worse in legibility before it got better, but remaining large and sprawling, 
                        recklessly occupying a large space on paper.

                        the cursive hand for rough draft is smaller, more consistent in size of lettering, and fluid&#x2014;and always in ink.</p>

                    <p>Apparently, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> regarded this juncture in the development of his son&#x02bc;s handwriting as a coming of age, 
                        analogous to his own. When <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> enrolled at the <orgName corresp="#RHSE">Edinburgh Royal High</orgName> at age ten, 
                        he was already somewhat older than his class, the customary starting age being eight&#x2014;<persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02bc;s age when first using a pen. 
                        Scottish burgh schools like the <orgName corresp="#RHSE">Edinburgh Royal High</orgName> in theory championed a democratic ideal 
                        of seating tradesmen&#x02BC;s sons alongside those of patricians, and fees were kept moderate. Nonetheless, the Ruskin family 
                        may have delayed in order to scrape together the means even for moderate fees, or <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s mother, <persName corresp="#CTWR">Catherine</persName>, 
                        may have been apprehensive of exposing him to a famously sadistic Latin master

                        Given his own delayed matriculation, whatever its cause, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> perhaps acted with deliberate resolve in introducing his son in <date when="1827">1827</date>, at age eight,

                        Most copybooks modeled the formal script known as <hi rend="italic">English round hand</hi> or <hi rend="italic">copperplate</hi>, for which 
                        an influential standard had been set by the copybook, <title type="manual_guide" corresp="#BICKHAMUNIVERSALPENMAN"><hi rend="italic">Universal Penman</hi></title> (<date notBefore="1733" notAfter="1741">1733&#x2013;41</date>),

                        round hand called for a looping style that accentuated contrasts of thin and thick strokes, a style related to the late eighteenth&#x2010;century transitional and modern typefaces 
                        that featured these extreme contrasts, such as Baskerville and Bodoni 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CRAMSIEGRAPHIC">Cramsie, <title type="book" corresp="#CRAMSIEGRAPHIC"><hi rend="italic">Story of Graphic Design</hi></title></ref>, 119&#x2013;21). 
                        In the eighteenth century, round hand settled into a practical but elegant script that was less elaborate than earlier versions, and that was widely used in business. 
                        In the view of a historian of calligraphy, the common English round hand was &#x201C;colourless, thoroughly unromantic, and dull&#x201D;; however, these &#x201C;were precisely 
                        the qualities which commended [the hand] to those who wrote our invoices and to those abroad who received them&#x201D;; and this &#x201C;plain hand for a plain purpose&#x201D; 
                        was typified in the nineteenth century by &#x201C;the books of <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName>&#x201D;, in which the hand became &#x201C;even more matter&#x2010;of&#x2010;fact and more standardised&#x201D;

                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> consulted <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName>&#x02bc;s copybook, then, to &#x201c;publish&#x201d; his poems and other productions in a family context, 
                        just as he had always copied from print sources to produce his presentation copies of poems for his father and other works. 
                        <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName>&#x02bc;s practical text, however, modeled an elegant but easy round hand that was less demanding and time&#x2010;consuming than his earlier &#x201c;double print&#x201d;, 
                        while at the same time supplying patterns for elaborate flourishes where needed, such as the &#x201c;finis&#x201d; of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201c;Iteriad&#x201d;</title>. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> seems not to have used <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName>&#x02bc;s copybook to improve his everyday cursive script, in which he took his own way.</p>
                    
                    <p>Nor would the elder Ruskins necessarily have expected such thorough discipline. <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02bc;s skepticism about the fixation 
                        on presentation at the expense of &#x201c;expression&#x201d; has alreay been cited. <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> took the opposite approach 
                        to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s cousin,

                        whom she regarded as limited in abilities, but industrious. For <persName corresp="#JRPSONWILLIAM">William</persName>, exercises in <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName> seemed the ticket 
                        to success: &#x201c;The very dullness of his faculties in childhood&#x201d;, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> reasoned, 
                        &#x201c;has induced such habits of laborious study as will at least place him on an equality if he does not go beyond many 
                        of far higher genius&#x201d;; and one sign of the dogged self&#x2010;improvement was his &#x201c;trying by copying <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName> to improve 
                        his writing&#x201d; (<ref type="apparatus" target="mr_to_jjr_1831-03-17_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="mr_to_jjr_1831-03-17">letter to <persName corresp="JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, <date when="1827-03-17">17 March 1831</date></title></ref> [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 251]). 
                        In <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02bc;s case, methodical discipline was perhaps a duty to be paid for his gift of invention,

                        As <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> assured <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> at age ten: &#x201c;It would be sinful in you to let the powers of your mind lie dormant through idleness 
                        or want of perseverance when they may at their maturity aid the cause of Truth &#x0026; of Religion&#x201d;,

                        <p>The hand is in fact markedly more elegant than <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s, although it does exhibit a few characteristics typical of both hers and 
                            <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hands, characteristics that are not found in <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s&#x2014;namely, a
