                    <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> claims that, in childhood, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                    &#x201c;developed his own writing like other precocious boys and girls, though there is some trace of teaching at the very start&#x201d;; 
                    and then later, &#x201c;after <date when="1830">1830</date>, he exchanged, perhaps at the instance of superior orders, his &#x2018;print&#x2019; 
                    for copperplate&#x201d;, imitating his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName>&#x02BC;s mercantile round hand with the aid of a copybook

                    Seemingly the most untenable assumption in <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02bc;s account is the exclusion of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s mother from any role in his developing handwriting, 
                    by limiting the story to the boy&#x02bc;s precocity and his father&#x02bc;s masculine mercantile discipline. 
                    Who else but <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> presided over the scenes of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s first handwriting 
                    during <persName corresp="#JR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s frequent absences on business trips? (See <ref type="internal" target="#CURSIVE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s Cursive Hand</ref>.)</p>
                    
                    <p>Yet, in the family letters, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> does tend to absent herself from reports of 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s progress in handwriting, as if he simply performed these feats unaided, like 
                        a creature in nature starting to use its limbs. On <date when="1823-03-15">15 March 1823</date>, when <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> transcribed &#x201C;exactly word for word&#x201D; what 
                        the four year old &#x201C;said was a letter to send to&#x201D; his father and &#x201C;pretended to read&#x201D; for his mother&#x02BC;s dictation &#x201C;from his paper&#x201D; on which he had &#x201C;been very busy 
                        scrawling with a pencil&#x201D;&#x2014;<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;first letter&#x201D;, as it has been called&#x2014;<persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> remarked &#x201C;he is beginning to copy from his books

While it seems unlikely that <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> provided <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> with no direction whatever 
                        when &#x201C;learn[ing] himself to write&#x201D;, evidence of his &#x201C;copy[ing] from his books&#x201D; as a possible auto&#x2010;didactic practice 
                        does survive in his copy of <title type="book" corresp="#DAYHISTORY"><hi rend="italic">The History of Little Jack</hi></title> by <persName corresp="#TD">Thomas Day</persName>

                        Throughout the book, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> traced the outlines of the engraved illustrations on the blank reverse of those pages 
                        (omitting to outline only the illustration of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Little Jack</persName> fighting with another boy), and on one page he has copied words.</p>

                                <p>But the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#OLDMANTD">old man</persName>, as he was something of a scholar, had a great ambition that his darling
                                    should learn to read and write: and this was a work of some difficulty; for he had neither 
                                    printed book, nor pens, nor paper, in his cabin. Industry, however, enables us to overcome difficulties: 
                                    in the summer&#x2010;time, as the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#OLDMANTD">old man</persName> sat before his cottage, he would draw letters in the sand, 
                                    and teach <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Jack</persName> to name them singly, until he was acquainted with the whole alphabet. 
                                    He then proceeded to syllables, and after that to words; all which his little pupil learned 
                                    to pronounce with great facility: and, as he had a strong propensity to imitate what he saw, 
                                    he not only acquired the power of reading words, but of tracing all the letters 
                                    which composed them on the sand.</p>

                    <p>In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s copy of the book, the outlines of the woodcuts testify to his sharing <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LITTLEJACKTD">Little Jack</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;strong propensity to imitate what he saw&#x201D;, while scattered, penciled words in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand on a flyleaf 
                        may be artifacts of his &#x201C;learn[ing] himself to write&#x201D; by imitation, as well. (Some of the barely legible, smeared words&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">arrived</hi>, <hi rend="italic">preserve</hi>&#x2014;can be found in the printed text.) 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> can scarcely have relied solely on himself, however, for the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#OLDMANTD">old man</persName>&#x02BC;s method of progressing from alphabet to syllables to words. 
                        Words written in ink by both <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> and <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> are found in the book as well, attesting to their guidance.</p>
                    
                    <p>Prior to this writing instruction and practice circa <date when="1823">1823</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was already able to print his name in pencil. 
                        In her <date when="1823-03-15">15 March 1823</date> letter containing her transcription of <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s so&#x2010;called <hi rend="italic">first letter</hi>, 
                        <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> pointed out to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> that &#x201C;the signature you will see is his own&#x201D;, although &#x201C;sometimes he makes the letters much better&#x201D;

                        that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s earliest surviving signature can be detected in a scrawl that forms a vague shape like a <hi rend="italic">J</hi>&#x2014;an

                    <p>In his earliest pencil lettering, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> formed his characters very large <!--  as well as in his earliest pen&#x2010;and&#x2010;ink lettering (e.g., in portions of <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref>),--> 
                        and allowed ample interlinear space&#x2014;the line spacing owing in part to his following the pre&#x2010;ruled lines in the stationer&#x02bc;s notebooks known in the family as the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title></ref>. 
                        The model for his large (and, by <date when="1826">1826</date>, well&#x2010;formed) lettering probably lay in the typography of his books&#x2014;not in a handwriting copybook, which <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> acquired for him in <date when="1827">1827</date>, but which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears not to have used immediately

                        In the <date notBefore="1767" notAfter="1834">late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries</date>, a precedent for typography in children&#x02bc;s books had been set by

                        It is not known if <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was exposed to <persName corresp="#ALB">Barbauld</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="book" corresp="#BARBAULDLESSONS"><hi rend="italic">Lessons</hi></title>, which <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> like countless mothers may have used to teach him to read when very young

                    <p>At the same time, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s early pencil print lettering already shows signs of being modeled on favorite books that were not intended for small children. For example, in 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I&#x201D;</title></ref>,

                        he imitated the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="edgeworth_harry_and_lucy_concluded_note.php">original&#x02BC;s title page</ref>; and in the text, he may have modeled his letters on the serif typeface used for <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        books, even adopting a decorative capital <hi rend="italic">Y</hi> from the display type of the title page. 
                        (The lettering suggests Caslon or perhaps the English transitional serif typefaces, such as Baskerville and Bulmer, 
                        which predominated in British books of the <date notBefore="1767" notAfter="1834">late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries</date>.) Another influential model was the <title type="series" corresp="#DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">&#x201C;Dove&#x02BC;s English Classics&#x201D;</title>, 
                        a reprint series of which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> owned volumes of <persName corresp="#APOPE">Pope</persName>&#x02BC;s translation of the <title type="poem" corresp="#HOMERILIAD"><hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi></title> (<date when="1824">1824</date>) 
                        and of <persName corresp="#JDRYDEN">Dryden</persName>&#x02BC;s translation of the <title type="poem" corresp="#VIRGILAENEID"><hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi></title> and other works by <persName corresp="#VIRGIL">Virgil</persName> (<date when="1825">1825</date>). 
                        At three by five inches, much smaller than the <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName> volumes, 
                        the <title type="series" corresp="#DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">&#x201C;Dove&#x02BC;s English Classics&#x201D;</title> were comparable in size to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title></ref>, 
                        but typographically the text was the opposite of <persName corresp="#ALB">Barbauld</persName>&#x02bc;s child&#x2010;friendly large and spacious type. 
                        The densely set lines of verse on small pages resulted in many runovers, which the printer/publisher <orgName corresp="#JFDOVEPUB">J. F. Dove</orgName> signaled with a right&#x2010;facing square bracket <hi rend="italic">[</hi>, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> precisely imitated 
                        when his own poems crowded the margins of his <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title></ref> 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="boyhood_books_note.php#DESCRIPTIONS">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Physical Descriptions</ref>;

                    <p>As another creative solution to problems occasioned <!--in <ref type="witness" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_msi.php">&#x201c;Harry and Lucy Concluded&#x201d;</ref>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> paradoxically enfranchised his inventiveness--> 
                        by constraining his lettering within the guidelines of bookmaking, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> invented a punctuatoin mark enabling him to imitate a text block, justified right and left. 
                        Encountering difficulty in managing his letter&#x2010; and word&#x2010;spacing so as to end a line of prose on the right&#x2010;justified margin, 
                        he filled in the gap with a variable&#x2010;length hyphen. Presumably, he based his mark on hyphenation used in print to divide words at the margin, 
                        and he did also employ the hyphen for that purpose. More often, however, he effectively adapted the hyphen as an original punctuation mark, whose varying length enabled him to justify margins. 
                        In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, the mark is designated as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s <hi rend="italic">justification mark</hi> 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="editorial_rationale_note.php#JUSTIFICATION">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology: Element, Attribute, and Value Usage&#x2014;Justification, Runover, and Word Division</ref>). 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> continued to use this mark for the purpose of right&#x2010;justifying text at least through <date when="1834">1834</date>, in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copy of 
                        <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">An Account of a Tour of the Continent</title> (<date when="1834">1834</date>.</p>
                    
                    <p>A particularly obsessive and time&#x2010;consuming typographic imitation that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> adopted to ornament his printed lettering 
                        was a decorative capital that he called &#x201C;double&#x201D; print. This was formed with a doubled downward or upward stroke, which could be left open or filled wtih shadow. 
                        Examples occur in the earliest fair&#x2010;copy manuscripts, both in the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref> and in the separate 
                        presentation copies of poems that were later bound in <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title></ref> and

                        (see, e.g., the <date when="1827-01-01">1 January 1827</date> pencil presentation copy, <ref type="witness" target="time_blank_verse_msia.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTIMEBLANKVERSE">&#x201C;Papa whats time a figure or a sense&#x201D;</title></ref>). 
                        Possible models for the &#x201C;double&#x2010;lettering&#x201D; include a display typeface used on title pages of <title type="series" corresp="#DOVESENGLISHCLASSICS">&#x201C;Dove&#x02BC;s English Classics&#x201D;</title> 
                        and a similar engraved lettering used on maps in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s geography book,

                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears to have derived his double&#x2010;lettering primarily from a serif model, 
                        but he may also have based it on the sanserif typefaces that began as a neoclassical revival in the <date notBefore="1780" notAfter="1789">1780s</date> 
                        and sprang into a variety of forms and associations in the first decades of the nineteenth century 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CRAMSIEGRAPHIC"><persName corresp="#PCRAMSIE">Cramsie</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#CRAMSIEGRAPHIC"><hi rend="italic">Story of Graphic Design</hi></title></ref>, 117&#x2013;18, 126&#x2013;27). 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> used these decorative printed letter forms until <date notBefore="1828" notAfter="1829">1828&#x2013;29</date>, when his lettering for many texts 
                        became notably smaller, though no less typographical in form&#x2014;the decrease in size perhaps owing to his increasing agility with pen and ink, which he was using by then, but perhaps also to imitating the smaller type in the adult books 
                        he was consuming by then.</p>
                    
                    <p>Double&#x2010;print lettering cost <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> a great deal of time and attention, as in the elaborate fair copy of the poem

                <p>As an example of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s letters to his father with embellished salutations and signtures 
                    that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> was describing, see the

                    As this and many other documents show, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did employ a &#x201c;copperplate&#x201d; cursive hand in the <date notBefore="1830-01-01" notAfter="1839-12-31">1830s</date>, 
                    especially for his fair&#x2010;copy poems and for some letters addressed to his father. <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02bc;s narrative is deficient, however, in supposing that 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was entirely and precociously self&#x2010;taught in his handwriting until required to imitate a copybook round hand, 
                    modeling the personality of his hand on his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName>&#x02BC;s mercantile writing. The narrative 
                    not only neglects to identify what precisely was precocious and self&#x2010;fashioning about his earliest hand as compared with male discipline &#x201c;under orders&#x201d; of copybook instruction; 
                    the story also fails even to pose questions about his mother&#x02bc;s teaching. <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> frames <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s education in writing 
                    as a Rousseauist and Wordsworthian binary of nature and culture that refuses even to take account of mothers as the primary mediators of the written word 
                    (&#x201c;there is some trace of teaching at the very start&#x201d;)&#x2014;a role that <persName corresp="#MMYERS">Mitzi Myers</persName> 
                    and others have worked to reinstate in histories of education and children&#x02BC;s literature.</p>
                
                <p>Even apart from its underlying ideological framework, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02bc;s argument appears skewed by the context of its publication. 
                    Remarking on variations in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s handwriting, 
                    <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> explains these using a sweeping claim about the &#x201c;chameleon&#x201d; quality of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s personality: 
                    &#x201c;For his mother he had another hand; for his friends and for himself an assortment of varying scribbles. 
                    But there, I think, comes out one of the leading points in his character. To be a man of strong thought and will, 
                    innovator in art, science, politics, morality, and religion, there never was such a chameleon, always ready to colour his mind 
                    after his surroundings; all things to all men&#x201d;

                    a nondenominational <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christian</orgName> magazine with Scottish connections. His observation about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s chameleon character&#x2014;besides seeming patently untrue&#x2014;likely played to 
                    the magazine&#x02bc;s ecumenical mission. (<title type="periodical" corresp="#GOODWORDS"><hi rend="italic">Good Words</hi></title> promised to enliven the dullness of English Sabbatarianism by extending the boundaries

                    As an account of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s handwriting, this polemical explanation is interesting 
                    as evidence connected with <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s reception around <date when="1900">1900</date>, the year of his death, 
                    but the approach seems to have prevented <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> from conveying effectively the intimate knowledge 
                    he must have gathered over the years about the physical family manuscripts, or thinking about that evidence in context of an early nineteenth&#x2010;century, middle&#x2010;class home education.</p>
                
                <p>One such benchmark was  
                    on the identify of the &#x201c;first written letter&#x201d;, see

                    From this point, as suggested in <ref type="internal" target="#COPYBOOK">The Ruskins and Copybook Self&#x2010;Culture</ref>, 
                    <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> may have appropriated control over this advance in <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02bc;s handwriting, treating it as a rite of passage for his son. 
                    But <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s use of pen and ink cannot be neatly compartmentalized, as <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> does in his version of the story, as the sudden adoption &#x201c;under orders&#x201d; 
                    of a male &#x201c;commercial&#x201d; round hand like his father&#x02bc;s. While <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02bc;s writing instruction prior to <date when="1827">1827</date> goes unmentioned 
                    in the family letters, his first cursive script (<date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1829">1827&#x2013;29</date>) appears to have been modeled on his mother&#x02bc;s.</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> probably learned to write in ink using a quill, if trade statistics for the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> 
                        provide a reliable guide. In <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> alone, imported goose quills consumed annually averaged around 20 million, 
                        and the country as a whole used about double that number. However, the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> 
                        also witnessed the mass production of steel pens&#x2014;referring to what nowadays is typically called the <hi rend="italic">nib</hi>, as opposed to the pen&#x2010;holder held in the hand&#x2014;and by <date when="1838">1838</date> this output increased to 220 million. In the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, 
                        manufacturers (chiefly in <placeName corresp="#BIRMINGHAM">Birmingham</placeName>) were improving the flexibility of pens as well producing them in quantities sufficient to lower their retail cost considerably. 
                        Even fountain&#x2010;pens were being patented, although not mass&#x2010;produced until the end of the century. These alternatives to the traditional quill became more affordable and widely used in the 
                        <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>. Quills of any kind were purchased already prepared or &#x201C;dressed&#x201D;; and as the huge consumption suggests, 
                        consumers typically were unskilled in mending a quill for extended use, or unwilling to take the trouble, 
                        preferring merely to discard a dull pen for a fresh one. Steel pens broke easily, but as they became cheaper (dropping from about eighteen shillings per dozen at the start of the century 
                        to about fourpence per gross by <date when="1838">1838</date>), these too could be painlessly discarded by the middle&#x2010;class writer

                        This manuscript originated as a fair copy of the poem, using an ink, print&#x2010;lettered hand similar in appearance to the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>, which is dated ca. <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1828">1827&#x2013;28</date> (books 1&#x2013;2).

                        Scottish burgh schools like the <orgName corresp="#RHSE">Edinburgh Royal High</orgName> in theory championed a democratic ideal 
                        of seating tradesmen&#x02BC;s sons alongside those of patricians, and fees were kept moderate. Nonetheless, the Ruskin family 
                        may have delayed in order to scrape together the means even for moderate fees, or <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s mother, <persName corresp="#CTWR">Catherine</persName>,

                        Even at the <orgName corresp="#RHSE">Edinburgh Royal High</orgName>, the writing and arithmetic classes had always been optional, the expectation being that many youths would acquire these accomplishments

                    <p>As a path to self&#x2010;cultivation, copybooks typically provided instructional texts (set in letterpress) along with illustrations of writing samples in various styles or <hi rend="italic">hands</hi> 
                        (reproduced from engraving or woodcut and, later, from lithograph). Subcategories of copybooks specialized in particular disciplines or audiences,

                        Most copybooks modeled the formal script known as <hi rend="italic">English round hand</hi> or <hi rend="italic">copperplate</hi>, for which 
                        an influential standard had been set by the copybook, <title type="manual_guide" corresp="#BICKHAMUNIVERSALPENMAN"><hi rend="italic">Universal Penman</hi></title> (<date notBefore="1733" notAfter="1741">1733&#x2013;41</date>),

                        round hand called for a looping style that accentuated contrasts of thin and thick strokes, a style related to the late eighteenth&#x2010;century transitional and modern typefaces 
                        that featured these extreme contrasts, such as Baskerville and Bodoni

                        In the eighteenth century, round hand settled into a practical but elegant script that was less elaborate than earlier versions, and that was widely used in business. 
                        In the view of a historian of calligraphy, the common English round hand was &#x201C;colourless, thoroughly unromantic, and dull&#x201D;; however, these &#x201C;were precisely 
                        the qualities which commended [the hand] to those who wrote our invoices and to those abroad who received them&#x201D;; and this &#x201C;plain hand for a plain purpose&#x201D; 
                        was typified in the nineteenth century by &#x201C;the books of <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName>&#x201D;, in which the hand became &#x201C;even more matter&#x2010;of&#x2010;fact and more standardised&#x201D;

                            The editors of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> repeat this characterization verbatim, in reprinting <persName corresp="#MRC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            &#x201C;Note&#x201D; respecting <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>; however, they effectively modify this characterization in a note appended to another section of the 
                            <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, the prose essay, <ref type="witness" target="chamouni_prose_msxi.php"><title type="essay" corresp="#JRCHAMOUNIPROSE">&#x201C;Chamouni&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                            which they speculate to have been copied in &#x201C;a lady&#x02BC;s hand (query&#x2014;his mother&#x02BC;s [i.e., <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s])&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 2:380 n. 1). This latter essay does not form part of the 23&#x2013;page section 
                            of fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>, but is written on two leaves (both sides of each) bound into <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSSXI">MS XI</title>, 
                            but the hand used for this fair copy appears identical to that used for the poems in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>. <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> 
                            and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> seem to acknowledge the identical hands by repeating <persName corresp="#MRC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s characterization of a 
                            &#x201C;female&#x201C; or &#x201C;lady&#x02BC;s hand, albeit dodging the implication of their &#x201C;query&#x02BC;&#x2014;that if <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> 
                            fair&#x2010;copied the item in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSSXI">MS XI</title>, then she also copied the times in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>.</p>
                    
                        <p>The hand is in fact markedly more elegant than <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s, although it does exhibit a few characteristics typical of both hers and 
                            <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hands, characteristics that are not found in <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s&#x2014;namely, a 
                            long medial <hi rend="italic">s</hi> as the first stroke of a double&#x2010;<hi rend="italic">s</hi>; and heavy reliance on the ampersand. One might be tempted to ascribe the hand 
                            to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>; however, as <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> point out more helpfully than in what 
                            they&#x02BC;ve so far contributed to the question, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hand is unquestionably responsible for an attribution and dateline that follow 
                            the prose essay in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSSXI">MS XI</title>, &#x201C;<persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">J.R.</persName> / fragment from a Journal / <date when="1833">1833</date>&#x201C;&#x2014;and 
                            this hand definitely contrasts with that of the transcription itself (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 2:380 n. 1).</p>
                        
                        <p>So we are left with <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName> or possibly another &#x201c;lady&#x201d; as a candidate.</p>
