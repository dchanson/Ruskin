                    in seating tradesmen&#x02BC;s sons alongside those of patricians, 
                    the Ruskin family probably needed extra time to scrape together money for the fees, or they may have been apprehensive of exposing <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> to a famously sadistic Latin master

                    imaginative space his reading has opened up&#x2014;without concluding that <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> once hoped to continue his studies at the university. 
                    Instead, his departure in <date when="1802">1802</date> for a mercantile life in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> compelled him to pursue self&#x2010;culture, 
                    which both his own determination and the intensifying print and visual culture of the era enabled him to support, first for himself and then for his family.</p>
                
                <p>Copybooks like <persName corresp="#EBD">Butterworth</persName>&#x02BC;s were designed to straddle the worlds of public instruction in schools and of private instruction in the home, whether by writing masters or by self&#x2010;guided practice. 
                    Even at the <orgName corresp="#RHSE">Edinburgh High School</orgName>, the writing and arithmetic classes had always been optional, the expectation being that many youths would acquire these accomplishments 
                    on their own by various means (see <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="butterworth_e_note.php"><persName corresp="#EDB">Edmund Butterworth</persName> (d. <date when="1814">1814</date>)</ref>). 
                    In an <date when="1825">1825</date> advertisement, the publisher <orgName corresp="#OANDB">Oliver &#x0026; Boyd</orgName> of <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName> characterizes 
                    <title type="manual_guide" corresp="#BUTTERWORTHYOUNGARITHMETICIAN"><hi rend="italic">Butterworth&#x02BC;s Young Arithmetician&#x02BC;s Instructor</hi></title> 
                    as &#x201C;designed for the Use of Schools and Private Families&#x201D;, by &#x201C;combining accurate Writing, correct Figures, and judicious Arrangement&#x201D;. 
                    Of the five productions by <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName> listed, the advertisement goes on to declare that &#x201C;[f]or beauty of design, and correctness of execution, 
                    these Works of Mr <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName> are admired by every competent judge of Penmanship. 
                    A decided preference is accordingly given to them by the most eminent Teachers in the <placeName corresp="#UK">United Kingdom</placeName>. 
                    They are the productions of an indefatigable genius in his profession, exercised and improved by the experience of above forty years.&#x2014;The 
                    demand for them continuing to increase, the Publishers have spared no expense in bringing them out in the superior style in which they now appear&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#OLIVERBOYDADVERTISEMENT">&#x201C;Books Published by Oliver &#x0026; Boyd&#x201D;</ref>, 21).</p>
                    
                <p>As a path to self&#x2010;cultivation, copybooks typically provided instructional texts (set in letterpress) along with illustrations of writing samples in various styles or &#x201C;hands&#x201D; 
                    (reproduced from engraving or woodcut and, later, from lithograph). Subcategories of copybooks specialized in particular disciplines or audiences, 
                    such as youths or ladies (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BECKERPRACTICEOFLETTERS"><persName corresp="#DPBECKER">Becker</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#BECKERPRACTICEOFLETTERS"><hi rend="italic">Practice of Letters</hi></title></ref>, xi). 
                    Most copybooks modeled the formal script known as <hi rend="italic">English round hand</hi> or <hi rend="italic">copperplate</hi>, 
                    which in the eighteenth century had settled into a practical but elegant script that was less elaborate than earlier versions, and that was widely used in business. 
                    An influential standard for English round hand was set by the copybook, <title type="manual_guide" corresp="#BICKHAMUNIVERSALPENMAN"><hi rend="italic">Universal Penman</hi></title> (<date notBefore="1733" notAfter="1741">1733&#x2013;41</date>), 
                    jointly authored by the engraver and writing master, <persName corresp="#GBE">George Bickham</persName> (<date notBefore="1684" notAfter="1758">1684&#x2013;1758</date>), and his son. Practiced using a pen with a flexible quill nib, 
                    round hand called for a looping style that accentuated contrasts of thin and thick strokes, a style related to the late&#x2010;eighteenth&#x2010;century transitional and modern typefaces 
                    that featured these extreme contrasts, such as Baskerville and Bodoni 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CRAMSIEGRAPHIC">Cramsie, <title type="book" corresp="#CRAMSIEGRAPHIC"><hi rend="italic">Story of Graphic Design</hi></title></ref>, 119&#x2013;21). 
                    In the view of a historian of calligraphy, the common English round hand was &#x201C;colourless, thoroughly unromantic, and dull&#x201D;; however, these &#x201C;were precisely 
                    the qualities which commended [the hand] to those who wrote our invoices and to those abroad who received then&#x201D;; and this &#x201C;plain hand for a plain purpose&#x201D; 
                    was typified in the nineteenth century by &#x201C;the books of <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName>&#x201D;, in which the hand became &#x201C;even more matter&#x2010;of&#x2010;fact and more standardised&#x201D;

                <p>The earliest extant sustained writing by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears in 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref> and

                    he wrote entirely in print lettering. The medium is graphite, for which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> probably would have used a porte&#x2010;crayon&#x2014;a metal holder for rods of plumbago&#x2014;or 
                    he might have used a cedar pencil. The plumbago used in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> was proudly mined in <placeName corresp="#BORROWDALE">Borrowdale</placeName>, 
                    where high quality deposits were carefully husbanded

                    The porte&#x2010;crayon is a typical object in eighteenth&#x2010;century genre paintings showing boys absorbed in drawing, 
                    such as works by the French artists <persName corresp="#JSC">Jean Sim&#x00E9;on Chardin</persName> (<date notBefore="1699" notAfter="1779">1699&#x2013;1779</date>),

                    who were concerned with conveying progressive educational ideas and with representing children as thoughtful, individualistic observers 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JOHNSONPICTURINGPEDAGOGY"><persName corresp="#DJOHNSON">Johnson</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#JOHNSONPICTURINGPEDAGOGY">&#x201C;Picturing Pedagogy&#x201D;</title></ref>).</p>
                
                <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> based his print lettering in part on models found in his favorite books. For example, in his adaptation of 
                    <persName corresp="#ME">Maria Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="lesson" corresp="#EDGEWORTHEARLYLESSONS"><hi rend="italic">Early Lessons</hi></title>,

                    he imitated the original&#x02BC;s title page; and his lettering generally suggests the influence of English transitional serif typefaces, such as Baskerville and Bulmer,  
                    and their predecessor, Caslon, which predominated in British books of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. 
                    Even in these first manuscripts, the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref>, however, 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> also flourished his lettering with decorative capitals that 
                    in the <date notBefore="1828-01-01" notAfter="1829-12-31">1828&#x2013;29</date> <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol3_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#HARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 3</title></ref>, 
                    he called &#x201C;double&#x201D; print. 
                    The style of this lettering appears based on the sanserif typefaces that began as a neoclassical revival in the <date notBefore="1780" notAfter="1789">1780</date>s 
                    and sprang into a variety of forms and associations in the first decades of the nineteenth century 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CRAMSIEGRAPHIC"><persName corresp="#PCRAMSIE">Cramsie</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#CRAMSIEGRAPHIC"><hi rend="italic">Story of Graphic Design</hi></title></ref>, 117&#x2013;18, 126&#x2013;27). 
                    One likely model for his &#x201C;double&#x201D; lettering was the largest, most prominent labeling used for maps in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s geography book,

                <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> probably learned to write in ink using a quill, if trade statistics for the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> 
                    provide a reliable guide. In <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> alone, imported goose quills consumed annually averaged around 20 million, 
                    and the country as a whole used about double that number. However, the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> 
                    also witnessed the mass production of steel pens, and by <date when="1838">1838</date> this output increased to 220 million. Also by the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, 
                    manufacturers were perfecting quill nibs for use in pen holders, 
                    and improvements in quill fountain&#x2010;pens were being patented. These alternatives to the traditional quill became more affordable and widely used in the 
                    <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>. Quills of any kind were purchased already prepared or &#x201C;dressed&#x201D;; and as the huge consumption suggests, 
                    consumers typically were unskilled in mending a quill for extended use, or unwilling to take the trouble, 
                    preferring merely to discard a dull pen for a fresh one

                <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early cursive hand more closely resembles the hand of his mother than that of his father, 
                    which is flamboyantly larger, more slanted, and extends long ascenders and descenders. (The contrast is vivid in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1, version of 
                    <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php"><title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</title></ref>, to which both <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> and <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> contributed 
                    fair copy.) It makes sense that a home&#x2010;schooled youth would imitate his mother&#x02BC;s hand, particularly in a household like the Ruskins&#x02BC;, 
                    from which the father was absent for protracted periods. Yet when learning to handle pen and ink, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> declared, according to his mother, 
                    &#x201C;that the thoughts of your [<persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s] being pleased encourages him&#x201D;, and <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> believed that &#x201C;the showing you his writing occupied his thoughts 
                    fully more than how he expressed his feelings&#x201D;

                    Examples of these first efforts from around <date when="1827-04">April 1827</date> include <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_jjr_1827-05">May 1827 letter</title> accompanying

                    (not the poem itself, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> copied in print lettering rather than cursive, albeit using a pen). An early example of cursive applied to a poem is found in

                    This version certainly predated the late <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1828">1827&#x2013;early 1828</date> <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair copy of the poem, albeit perhaps not by very long, and the hand is very awkward, but recognizably <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s; 
                    and the script appears to be in ink, although the medium can no longer be proven, since the RF T70 survives only as a photograph, so far as is known.</p>

                            of fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>, but is written on two leaves (both sides of each) bound into <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSSXI">MS XI</title>, 
                            but the hand used for this fair copy appears identical to that used for the poems in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>. <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> 
                            and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> seem to acknowledge the identical hands by repeating <persName corresp="#MRC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s characterization of a

                            fair&#x2010;copied the item in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSSXI">MS XI</title>, then she also copied the times in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>.</p>
                    
                        <p>The hand is in fact markedly more elegant than <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s, although it does exhibit a few characteristics typical of both hers and 
                            <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hands, characteristics that are not found in <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s&#x2014;namely, a
