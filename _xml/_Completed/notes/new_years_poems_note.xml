                <p>Two occasions that regularly call for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poetry to honor his father 
                    are <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s May 10 birthday and New Year&#x02BC;s. Of the latter kind of occasional poem, 
                    whether inscribed for presentation on New Year&#x02BC;s Eve or on New Year&#x02BC;s Day, the earliest surviving example is

                    (see also <ref type="apparatus" target="the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php#DISCUSSION"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHENEEDLESSALARM">&#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;</title>: Discussion</ref>,

                    <head type="section">The New Year&#x02BC;s Ode Tradition in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title></head>
                
                <p>A likely source for modeling the New Year&#x02BC;s ode, which was available to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in the <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName> library, 
                    was the <ref type="note" target="evangelical_magazine_note.php"><title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title></ref>, 
                    which regularly included New Year&#x02BC;s poems in the &#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; section for the January issue. Starting with the magazine&#x02BC;s volume 1 (<date when="1793">1793</date>), 
                    monthly issues featured a brief one&#x2010; to two&#x2010;page section entitled &#x201C;Poetry&#x201D;, consisting of contributions by readers, signed only with their initials, aliases, or home locations. 
                    These small &#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; sections, which were included in each monthly issue, may have served <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> as a model for his verse anthologies in his 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title></ref>, small collections that he entitled &#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; 
                    similarly to the header used for the collections in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> (see, e.g., 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">MS I Poetry Anthology</title></ref>).</p>
                
                <p>From the beginnings of the magazine, the editors encouraged readers to contribute to all departments, especially with &#x201C;short pieces&#x201D; such as poems 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PREFACEEVANGELICALMAG1794-01">&#x201C;Preface&#x201D; [<date when="1794-01">January 1794</date>]</ref>). 
                    Readers responded with verse in a variety of genres&#x2014;descriptive pieces, elegies, epigraphs, devotional poems, hymns, psalm paraphrases, reflections on Bible verses, 
                    doctrinal arguments, &#x201C;thing&#x201D; poems, as well as seasonal poems, including Christmas poems for the December issue, 
                    and New Year&#x02BC;s poems for the January issue. The final issue of volume one (<date when="1793-12">December 1793</date>) featured contributors&#x02BC; poems on the Nativity, 
                    while the opening issue of volume two (<date when="1794-01">January 1794</date>) presented contributors&#x02BC; poems on the New Year; and that pattern was sustained in subsequent volumes. 
                    In each annual volume, the New Year holiday appears to have invited more verse commentary compared to Christmas (and other holy days are rarely noticed at all). 
                    New Year&#x02BC;s poems are also often complemented with reflections in prose in other sections of the issue, as well. For example, in the <date when="1794-01">January 1794</date> issue, 
                    an essay urges readers to solemnize their minds &#x201C;when . . . brought <hi rend="italic">to the close of the year</hi>&#x201D; since, 
                    despite all &#x201C;sagacity&#x201d;, one &#x201C;cannot ascertain what events may befal me <hi rend="italic">in the progress of that upon which, at present, I am about to enter!</hi>&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SUITABLEMEDITATIONEVANGELICALMAG1794-01"><title type="essay" corresp="#SUITABLEMEDITATIONEVANGELICALMAG1794-01">&#x201C;Suitable Meditation for the Beginning of the Year&#x201D;</title></ref>, 29).</p>
                
                    <p>The New Year&#x02BC;s poems are religious, like almost all of the poetry published in the magazine, and they tend to develop predictable themes&#x2014;for example, the 
                        shortness of time in which to live a holy life; praise of the <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#CREATOR">Creator</persName> for time and the seasons; 
                        the superiority of spiritual gifts over material holiday presents. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s New Year&#x02BC;s poems do not typically reflect these religious and admonitory themes.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>One of the first New Year&#x02BC;s poems, featured in the January issue of volume two, was authored by a writer using the pen name <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName>&#x2014;a contributor 
                        included among the magazine&#x02BC;s first poets in volume one, and continuing as a reliable presence for years afterward, leading one to speculate that 
                        the writer may have been a member of the editorial staff, perhaps one among the twenty&#x2010;four Ministers from multiple denominations who founded the magazine 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ALIQUISNEWYEAREVANGELICALMAG1794-01"><persName corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName>, <title type="poem" corresp="#ALIQUISNEWYEAREVANGELICALMAG1794-01">&#x201C;The New Year&#x201D;</title></ref>). 
                        <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName> went on to supply a New Year&#x02BC;s poem annually for almost four decades, the poet&#x02BC;s last ode being published in <date when="1832">1832</date>. 
                        The earlier New Year&#x02BC;s poems by <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName>, similarly to those contributed by other poets to the January issues, are lyric &#x201C;reflections&#x201D; and &#x201C;thoughts&#x201D; of a speaker, 
                        looking back on one&#x02BC;s shortcomings in the preceding year and resolving to do better in the coming year. Some of <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName>&#x02BC;s earlier efforts stand out from the couplets and quatrains 
                        that typify the other poems, by aspiring to formal complexity with a six&#x2010;line stanza that alternates quatrameter rhyming couplets in lines 1&#x2013;2 and 4&#x2013;5 with rhyming trimeter lines 3 and 6. 
                        Then, with the New Year&#x02BC;s poem for <date when="1804">1804</date>&#x2014;notably, the year of the &#x201C;Great Terror&#x201D;, when British citizens watched with horror 
                        as <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName> massed troops and a flotilla on the French coast of the <geogName corresp="#ENGLISHCHANNEL">English Channel</geogName>, in preparation for invasion&#x2014;<persName corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName> expanded the poem from a lyric reflection into an ode, 
                        consisting of three divisions of thought subtitled &#x201C;Reflection&#x201D;, &#x201C;Contrition&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Praise&#x201D;&#x2014;each section composed using distinct metrical patterns
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ALIQUISODEFORTHENEWYEAREVANGELICALMAG1804-01"><persName type="pen_name" corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName>, <title type="poem" corresp="#ALIQUISODEFORTHENEWYEAREVANGELICALMAG1804-01">&#x201C;Ode for the New Year&#x201D;</title></ref>; 
                        on the &#x201C;Great Terror&#x201D;, see <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="the_defiance_of_war_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEDEFIANCEOFWAR">&#x201C;The Defiance of War&#x201D;</title></ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p><persName type="pen_name" corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName> goes on to elaborate this ode structure in New Year&#x02BC;s poems for subsequent January issues through <date when="1832">1832</date>, 
                        most laid out in this ambitious multipart format. Accordingly, for those January issues, <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName>&#x02BC;s ode either fills the entirety 
                        of the normally modest one&#x2010; to two&#x2010;page monthly allotment to poetry or it bursts the limits, allowing for contributions by others, as well, to occupy several pages of anthology. 
                        Presumably, in order to have been showcased on this scale, <persName corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName>&#x02BC;s niche performance was welcomed as a holiday tradition by the magazine&#x02BC;s editors and readers. 
                        Thus, while nothing is known of <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#ALIQUIS">Aliquis</persName>&#x02BC;s identity, this poet&#x02BC;s career perhaps presents an example of an amateur poet of moderate skill who achieved modest fame within a pious and respectable circle&#x2014;a 
                        possible way of viewing <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s career, had he stayed on his path of writing verse for the annuals.</p>

             <!--   <p>When this family tradition started is uncertain. The earliest poem specifically

                    three New Year&#x02BC;s Poems: <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTIMEBLANKVERSE">&#x201C;Time: Blank Verse,&#x201D;</title>
                    the previous year&#x02BC;s presentation, along with <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESUN">&#x201C;The
                        Sun&#x201D;</title> and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D;
                    (&#x201C;Papa how pretty those icicles are&#x201D;)</title>. </p>
                <p>Typically the poems contained a New Year&#x02BC;s greeting, but
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Papa how pretty those
                    icicles are&#x201D;)</title> does not, suggesting that the relevance of a given
                    topic to the holiday may have been understood only by the family.</p>
                <p>One possible model for this practice was the Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s
                    annual, containing light verse and illustration, such as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi>.[When did the family start buying
                    annuals? Point out how anthologies following &#x201C;Harry and
                    Lucy&#x201D; may be imitating this.] </p>
                <p> For a Scottish family, New Year&#x02BC;s Day . . . (What was the
                    celebration typically? Why New Year&#x02BC;s?) Ruskin would always treat
                    New Year&#x02BC;s as a red&#x2010;letter day connected with writing. . . .</p>
