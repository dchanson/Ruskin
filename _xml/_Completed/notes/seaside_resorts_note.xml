                <p>The Ruskins frequented seaside resorts during <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s youth, which coincided with a period of expansion for coastal settlements 
                    that could provide amenities for visitors seeking health and recreation through sea bathing. The growth in fashionable seaside resorts 
                    began in the eighteenth century as an extension of the established season for inland spas such as <placeName corresp="#CITYOFBATH">Bath</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#TUNBRIDGEWELLS">Tunbridge Wells</placeName>. 
                    In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, seaside resorts prospered by the incursion of the professional and well&#x2010;to&#x2010;do 
                    merchant classes, like the Ruskins, into what had been primarily the pleasures and benefits of the elite. As Londoners, the Ruskins patronized the resorts within easy reach 
                    along the southeast coast, such as <placeName corresp="#SANDGATE">Sandgate</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName> 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT"><persName corresp="#JKW">Walton</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT"><hi rend="italic">The English Seaside Resort</hi></title></ref>, 6&#x2013;9, 20, 48).</p>
                
                <p>The Ruskins also took advantage of the inland mineral&#x2010;spring spas, especially <placeName corresp="#TUNBRIDGEWELLS">Tunbridge Wells</placeName>.

                    was a physician at <placeName corresp="#TUNBRIDGEWELLS">Tunbridge Wells</placeName> from <date when="1853">1853</date> until his retirement in <date when="1868">1868</date>. In <date when="1841">1841</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was sent to take the water cure at <placeName corresp="#LEAMINGTON">Leamington Spa</placeName>, which,
                    according to <persName corresp="#JKW">Walton</persName>, was exceptional as a late bloomer among <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>&#x02BC;s inland spas when the public was being drawn increasingly to the seaside

                    <p>In <date when="1819-06">June 1819</date>, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> &#x201C;rejoiced&#x201D; that her husband, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>, was considering sea bathing, 
                        but she advised caution. He should &#x201C;try cautiously the sea&#x201D;, &#x201C;tak[ing] but one plunge 
                        come out instantly rub yourself perfectly dry and if you should feel no cold nor headake try it again 
                        at the interval of the day&#x201D;. If this experiment made him &#x201C;sensible of benefit&#x201D;, 
                        <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> urged, then <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> should &#x201C;stay [at] the seaside as long as business will permit&#x201D; in order to strengthen his health 
                        (<ref type="apparatus" target="mr_to_jjr_1819-06-23_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="#mr_to_jjr_1819-06-23">Margaret to John James Ruskin, <date when="1819-06-23">23 June 1819</date></title></ref>, <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 95). 
                        <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s advice closely mirrors a passage of text found in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BUCHANDOMESTICMEDICINE1791"><title type="book" corresp="#BUCHANDOMESTICMEDICINE1791"><hi rend="italic">Domestic Medicine</hi></title></ref> 
                        by the <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName> physician, <persName corresp="#WBUCHAN">William Buchan</persName> (<date notBefore="1729" notAfter="1805">1729&#x2013;1805</date>).</p>

                        &#x201C;Cautions concerning Cold Bathing, and Drinking the Mineral Waters&#x201D;,  <persName corresp="#WBUCHAN">Buchan</persName> concedes that 
                        &#x201C;it is now fashionable for persons of all ranks to plunge into the sea, and drink the mineral waters&#x201D;. He therefore 
                        undertakes to provide &#x201C;hints or cautions&#x201D; since &#x201C;imprudent use&#x201D; of these treatments have caused 
                        &#x201C;many lives . . . [to be] lost, and numbers [to have] ruin[ed] their health&#x201D;. Among those who &#x201C;ought to be cautious in using the cold bath&#x201D; and yet 
                        &#x201C;who stand peculiarly in need of the bracing qualities of cold water&#x201D; are &#x201C;nervous&#x201D; people, including 
                        &#x201C;a great number of the male, and almost all the female inhabitants of great cities&#x201D;. Lest these urban denizens 
                        cause themselves harm in striving to allay their nervous disease, <persName corresp="#WBUCHAN">Buchan</persName> advises that, 
                        &#x201C;[f]or them, . . . the best plan would be to accustom themselves to it [cold bathing] 
                        by the most pleasing and gentle degrees&#x201D;. The recommended method, which <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> repeats to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>, is 
                        to take &#x201C;one immersion at a time&#x201D; and get &#x201C;rubbed dry the moment&#x201D; of coming &#x201C;out of the water&#x201D; and then 
                        &#x201C;continue to take exercise for some time after&#x201D;. After this trial, immersions may be repeated 
                        only if the bather is not afflicted by &#x201C;chilness, loss of appetite, listlessness, pain of the breast or bowels, 
                        a prostration of strength, or violent head&#x2010;achs&#x201D;

                    <p><persName corresp="#WBUCHAN">Buchan</persName> had fewer reservations about exposing youths to sea water: &#x201C;To young people, and particularly to children, 
                        cold bathing is of the last importance. Their lax fibres render its tonic powers peculiarly proper. It promotes their growth, 
                        increases their strength, and prevents a variety of diseases incident to childhood&#x201D;

                        remained widely popular as a household medical reference in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#USA">America</placeName> for a century (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROSENBERGMEDICALTEXT"><persName corresp="#CEROSENBERG">Rosenberg</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#ROSENBERGMEDICALTEXT">&#x201C;Medical Text and Social Context&#x201D;</title></ref>, 22). 
                        Starting with the eighteenth edition (<date when="1803">1803</date>), the last edition revised by the author, the chapter &#x201C;Cautions concerning Cold Bathing, and Drinking the Mineral Waters&#x201D; 
                        was replaced by a more extensive analysis of cold&#x2010;bathing and mineral waters (see 
                        <title type="book" corresp="#BUCHANDOMESTICMEDICINE1805"><hi rend="italic">Domestic Medicine</hi></title> [1805], xii, 576&#x2013;77). 
                        In her advice to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> appears to have consulted an earlier edition. 
                        The commentary on sea bathing contained in the only book attributed to <persName corresp="#WBUCHAN">Buchan</persName> that the Ruskins have been directly documented as owning, 
                        <title type="book" corresp="BUCHANCOTTAGEPHYSICIAN"><hi rend="italic">The Cottage Physician</hi></title>, does not correspond to <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s advice to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>. 
                        This book, however, which was first published in <date when="1825">1825</date>, is not by <persName corresp="#WBUCHAN">Buchan</persName> at all. The title page alleges the editorship of &#x201C;<persName corresp="#WBUCHAN">W. Buchan</persName>, M.D., and the members of a private medical society&#x201D;, 
                        but the manual consists of a farrago of medical advice excerpted from various publications. The commentary on sea bathing is attributed to a &#x201C;Dr. Robertson&#x201D; (pp. 209&#x2013;14).

                    <head type="section">The Ruskins at Seaside Resorts</head>
                    <p>By the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, many seaside resorts had sprung up along the southern and southeastern coast of <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>, as well as elsewhere in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>. 
                        Besides the salubrity of sea bathing, which they could all claim, the resorts offered a wide range of amenities. 
                        One characteristic that evidently factored into the Ruskins&#x02BC; choice among resorts 
                        was their respectability along with (or in spite of) their novelty. In <date when="1819">1819</date>, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> made his trial of sea&#x2010;bathing 
                        at <placeName corresp="#WEYMOUTH">Weymouth</placeName>, doubtless in part because he happened to have business in <placeName corresp="#SOUTHAMPTON">Southampton</placeName> at the time 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd, ed.</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 95). 
                        <placeName corresp="#WEYMOUTH">Weymouth</placeName> was also eminently respectable, even prestigious, having been patronized by the court of <persName corresp="#KG3">George III</persName>.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the last decade of the eighteenth century, the king was prescribed sea bathing to guard against a relapse of his madness. 
                        <placeName corresp="#WEYMOUTH">Weymouth</placeName> was chosen, since it was already the site of a lodge belonging to his brother, <persName corresp="#WHDG">Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester</persName> (<date notBefore="1743" notAfter="1805">1743&#x2013;1805</date>). 
                        The town was thus assured a place among the most fashionable seaside resorts, along witih <placeName corresp="#BRIGHTON">Brighton</placeName>, which was favored by the Prince Regent. 
                        According to an <date when="1815">1815</date> guidebook to spas and resorts, whereas <placeName corresp="#WEYMOUTH">Weymouth</placeName> was once &#x201C;small and meanly built&#x201D;, it had become &#x201C;within the last twenty or thirty years&#x201D;&#x2014;that is, 
                        since the advent of royal residence&#x2014;a city of &#x201C;rapid enlargements, and many elegant buildings, . .  a very respectable place&#x201D;. 
                        The guidebook notes that royal patronage persisted with the residence of <persName corresp="#CAUGUSTA">Charlotte</persName>, the popular Princess of Wales (<date notBefore="1796" notAfter="1817">1796&#x2013;1817</date>), 
                        who spent a summer at Gloucester Lodge and had promised to return. (Instead, by the time of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s visit to Weymouth, 
                        <persName corresp="#CAUGUSTA">Charlotte</persName> was mourned by the nation.) According to historical statistical measures of elite status among seaside resorts, 
                        <placeName corresp="#WEYMOUTH">Weymouth</placeName> did continue to rank high and grow fast in the first third of the century 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JFELTHAM"><persName corresp="#JFELTHAM">Feltham</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JFELTHAM"><hi rend="italic">Guide to All the Watering and Sea&#x2010;Bathing Places</hi></title></ref>, 490&#x2013;91; <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT"><persName corresp="#JKW">Walton</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT"><hi rend="italic">The English Seaside Resort</hi></title></ref>, 12, 77&#x2013;78).</p>

                    <p><placeName corresp="#WEYMOUTH">Weymouth</placeName>&#x02BC;s royal associations would have appealed to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>,

                        to living for a time in the comparatively &#x201C;shabby&#x201d; seacoast town of <placeName corresp="#DYSART">Dysart</placeName> by the prospect of &#x201C;a number of Gentlemans seats close beside it,

                        <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> would have been reassured by <placeName corresp="#WEYMOUTH">Weymouth</placeName>&#x02BC;s marketing of respectability, as suggested 
                        by the guidebook&#x02BC;s invoking of <persName corresp="#CAUGUSTA">Princess Charlotte</persName>&#x2014;a code meant, perhaps, to disassociate <placeName corresp="#WEYMOUTH">Weymouth</placeName> 
                        from the moral stigma that clung to <placeName corresp="#BRIGHTON">Brighton</placeName> owing to its connection with <persName corresp="#CAUGUSTA">Charlotte</persName>&#x02BC;s prodigal father, <persName corresp="#KG4">George IV</persName>. 
                        Nonetheless, <placeName corresp="#WEYMOUTH">Weymouth</placeName>&#x02BC;s fashionableness may have seemed a cut above the Ruskins&#x02BC; status; and in any case, 
                        the southern coastal resorts may have required too lengthy a journey for a short summer holiday. 
                        It is telling that, for their first visit to a resort as a family, the Ruskins chose <placeName corresp="#SANDGATE">Sandgate</placeName>, 
                        a comparatively small, modest, and even unnoticed place. As late as the decades around the turn of the twentieth century,
                        <placeName corresp="#SANDGATE">Sandgate</placeName> ranked only one hundreth in population among the nation&#x02BC;s resorts (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT"><persName corresp="#JKW">Walton</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT"><hi rend="italic">The English Seaside Resort</hi></title></ref>, 65).</p>
                    
                    <p>The holiday in <placeName corresp="#SANDGATE">Sandgate</placeName> must have occurred in summer <date when="1821">1821</date>, since <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> reflected on the excursion in <date when="1822-01">January 1822</date>. 
                        She looked back on it fondly, framing the visit in terms of homeliness: &#x201C;I hope . . . we shall be permitted to enjoy our home and english comforts 
                        [in the coming months] and if we are to travel it may only be on such journey as our Sandgate one&#x201D;. 
                        Even <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> at age three considered <placeName corresp="#SANDGATE">Sandgate</placeName> as the standard for what was &#x201C;fine and . . . beautiful&#x201D;, comparing its pleasures 
                        favorably to the stone rolling and stick gathering to be had on <placeName corresp="#DUPPASHILL">Duppas Hill</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#CROYDON">Croydon</placeName>

                        At about the time of their visit, <placeName corresp="#SANDGATE">Sandgate</placeName>, according to the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JFELTHAM"><title type="book" corresp="#JFELTHAM"><hi rend="italic">Guide to All the Watering and Sea&#x2010;Bathing Places</hi></title></ref>, 
                        was &#x201C;a very pretty village&#x201D;, which had &#x201C;suddenly and deservedly started into notice as a watering place&#x201D;. 
                        It could boast &#x201C;neither a ball nor assembly room&#x201D; like nearby <placeName corresp="#DOVER">Dover</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#FOLKESTONE">Folkestone</placeName>, or <placeName corresp="#HYTHE">Hythe</placeName>, but for the Ruskins 
                        the point probably was that &#x201C;the lovers of dancing&#x201D; would gravitate to those resorts, leaving the family to quiet walks on the cliffs, 
                        commanding a prospect of the French coast; to exploring an Elizabethan castle, its fortress &#x201C;lately . . . converted into a martello tower&#x201D;, 
                        a reminder of the contest with Napoleonic <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>; and to taking advantage of a &#x201C;good circulating library&#x201D; and &#x201C;lodgings . . . on reasonable terms&#x201D; (p. 423).</p>
                    
                    <p>For what became the Ruskins&#x02BC; most favored seaside resort, however, they evidently sought quiet and respectability combined with somewhat grander pretensions.</p>

                        <p>Quoting this pronouncement a decade later in <date when="1815">1815</date>, the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JFELTHAM"><title type="book" corresp="#JFELTHAM"><hi rend="italic">Guide to All the Watering and Sea&#x2010;Bathing Places</hi></title></ref> deemed the statement fitting, 
                            but presents <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName> as equivocally poised between decline from its prosperous past as a trading, fishing, and shipbuilding center and its ambition for its rebirth as a tourist resort. 
                            While acknowledging the town&#x02BC;s strong suit in its impressive history and romantic landscape, this guidebook description harps on losses: 
                            &#x201C;The present is a new town; the old one having been swallowed up by an inundation&#x201D;, and the coast continues to erode; 
                            <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName> &#x201C;had formerly a good harbour&#x201D;, which has lain in ruin since Elizabethan times; &#x201C;trade . . . is inconsiderable, 
                            compared to what it once enjoyed&#x201D;, though the boat builders continue to maintain a &#x201C;high reputation&#x201D;; and with &#x201C;only one inn, properly so called&#x201D;, 
                            &#x201C;accommodations and attendance are frequently subjects of complaint&#x201D;. Yet <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName> &#x201C;every year . . . seems to obtain fresh accessions of visitors&#x201D;, 
                            and development is underway: &#x201C;the promenade lately obtained . . . is a great improvement&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JFELTHAM"><persName corresp="#JFELTHAM">Feltham</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JFELTHAM"><hi rend="italic">Guide to All the Watering and Sea&#x2010;Bathing Places</hi></title></ref>, 317, 318, 319, 320&#x2013;21, 316). Whatever merit may have been warranted by these judgments, 
                            the assessment at least attests to an ancient coastal town striving to transform its economy 
                            from traditional but declining maritime occupations to modern tourism servicing the rising middle class.</p>
                        
                        <p>This entrepreneurial activity may have been what intrigued the Ruskins&#x2014;particularly <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x2014;when they visited <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName>, probably for the first time in <date when="1826">1826</date>. 
                            The <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> was a peak decade for <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName> as a resort (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT"><persName corresp="#JKW">Walton</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT"><hi rend="italic">The English Seaside Resort</hi></title></ref>, 58). 
                            Taking advantage of the rising tide of fashion for seeking health and pleasure at the seaside, 
                            the town was turning to account its decayed advantages as a port and fishery, able to offer the kind a beachfront well adapted for bathing&#x2014;a 
                            wide coastal frontage with a gentle declivity for easy access to the sea. The town could also parlay resources 
                            appealing to a broader range of tourist engagement. The area was rich with historical asssociations, 
                            and its landscape was both picturesque and interesting to naturalists. 
                            Such variety and flexibility of touristic appeal, <persName corresp="#JKW">Walton</persName> argues, gave seaside resorts an edge over the older inland spas, 
                            which had little besides their mineral springs to recommend them. Also, unlike the traditional spas 
                            with their rigid social codes, the seaside resorts welcomed children (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT"><title type="book" corresp="#WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT"><hi rend="italic">The English Seaside Resort</hi></title></ref>, 
                            106&#x2013;7, 16&#x2013;17, 42&#x2013;43, 217). As characterized in the letterpress for <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#COOKESOUTHERNCOAST"><title type="book" corresp="#COOKESOUTHERNVIEWS"><hi rend="italic">Picturesque Views on the Southern Coast of England</hi></title></ref> (<date notBefore="1814" notAfter="1826">1814&#x2013;26</date>), 
                            &#x201C;<placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName>, as a public watering&#x2010;place . . . may boast the charm of uniting social and elegant pleasure with rural tranquillity&#x201d; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#COOKESOUTHERNCOAST"><persName corresp="#WBCOOKE">W. B. Cooke</persName> and <persName corresp="#GCOOKE">G.

                        <p>To package the emerging resort industry of <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName> with its picturesque and historical resources, artistic and antiquarian enterprises 
                            featured the town in publications of the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>. The most ambitious work focused on <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName> particularly was an <date when="1824">1824</date> illustrated history, 
                            <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MOSSHASTINGS"><title type="book" corresp="#MOSSHASTINGS"><hi rend="italic">The History and Antiquities of the Town and Port of Hastings</hi></title></ref>, 
                            written and illustrated by <persName corresp="#WGMOSS">W. G. Moss</persName> (dates unknown). As &#x201C;draughtsman to His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge&#x201D;, 
                            <persName corresp="#WGMOSS">Moss</persName> created the topographical, architectural, and antiquarian drawings, on which the engravings were based. 
                            The work was published by subscription, listing numerous royal subscribers, headed by <persName corresp="#KG4">George IV</persName>. 
                            The attention thus garnered for <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName> may have helped the town to build a case for an elite clientele. 
                            Thus, notwithstanding the declaration by the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HASTINGSGUIDE1804"><title type="book" corresp="#HASTINGSGUIDE1804"><hi rend="italic">Hastings Guide</hi></title></ref> 
                            that the town set itself apart from resorts that harbored morally disreputable pleasures, 
                            <persName corresp="#WGMOSS">Moss</persName>&#x02BC;s stately work indicates how a bid for patronage by the late&#x2010;Georgian aristocracy could be accommodated along with appeal to the evanglical middle class. 
                            As <persName corresp="#JKW">Walton</persName> remarks, the visiting public at the resorts was formed from a &#x201C;complex pattern of demand&#x201D;, 
                            woven from &#x201C;differing visiting publics, aristocratic and commercial . . . centered on the metropolis&#x201D;, and reflecting a 
                            &#x201C;wide range of social attributes, attitudes and expectations, which could be subsumed under each [social] label&#x201D;, including 
                            &#x201C;many shades of religious commitment&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT"><title type="book" corresp="#WALTONENGLISHSEASIDERESORT"><hi rend="italic">The English Seaside Resort</hi></title></ref>, 14). A spectrum of desirably polite but moral society could be cultivated 
                            with the aid of an intelligent and appealing print and visual culture.</p>
                        
                        <p><persName corresp="#WGMOSS">Moss</persName>&#x02BC;s work perhaps more accurately reflects the appeal of a watering place like <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName> to as a middle&#x2010;class family in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, 
                            as compared with a grander illustrated publication such as the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#COOKESOUTHERNCOAST"><title type="book" corresp="#COOKESOUTHERNVIEWS"><hi rend="italic">Picturesque Views on the Southern Coast of England</hi></title></ref>, which reached its conclusion in <date when="1826">1826</date>. 
                            The latter was a scheme by the engravers <persName corresp="#WBCOOKE">William Bernard Cooke</persName> (<date notBefore="1778" notAfter="1855">1778&#x2013;1855</date>) and his brother <persName corresp="#GCOOKE">George Cooke</persName> (<date notBefore="1781" notAfter="1834">1781&#x2013;1834</date>) to employ several artists, 
                            chiefly <persName corresp="#JMWT">J. M. W. Turner</persName>, in producing watercolor drawings of coastal scenes to be engraved and published in parts. In <date when="1811">1811</date>, when the Cookes first floated 
                            the idea with <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>, the scheme was novel, since most English topographical works were devoted to the country&#x02BC;s interior. The ambitious project was delayed by quarrels and professional setbacks, however, 
                            and when it reached its final collected form in <date when="1826">1826</date>, many expectations had been thwarted, including a spin&#x2010;off project to be entitled 
                            &#x201C;Views at Hastings and Its Vicinity&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SHANESTURNERSRIVERS"><persName corresp="#ESHANES">Shanes</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#SHANESTURNERSRIVERS"><hi rend="italic">Turner&#x02BC;s Rivers, Harbours, and Coasts</hi></title></ref>, 6, 9 and 5&#x2013;12 passim). The letterpress, also a disappointment, was originally prepared 
                            by <persName corresp="#WC">William Combe</persName> (<date notBefore="1742" notAfter="1823">1742&#x2013;1823</date>), best known for <title type="poem" corresp="#COLLINSDRSYNTAX">The Tour of Doctor Syntax, in Search of the Picturesque</title> (<date when="1812">1812</date>), 
                            illustrated by <persName corresp="TR">Thomas Rowlandson</persName> for the publisher <persName corresp="#RAP">Rudolph Ackermann</persName>. For the collected <date when="1826">1826</date> volumes, <persName corresp="#TR">Combe</persName>&#x02BC;s text was revised by <persName corresp="#BHOFLAND">Barbara Hofland</persName> (<date notBefore="1770" notAfter="1844">1770&#x2013;1844</date>), 
                            the children&#x02BC;s writer, whose spouse was a landscape artist. Updating the letterpress, <persName corresp="#BHOFLAND">Hofland</persName> highlighted several of the seacoast locations as having achieved 
                            popularity for bathing and seaside recreation&#x2014;<placeName corresp="#MARGATE">Margate</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#RAMSGATE">Ramsgate</placeName>, <placeName corresp="HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#BRIGHTON">Brighton</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#WEYMOUTH">Weymouth</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#LYME">Lyme</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#TEIGNMOUTH">Teignmouth</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#COMBEMARTIN">Comb&#x2010;Martin</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#LYNEMOUTH">Lynemouth</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#MINEHEAD">Minehead</placeName>&#x2014;but 
                            the emphasis was at variance with the engravings, few of which foregrounded such activities. <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s scenes in particular, on which the success of the publication depended, 
                            exclude signs of modern tourism.

                            when he chuses to exert it, in delineating animate as well as inanimate nature&#x201D;. Otherwise, the foregrounds of <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s coastal scenes are occupied
