                <head type="title">The System of Title Citation for Manuscripts</head>
                <p>The Apparatus Page for each manuscript begins with a section, &#x201C;Title,&#x201D; which discusses the name of that manuscript&#x2014;a more or less complicated topic, 
                    depending on how many naming systems have been applied to the manuscript in question. The most familiar system historically, 
                    and therefore the one adopted most pervasively in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> for hyperlinking purposes, 
                    derives from <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s bibliographical practice in 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (<date when="1891">1891</date>)</title></ref>.
                    Another system derives from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own practices of naming the manuscripts, whether in youth or old age. 
                    Because neither of these practices was consistent and comprehensive, the traditions of naming the manuscripts require to be supplemented.
                </p>
                <p>In youth, when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was working with his manuscripts, his names for them tended to be either generic&#x2014;as 
                    in the term <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK"><hi rend="italic">red book</hi></title></ref>, 
                    which applied to a class of small, reddish&#x2010;brown bound notebooks used for the earliest juvenilia&#x2014;or derived 
                    from a work contained in the manuscript. For example, in <date when="1829-03">March 1829</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote to his father: 
                    &#x201C;I am trying to get that red book of mine which has the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">Monastery</title> in it finished, by the time you come home,&#x201D; 
                    referring both to <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref> and to 
                    a work, <ref type="apparatus" target="monastery_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title></ref>, included in the notebook. 
                    The work, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> versification of the novel by <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>, is not the most prominent piece contained in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK">Red Book</title>, 
                    but it happened to be uppermost in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> mind at the time.
                </p>
                <p>In many of the initially blank, bound notebooks and ledgers that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> typically used to draft or fair copy his work&#x2014;he 
                    also used loose sheets of paper, or pamphlets folded and sewn by hand 
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="overview_of_mss_note.php">Overview of Manuscripts</ref>)&#x2014;he dedicated the notebook initially to a major work, 
                    for which he devised a decorated title page. 
                    For example, <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref>, 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref>, and 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msiiia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIIIA">MS IIIA</title></ref>, begin with volumes 1, 2, and 3, 
                    respectively, of <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;.</title> Presumably, in these cases, 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> referred to the manuscript by the title of its major work, using that title interchangeably 
                    for the text of the work and for the physical manuscript witnessing its fair copy. 
                    Thus, when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> announces in a <date when="1832-01-14">14 January 1832</date> letter that <title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title> is at last finished, quite copied in, fairly dismissed,&#x201D; 
                    and that he has &#x201C;put such a finis&#x201D; with &#x201C;innumerable flourishes with which it is decorated and the paper loaded 
                    you would think there never was to be a beginning of that end,&#x201D; he clearly means that he has &#x201C;copied in&#x201D; the work, 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="iteriad_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title></ref>, into the bound notebook that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> would later designate as 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msvii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title></ref>, and &#x201C;decorated&#x201D; and &#x201C;loaded&#x201D; the &#x201C;paper&#x201D; of the physical object in order to celebrate 
                    completion of the text of the poem. The title <title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title> applied equally to the text of the poem and to its fair&#x2010;copy manuscript.
                </p>
                <p>Such coterminous titles could not have been stable, however. We do not know what <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> called the notebook containing the fair copy of 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="iteriad_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title></ref> when, over time, he subjected this notebook, 
                    like so many of his manuscripts, to additional uses. In this case, he followed 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="iteriad_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title></ref> in 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msvii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title></ref> with a fair copy of a new, but never&#x2010;completed epic poem, 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="athens_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title></ref>. Later, still more works were fair&#x2010;copied into this ledger. 
                    Titles of manuscripts could shift with their uses. The handmade pamphlet now known as 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title></ref> shows &#x201C;Vol 1&#x201D; scrawled on the top right corner of its first recto.
                    The designation appears as an afterthought, inserted into a space next to the title of the first poem 
                    of this little anthology. What the name of the manuscript means is obscure: other, complementary &#x201C;volumes&#x201D; may have existed, 
                    but it is just as likely that the pamphlet only temporarily occupied the position of first in a putative series that remained only an idea.
                </p> 
                <p>Titles could also be kept deliberately open&#x2010;ended. On the first blank recto of the notebook now known as <ref type="apparatus" target="msv_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title></ref>, 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote the heading, <title type="anthology" corresp="#MISCELLANEOUSPOETRY">&#x201C;Miscellaneous Poetry,&#x201D;</title> and numbered this recto as page 1. As a title for the anthology of poems contained in the notebook, 
                    <title type="anthology" corresp="#MISCELLANEOUSPOETRY">&#x201C;Miscellaneous Poetry&#x201D;</title> became intriguingly coterminous for both the text of the anthology and for the physical notebook containing the text, 
                    when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName> inserted below <persName corresp="#JR">John&#x02BC;s</persName> title the attribution, 
                    &#x201C;By <persName corresp="#JR">J. Ruskin</persName> from 10 years to 11 to 12 to [. . .] of age&#x201D;&#x2014;the ellipsis representing a gap that <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> left to be filled in, 
                    as the anthology progressed. Thus, the collaborative title&#x2014;along with the text of the anthology&#x2014;remained open&#x2010;ended, 
                    as the text advanced toward the physical limits 
                    of the notebook that defined the scope of the anthology. <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> never completed his portion of the title 
                    because <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> never filled the notebook&#x2014;the unpunctuated 
                    final line, &#x201C;Away and away,&#x201D; of the last poem added to the anthology trailing off into the blankness of remaining pages.
                </p>
                <p>Even when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> usage of a title is documented consistently over time, 
                    the evidence may be unclear to what the title refers. 
                    In letters of <date when="1832">1832</date> and <date when="1835">1835</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> mentioned his <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MINERALOGICALDICTIONARY">&#x201C;mineralogical dictionary,&#x201D;</title> 
                    and both the title and (roughly) the dates of composition held good decades later, 
                    when in <date when="1864">1864</date> <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> referred to having &#x201C;written a <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MINERALOGICALDICTIONARY"><hi rend="italic">Mineralogical Dictionary</hi></title>,&#x201D; 
                    for which he &#x201C;invented a shorthand symbolism for crystalline forms, 
                    before [he] was fourteen&#x201D;. Again, in <date when="1875">1875</date>, in <title type="book" corresp="#JRDEUCALION"><hi rend="italic">Deucalion</hi></title>, he wanted readers to know that he 
                    &#x201C;began when . . . only twelve years old, a <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MINERALOGICALDICTIONARY"><hi rend="italic">Mineralogical Dictionary</hi></title>, 
                    written in a shorthand composed of crystallographic signs now entirely unintelligble to me.&#x201D; 
                    Finally, in <date when="1885">1885</date> in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, he remembered that his &#x201C;fifteenth birthday gift&#x201D; of <title type="book" corresp="#SASSUREVOYAGES"><hi rend="italic">Voyages dans les Alpes</hi></title>, 
                    by <persName corresp="#HBS">Horace B&#x00E9;n&#x00E9;dict de Saussure</persName>, assisted him in &#x201C;carrying on [his] <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MINERALOGICALDICTIONARY">mineralogical dictionary</title>&#x201D;

                    (Another example of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> exhibiting different ideas at different times about his early manuscripts is his docketing of some of the

                <p>Perhaps owing to an awareness of these ambiguities, or perhaps just for the sake of simplicity,

                    The primary purpose of this descriptive bibliography was to explain and justify a chronological order of the manuscripts, 
                    supplying a &#x201C;justification of the hypothetical dates assigned to some of the poems&#x201D;

                    the editors accounted for manuscripts that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> had omitted by inserting new descriptions 
                    and designating them with a Roman numeral plus an English alphabet letter. 
                    In this way, the editors attempted to maintain <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</persName> chronological order, inserting the new item into its appropriate place in the numerical order 
                    Thus, for example, they inserted <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title></ref> and 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msib_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIB">MS IB</title></ref> between the manuscripts that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> had numbered

                <p><persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</persName> aim of representing a chronological order of manuscripts 
                    could never have achieved more than an approximation of the manuscripts&#x02BC; sequence, since several of the bound manuscripts overlap one another 
                    in the chronological range of their contents. His sequence is also erroneous in parts owing to misdating of some manuscripts. 
                    Most problematically, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> decided from the start to omit from the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Note&#x201D;</title> those manuscripts containing exclusively prose, 
                    as these seemed to him irrelevant to the project of editing the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> (<date when="1891">1891</date>)</ref>.
                    Presumably, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> intended ultimately to supply a corresponding nomenclature for manuscripts to be included in a complementary edition of the
                    early prose, but this project never came to pass  
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="history_of_bibliography_and_editing_note.php">History of Bibliography and Editing of the Early Manuscripts</ref>). 
                    As a result, arbitrary and misleading limitations were built into the scope of <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</persName> <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE_BIBLIOGRAPHY">bibliography</title>, 
                    confusions that <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> perpetuated by confining their revision of <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</persName> <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Note&#x201D;</title> to manuscripts containing poetry,

                    The prose manuscripts are assigned discursive titles, rather than Roman numerals, such as &#x201C;Sermon Book (<date when="1827">1827</date>),&#x201D; <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MINERALOGICALDICTIONARY">&#x201C;Mineralogical Dict.</title> (<date when="1831">1831</date>)&#x201D;, and

                </p>
                <p>One solution to this complexity would be to scrap <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</persName> nomenclature, and start anew with a corrected and comprehensive system, 
                    but this drastic move would cause unnecessary confusion. 
                    More than a century&#x02BC;s accumulation of scholarship has relied on the nomenclature in <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</persName> <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Note&#x201D;</title> as expanded in the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>. 
                    Moreover, the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Note&#x201D;,</title> however faulty, retains considerable historical interest, as <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> compiled it when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was still alive; 
                    and while the ill and elderly <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> is unlikely to contributed in any extensive way to this descriptive bibliography, 
                    one cannot discount the possibility that the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Note&#x201D;</title> conveys some of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> own
                    ideas about the preservation and classification of these manuscripts. 
                    Even if <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> played no part at all in <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</persName> editing of the

                    the involvement of the fin de si&#x00E8;cle <orgName corresp="#BRANTWOODCI">Brantwood circle</orgName> in the project is just as significant.

                    Roman&#x2010;numeral scheme of chronological sequence; for example,

                    and she situates it following <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title>, another handmade pamphlet with sermon content, and which <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> had included in his original <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Note&#x201D;.</title>
                </p>
                <p>Reverential of <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> as <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> was, she recognized that his original <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Note&#x201D;</title> contained dating errors; 
                    and so in order to preserve his Roman&#x2010;numeral nomenclature, while also correcting, yet remaining faithful to the spirit of his chronological ordering of manuscripts, 
                    <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> layered a Roman&#x2010;numeral <hi rend="italic">re</hi>ordering over top of <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</persName> original Roman&#x2010;numeral designations. 
                    Thus, &#x201C;Dating MSS. of Boyhood&#x201D; proposes a sequence identifying manuscripts as follows:
                    <list type="ordered">
                        <item n="1">I. MS No. I</item>
                        <item n="2">II. MS No. IA</item>
                        <item n="3">III. MS No. III</item>
                        <item n="4">IV. MS No. IIIA</item>
                        <item n="5">V. MS No. II</item>
                        <item n="6">VI. MSS Nos. IIA, B, C, D, E</item>
                        <item n="7">VII. MS No. IV</item>
                    </list>
                    And so on, in which the first Roman numeral in a given entry represents <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen&#x02BC;s</persName> attempt a chronological reordering, 
                    while the second (the manuscript number per se) is drawn either from <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</persName> original scheme or represents <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen&#x02BC;s</persName> insertion 
                    of a manuscript into that scheme. (<persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> wanted nothing to do with <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</persName> insertions, so she ignored their assignation of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">&#x201C;MS IA&#x201D;</title> 
                    to the collection of manuscripts that they bound under that name, and instead assigned <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">&#x201C;MS IA&#x201D;</title> to the manuscript of <title type="book" corresp="#JRPUPPETSHOW">&#x201C;The Puppet Show&#x201D;</title>, which <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> 
                    called <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIB">&#x201C;MS IB&#x201D;.</title>)
                </p>
                <p>Whatever the other merits of <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen&#x02BC;s</persName> &#x201C;Dating MSS. of Boyhood,&#x201D; her solution for naming and numbering manuscripts fails to lend clarity to what 
                    was already a losing proposition of ordering objects linearly that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did not use in that fashion. 
                    He protracted use of some manuscripts over several years, 
                    and he overwrote others, building up layers of chronological sequence within a given manuscript. 
                    Fortunately, electronic publication provides alternatives to linear ordering 
                    (see <ref type="note" target="plan_of_archive_note.php">Plan of the Archive</ref>).
                </p>
                <p>As for <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</persName> and <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen&#x02BC;s</persName> accretions of manuscript designations to <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</persName> <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Note&#x201D;,</title> 
                    the practice in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> is, in any case, to document fully as possible the history of naming manuscripts and works in the &#x201C;Title&#x201D; sections 
                    of apparatuses, while for hyperlinking purposes to use short titles for which a clear trail exists in bibliography and scholarship. 
                    Therefore, manuscripts are designated by Roman numeral if they were assigned one either in <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Note&#x201D;,</title> 
                    or in <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</persName> revision of the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Note&#x201D;</title> for the

                    Since <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen&#x02BC;s</persName> additional Roman&#x2010;numeral designations (and even <hi rend="italic">re</hi>designation, in one case) were never published, 
                    <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> prefers the short discursive titles established in <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</persName> <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE_BIBLIOGRAPHY">bibliography</title> (III.B.<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), 
                    titles that typically are also reflected in the provenance of modern bindings, sales catalogs, and library catalogs for the collections that ultimately 
                    preserved these manuscripts.
