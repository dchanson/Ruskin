                <p>In <date when="1825">1825</date>, when <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> was six, the Ruskin family made its first visit to the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName>. 
                    According to <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName>, the family party included <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s nurse, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="strachan_anne_note.php"><persName corresp="#ASB">Anne Strachan</persName></ref>, who accompanied the family also on the <date when="1833">1833</date> Continental journey. 
                    <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> adds that they journeyed between <date notBefore="1825-05-11" notAfter="1825-07-13">11 May and 13 July</date>, 
                    and the itinerary covered <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#BRUGES">Bruges</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#GHENT">Ghent</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName>, including <placeName corresp="#VERSAILLES">Versailles</placeName>

                    As such, the tour was characteristically <date notBefore="1799-11-09" notAfter="1815-06-18">post&#x2010;Napoleonic</date>, organized around paying tribute to the Allies&#x02BC; victory on <placeName corresp="WATERLOO">Waterloo Field</placeName>
                    and witnessing the festivities in <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName> to celebrate the crowning of <persName corresp="#KC10">Charles X</persName>&#x2014;the successor to <persName corresp="#KL18">Louis XVIII</persName> 
                    who died in <date when="1824">1824</date>.</p>
                
                <p>The route through <placeName corresp="#BRUGES">Bruges</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#GHENT">Ghent</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> was that taken by <persName corresp="#GGB">Lord Byron</persName>, when embarking on his exile in <date when="1816">1816</date> 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HAWKINSBYRONCHRONOLOGY"><persName corresp="#ARHAWKINS">Hawkins</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#HAWKINSBYRONCHRONOLOGY">&#x201C;The Byron Chronology&#x201D;</title></ref>, years <date notBefore="1816" notAfter="1819">1816&#x2013;19</date>).</p>
                
                <p>The coronation of <persName corresp="#KC10">Charles X</persName> was the first since the restoration of the <orgName corresp="#BOURBONMONARCHY">Bourbon monarchy</orgName>&#x2014;<persName corresp="#KC10">Charles</persName>&#x02BC;s brother, <persName corresp="#KL18">Louis XVIII</persName>, 
                    having died less than a decade after being restored to the throne following the Allies&#x02BC; victory. The ceremony itself took place on <date when="1825-05-29">29 May 1825</date> at the <placeName type="building" corresp="#REIMSCATHEDRAL">cathedral</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#REIMS">Reims</placeName>, 
                    where French monarchs had for centuries traditionally been anointed, and not in <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName>, where <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName> had crowned himself emperor in <placeName type="building" corresp="#NOTREDAMEPARIS">Notre Dame</placeName>. 
                    While some aspects of the ceremony were updated to take account of political conditions in the Restoration, &#x201C;the overriding symbolism was that of the pre&#x2010;<date when="1789">1789</date> monarchy, 
                    with pride of place being given to the clergy and nobility&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PRICEPERILOUSCROWN"><persName corresp="#MPRICE">Price</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#PRICEPERILOUSCROWN"><hi rend="italic">Perilous Crown</hi></title></ref>, 119). 
                    In <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>, where <persName corresp="#KC10">Charles</persName> had lived in exile in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName>, 
                    theaters staged replicas of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#REIMSCATHEDRAL">Reims Cathedral</placeName> ceremony; and in <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName>, 
                    opera houses mounted productions that reflected the spectacle at <placeName corresp="#REIMS">Reims</placeName>, which was in itself deemed by many to be inappropriately operatic in character 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WALTONQUELQUE"><persName corresp="#PHW">Walton</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#WALTONQUELQUE">&#x201C;&#x2018;Quelque peu th&#x00E9;&#x00E2;tral&#x2019;&#x201D;</title>, 6&#x2013;10</ref>).</p>
                
                <p>In his travel diary for <date when="1833">1833</date>, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> reflected back on this <date when="1825">1825</date> journey, 
                    comparing the family&#x02BC;s experiences during the much more ambitious Continental <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1833_note.php">Tour of <date when="1833">1833</date></ref>. 
                    On this present visit, he notes that <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName> was &#x201C;not so gay as in <date when="1825-05">May 1825</date>&#x201D;

                    Following the <date notBefore="1830-07-26" notAfter="1830-07-29">July Revolution of 1830</date> and the abdication of <persName corresp="#KC10">Charles X</persName>, as a historian remarks, 
                    &#x201C;a coronation for <persName corresp="#KLP1">Louis Philippe</persName> was never raised&#x201D;, even in the tempered form of medievalism surrounding <persName corresp="#KC10">Charles X</persName>&#x02BC;s ceremony, 
                    &#x201C;and the bourgeoisie&#x02BC;s king contented himself with his proclamation by the <orgName corresp="#CHAMBEROFDEPUTIESFRANCE">Chamber of Deputies</orgName> and the swearing of an oath 
                    of fidelity to the <title type="law" corresp="#1814CHARTERFRANCE">Constitutional Charter</title> as his sole inaurgural rite&#x201D;

                    In his autobiography, <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA">Praeterita</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> acknowledged that the trip was prompted by the coronation festivities, but he remembered nothing of the pomp, 
                    claiming to have been &#x201C;only interested by things near me, or at least clearly visible and present&#x201D;, such as the good&#x2010;natured servants at the <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName> hotel 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"> <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 35:104).</p>
                
                <p>A journey to the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName> may seem ambitious for a middle&#x2010;class <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> family, only recently established (since <date when="1823">1823</date>) in their new suburban home, 
                    <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName>, and with a young boy to raise and educate. By the <date notBefore="1825" notAfter="1829">mid&#x2010;1820s</date>, however, 
                    <geogName corresp="#ENGLISHCHANNEL">Channel</geogName> crossings were common, if limited to the nearby and comparatively inexpensive destination of the <placeName corresp="#NETHERLANDS">Kingdom of the Netherlands</placeName> 
                    (<placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName> did not secede and form a nation until <date when="1830">1830</date>). Trips expressly to view the <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName> battlefield
                    had been popular since as early as the weeks immediately following the battle. The popularity had been enhanced by personal visits paid by such well&#x2010;known literary figures as 
                    <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>, <persName corresp="#RS">Robert Southey</persName>, and <persName corresp="#GGB">Lord Byron</persName>
