                <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drew on English, Scottish, and German sources for fairy lore.</p>
                <p>For Scottish sources, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> could consult <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="anthology" corresp="#SCOTTMINSTRELSY"><hi rend="italic">Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</hi></title>, 
                    which the Ruskins owned in the third edition (<date when="1806">1806</date>). He was probably also familiar with legend&#x2010;filled works by <persName corresp="#JH">James Hogg</persName>, 
                    such as <title type="anthology" corresp="#HOGGTHEQUEENSWAKEDELUXE"><hi rend="italic">The Queen&#x02bc;s Wake</hi></title>, which the Ruskins must have possessed since <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> ranked among the chief subscribers 
                    to a proposed deluxe edition of the work (ultimately never produced), when they were personally introduced to the writer in <date when="1832">1832</date>. 
                    The family were likely familiar with other works by <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>, as well. 
                    (See <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">The Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, 308 [2418], 160 [1277&#x2013;78]; and see <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="hogg_james_note.php"><persName corresp="#JH">James Hogg</persName> [ca. <date notBefore="1770" notAfter="1835">1770&#x2013;1835</date>]</ref>.) 
                    Some of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s knowledge must also have been traditional, learned from his parents and from the family his father&#x02bc;s sister,

                <p>In <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>, book 4, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> catalogues Scottish supernatural beings by kind. While he describes their attributes with too little detail 
                    to lend clues to his source, <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s scholarly introductions in the <title type="anthology" corresp="#SCOTTMINSTRELSY"><hi rend="italic">Minstrelsy</hi></title> supply a starting point.</p>

                        <item n="1"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Fairies and elves</hi></hi>&#x2014;<persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> uses these terms interchangeably. 
                            His introductory essay in the <title type="anthology" corresp="#SCOTTMINSTRELSY"><hi rend="italic">Minstrelsy</hi></title> on fairy lore is too long and various to summarize in detail, 
                            but an essential passage on the &#x201c;Fairies of <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>&#x201d; describes them &#x201c;as a diminutive race of beings, of a mixed, 
                            or rather dubious nature, capricious in their dispositions, and mischievous in their resentment. They inhabit the interior of green hills, 
                            chiefly those of a conical form, . . . , on which they lead their dances by moon&#x2010;light; impressing upon the surface the mark of circles, 
                            which sometimes appear yellow and blasted, sometimes of a deep green hue; and within which it is dangerous to sleep, or to be found after sun&#x2010;set&#x201d;. 
                            Sometimes, however, they &#x201c;reside in subterranean abodes, in the vicinity of human habitations&#x201d;, where they &#x201c;establish an intercourse 
                            with men, by borrowing and lending&#x201d;. Their &#x201c;usual dress . . . is green; though, on the moors, . . . heath&#x2010;brown, or in weeds dyed with stoneraw, or lichen&#x201d;. 
                            Their weapons are &#x201c;elf&#x2010;shot&#x201d; formed from &#x201c;elf&#x2010;arrow heads&#x201d;, associated with prehistoric flint points. They mine and shape 
                            the rocky landscape, and rounded stones in brooks are called &#x201c;fairy cups and dishes&#x201d;. &#x201c;They often ride in invisible procession, 
                            when their presence is discovered by the shrill ringing of their bridles&#x201d; and also &#x201c;are addicted . . . to the pleasures of the chace&#x201d;. 
                            But their &#x201c;most formidable attribute&#x201d; is the &#x201c;practice of carrying away, and exchanging, children&#x201d;, and also &#x201c;stealing human souls from their bodies&#x201d;

                        <item n="2"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Brownies</hi></hi>&#x2014;Belonging to "a class of beings, 
                            distinct in habit and disposition from the freakish and mischievous elves", the brownie exists as a solitary being, 
                            "meagre, shaggy, and wild in his appearance". "In the day time, he lurked in remote recesses of the old houses which he delighted to haunt; 
                            and, in the night, sedulously employed himself in discharging any laborious task which he thought might be acceptable 
                            to the family, to whose service he had devoted himself". The "Scottish Brownie", however, "does not drudge 
                            from the hope of recompense", but "on the contrary, so delicate is his attachment, 
                            that the offer of reward, but particularly of food, infallibly occasions his disappearance for ever" 
                            (Scott, Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, 1:xcix, c-ci). In the 1820s, brownie characters were popularized by the prose 
                            tale, The Brownie of Bodsbeck (1818), by <!-- ref note -->James Hogg (1770-1835); and the poem "The Brownie of Blednoch" 
                            by William Nicolson (1782-1849), available, e.g., in The Popular Rhymes of Scotland, collected by Robert Chambers (1826)   
                            (Henderson, &#x201C;Folk Belief and Scottish Traditional Literatures&#x201D;, 32). 
                            Hogg's tale, to which Ruskin alludes in "The Emigration of the Sprites", ends with a rational explanation of the brownie, 
                            who turns out to be human, a Covenanter in hiding.</item>
                        <item n="3"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">The water kelpie</hi></hi>&#x2014;To do the work of describing this spirit, 
                            Scott relies on a modern ballad composed as a "specimen of Scottish writing" in the manner of "our ancient bards", 
                            transmitting "the superstitions of the vulgar" in "the county of Angus". According to Scott's note, 
                            the ominous spirit that rises from the River Esk can be in the shape of a man or a horse. In the poem, 
                            it is part-man, part-fish, covered with shells, and composed of rushes and sedges for hair, mussels for eyes, all entwined with eels, 
                            newts, and other writhing creatures, and a torrent issuing from its wide mouth. It knows the fatal spot of those destined to be drowned, 
                            and "'With ruefow cries, that rend the skies, / Thair fate I seem to mourn, / . . . / Douce [i.e., sober], cautious men aft fey are seen; / 
                            Thai rin as thai war heyrt [i.e., furious], / Despise all reid, and court their deid [i.e., death]; / By me are thai inspir't'". 
                            Scott glosses <hi rend="italic">fey</hi> at length as "affording presages of approaching death, by acting a part directly the reverse of their proper character" 
                            (Scott, Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, 3:383-98).</item>
                    </list>
                
                <p>Scott distinguishes these sorts of spirits, which formed an "attachment . . . supposed to be local, and not personal", 
                    haunting "the rock, the stream, the ruined castle, without regard to the persons or families to whom the property belonged", 
                    from "spirits, to whom . . . is ascribed the guardianship, or superintendance of a particular clan, or family of distinction" 
                    (Scott, Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, 1:civ). To the latter class belongs the White Lady of Scott's novel, 
                    The Monastery. Her protection over the Avenel family dominates the episodes that Ruskin selected for his versification of the novel, 
                    "The Monastery". In the preface to the Magnum Opus edition of the novel, Scott links "these demons", which "announced 
                    good or evil fortune to the families connected with them", with "the beautiful, though almost forgotten, theory of astral spirits, 
                    or creatures of the elements"--"the elements of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water"--who surpass "human beings in knowledge and power, 
                    but [are] inferior to them as being subject . . . to a death which is to them annihilation, as they have no share in the promise 
                    made to the sons of Adam" (Caledonian edition, 17:xviii, xvii). The debt to Byron's Manfred is obvious, which Ruskin seems also 
                    to have felt (although he composed his version, "The Monastery", prior to publication of the Magnum Opus edition of The Monastery), 
                    in that, for him, the allure of White Lady resonates with the spell of the Witch of the Alps.</p>
