                <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drew on English, Scottish, and German sources for fairy lore.</p>
                <p>For Scottish sources, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> could consult <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="anthology" corresp="#SCOTTMINSTRELSY"><hi rend="italic">Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</hi></title>, 
                    which the Ruskins owned in the third edition (<date when="1806">1806</date>). He was probably also familiar with legend&#x2010;filled works by <persName corresp="#JH">James Hogg</persName>, 
                    such as <title type="poem" corresp="#HOGGTHEQUEENSWAKE"><hi rend="italic">The Queen&#x02bc;s Wake</hi></title>, which the Ruskins must have possessed since <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> ranked among the chief subscribers 
                    to a proposed deluxe edition of the work (ultimately never produced), when they were personally introduced to the writer in <date when="1832">1832</date>. 
                    The family were likely familiar with other works by <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>, as well. 
                    (See <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">The Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, 308 [2418], 160 [1277&#x2013;78]; and see <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="hogg_james_note.php"><persName corresp="#JH">James Hogg</persName> [ca. <date notBefore="1770" notAfter="1835">1770&#x2013;1835</date>]</ref>.) 
                    Some of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s knowledge must also have been traditional, learned from his parents and from the family his father&#x02bc;s sister, 
                    <persName corresp="#JRP">Janet (&#x201c;Jessie&#x201d;) Richardson</persName>.</p>
                <p>In <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>, book 4, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> catalogues Scottish supernatural beings by kind. While he describes their attributes with too little detail 
                    to lend clues to his source, <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s scholarly introductions in the <title type="anthology" corresp="#SCOTTMINSTRELSY"><hi rend="italic">Minstrelsy</hi></title> supply a starting point.</p>
                
                    <list type="ordered">
                        <item n="1"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Fairies and elves</hi></hi>&#x2014;<persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> uses these terms interchangeably. 
                            His introductory essay in the <title type="anthology" corresp="#SCOTTMINSTRELSY"><hi rend="italic">Minstrelsy</hi></title> on fairy lore is too long and various to summarize in detail, 
                            but an essential passage on the &#x201c;Fairies of <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>&#x201d; describes them &#x201c;as a diminutive race of beings, of a mixed, 
                            or rather dubious nature, capricious in their dispositions, and mischievous in their resentment. They inhabit the interior of green hills, 
                            chiefly those of a conical form, . . . , on which they lead their dances by moon&#x2010;light; impressing upon the surface the mark of circles, 
                            which sometimes appear yellow and blasted, sometimes of a deep green hue; and within which it is dangerous to sleep, or to be found after sun&#x2010;set&#x201d;. 
                            Sometimes, however, they &#x201c;reside in subterranean abodes, in the vicinity of human habitations&#x201d;, where they &#x201c;establish an intercourse 
                            with men, by borrowing and lending&#x201d;. Their &#x201c;usual dress . . . is green; though, on the moors, . . . heath&#x2010;brown, or in weeds dyed with stoneraw, or lichen&#x201d;. 
                            Their weapons are &#x201c;elf&#x2010;shot&#x201d; formed from &#x201c;elf&#x2010;arrow heads&#x201d;, associated with prehistoric flint points. They mine and shape 
                            the rocky landscape, and rounded stones in brooks are called &#x201c;fairy cups and dishes&#x201d;. &#x201c;They often ride in invisible procession, 
                            when their presence is discovered by the shrill ringing of their bridles&#x201d; and also &#x201c;are addicted . . . to the pleasures of the chace&#x201d;. 
                            But their &#x201c;most formidable attribute&#x201d; is the &#x201c;practice of carrying away, and exchanging, children&#x201d;, and also &#x201c;stealing human souls from their bodies&#x201d;

                            distinct in habit and disposition from the freakish and mischievous elves&#x201d;, the brownie exists as a solitary being, 
                            &#x201c;meagre, shaggy, and wild in his appearance&#x201d;. &#x201c;In the day time, he lurked in remote recesses of the old houses which he delighted to haunt; 
                            and, in the night, sedulously employed himself in discharging any laborious task which he thought might be acceptable 
                            to the family, to whose service he had devoted himself&#x201d;. The &#x201c;Scottish Brownie&#x201d;, however, &#x201c;does not drudge 
                            from the hope of recompense&#x201d;, but &#x201c;on the contrary, so delicate is his attachment, 
                            that the offer of reward, but particularly of food, infallibly occasions his disappearance for ever&#x201d;

                            <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02bc;s tale, to which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> alludes in <title type="poem" corresp="#JREMIGRATIONOFSPRITES">&#x201c;The Emigration of the Sprites&#x201d;</title>, ends with a rational explanation of the brownie,

                        <item n="3"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">The water kelpie</hi></hi>&#x2014;To do the work of describing this spirit, 
                            <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> relies on a modern ballad composed as a &#x201c;specimen of Scottish writing&#x201d; in the manner of &#x201c;our ancient bards&#x201d;, 
                            transmitting &#x201c;the superstitions of the vulgar&#x201d; in &#x201c;the county of <placeName corresp="#ANGUS">Angus</placeName>&#x201d;. According to <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s note, 
                            the ominous spirit that rises from the <geogName corresp="#RIVERESK">River Esk</geogName> can be in the shape of a man or a horse. In the poem, 
                            it is part&#x2010;man, part&#x2010;fish, covered with shells, and composed of rushes and sedges for hair, mussels for eyes, all entwined with eels, 
                            newts, and other writhing creatures, and a torrent issuing from its wide mouth. It knows the fatal spot of those destined to be drowned, 
                            and &#x201c;&#x2018;With ruefow cries, that rend the skies, / Thair fate I seem to mourn, / . . . / Douce [i.e., sober], cautious men aft fey are seen; / 
                            Thai rin as thai war heyrt [i.e., furious], / Despise all reid, and court their deid [i.e., death]; / By me are thai inspir&#x02bc;t&#x2019;&#x201d;.

                    haunting &#x201c;the rock, the stream, the ruined castle, without regard to the persons or families to whom the property belonged&#x201d;, 
                    from &#x201c;spirits, to whom . . . is ascribed the guardianship, or superintendance of a particular clan, or family of distinction&#x201d;

To the latter class belongs the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WHITELADY">White Lady</persName> of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s novel, 
                    <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY"><hi rend="italic">The Monastery</hi></title>. Her protection over the Avenel family dominates the episodes that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> selected for his versification of the novel,

                    but [are] inferior to them as being subject . . . to a death which is to them annihilation, as they have no share in the promise

The debt to <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="poem" corresp="#BYRONMANFRED"><hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi></title> is obvious, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> seems also 
                    to have felt (although he composed his version, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>, prior to publication of the <title type="series" corresp="#SCOTTMAGNUM">Magnum Opus</title> edition of <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY"><hi rend="italic">The Monastery</hi></title>),
