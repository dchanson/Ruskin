                    described in the sale catalogue&#x02BC;s title as the

                    This sale was perhaps the single most consequential event for the provenance of the early manuscripts.</p>

                        <p>The first 109 lots of the sale contained items from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s library, 
                            of which more than half (lots 24&#x2013;83) was devoted to the <title type="archive" corresp="#GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">&#x201C;<persName corresp="#CKG">Kate Greenaway</persName> Collection from Brantwood&#x201D;</title>, 
                            while the remainder ranged from illuminated manuscripts and incunabula to modern first editions and presentation copies. 
                            <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> must have anticipated that the <title type="archive" corresp="#GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">Greenaway collection</title> would command interest, 
                            having devoted four of the six plates in the illustrated catalogue to drawings from her books, 
                            as compared with only two plates showing <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts. 
                            The expectation was justified, as indicated by a copy of the sale catalogue at the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke Library</orgName> 
                            that was annotated by an observer. Almost every lot in <title type="archive" corresp="#GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">Greenaway collection</title> found a buyer, 
                            with the highest price of &#x00A3;420 paid for a collection of autograph letters from <persName corresp="#CKG">Greenaway</persName> to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>.</p>
                        
                        <p>Among the books unrelated to <persName corresp="#CKG">Greeanway</persName>, a copy of <persName corresp="#WBP">William Blake</persName>&#x02BC;s illustrated edition of

                            while other lots either were left unsold or their buyers unrecorded by the annotator. For example, the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke</orgName> copy of the catalogue 
                            fails to note at least two items of incunabula as well as two lots of Walter Scott novels that, 
                            according to James S. Dearden, were purchased by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="whitehouse_j_h_note.php"><persName corresp="#JHW">J. H. Whitehouse</persName></ref>

                                                although admittedly the reference is rather deeply buried in the bibliography volume 
                                                (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 38:206). 
                                                The catalogue describes the notebooks as a group: &#x201C;74&#x2013;84&#x2013;84 pp. containing geological, historical and grammatical notes, 
                                                half roan, 6 &#x00D7; 4 in.&#x201D; This summary of the contents credibly, if only roughly, corresponds to the Latin grammar, mineralogy, travel itineraries, and sermon drafts in fact 
                                                contained in these manuscripts. The material &#x201C;half roan&#x201D; is incorrect, however&#x2014;the notebooks being full roan, like the

                                                only very roughly approximates the 44 leaves, 42 leaves, and 43 leaves respectively found in them, as follows. The catalogue may afford a clue, however, that a 
                                                leaf now missing from the third of these notebooks was still attached at the time of the sale, since that possibility would account for the catalogue&#x02BC;s identical

                            it was the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts reserved for the second half of the sale that commanded the highest prices, 
                            according to the notations in the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke</orgName> copy of the catalogue. 
                            Prices ranged from &#x00A3;440 for the manuscript of <title type="book" corresp="#JRSTONESOFVENICE"><hi rend="italic">The Stones of Venice</hi></title>, 
                            to &#x00A3;520 for a collection of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s letters to his father, 
                            to &#x00A3;1,600 for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s diaries. 
                            The Stones manuscript and the diaries were acquired by Whitehouse, who spent a total of &#x00A3;2,089 at the sale, 
                            thus assuring that his collection, Dearden writes, held "its position at the head of Ruskin collections" 
                            (Ruskin, Bembridge and Brantwood, 55).</p>
                        
                        <p>Whitehouse had competitors, however, who adopted an alternative strategy to seeking high-profile items such as the diaries and manuscripts 
                            of the better-known Ruskin works. The Boston bookseller and collector, Charles E. Goodspeed, 
                            who had long been supplying American collectors with Ruskin first editions, had previously "found no competition" in London 
                            for the hundreds of Ruskin items beyond the typical antiquarian dealer's core of first-edition (or earlier edition) volumes of 
                            Modern Painters, Seven Lamps, and Stones (Goodspeed, Yankee Bookseller, 263; 
                            and see <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="goodspeed_charles_note.php"><persName corresp="#CG">Charles E. Goodspeed</persName> [<date notBefore="1867" notAfter="1950">1867&#x2013;1950</date>]</ref>). 
                            Goodspeed took the same approach at the 1930 Sotheby's sale, assisted by B. F. Stevens and Brown as his agent. 
                            Whereas Whitehouse's manuscript acquisitions were canonical by the standards of the time--the diaries, 
                            the Stones manuscript, and lot 119, which was headed by manuscript for Ruskin's Turner Catalogue--Goodspeed 
                            targeted very early and very late works: for example, manuscripts of <title type="story" corresp="#JRTHEKINGOFTHEGOLDENRIVER"><hi rend="italic">King of the Golden River</hi></title> (lot 114, &#x00A3;155), 
                            a portion of Fors Clavigera (lot 118, &#x00A3;50), and Praeterita (&#x00A3;155). His strategy is consistent with the biographical bias 
                            animating collectors of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, who aspired to comprehensive ownership 
                            of every published item by their modern authors of choice, from juvenilia to last works (see 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.php">The Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</ref>; and see

                        <p>In his 1937 autobiography, Goodspeed mentions that he acquired the King, Fors, and Praeterita manuscripts, 
                            and that he kept the Praeterita manuscript for himself, selling the other two 
                            (Yankee Bookseller, 267). Evidence at the Beinecke Library shows that his buyer for the King and Fors manuscripts was Yale University Library, 
                            and that the transfer was quick, sold in early November 1930. Evidence also reveals that Goodspeed's agent acquired additional manuscripts on his behalf at the 1930 sale, 
                            which, although Goodspeed fails to mention the items in his autobiography, he also sold to Yale University Library on the same date:

                        <p><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> turned these items around to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> for a total of &#x0024;3,000. 
                            Curiously, in what appears to be the earliest published report describing acquisitions by <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> 
                            from the <date when="1930-07">July 1930</date> Sotheby's sale, the items sold to the library by <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> 
                            are not mentioned. Instead, in a detailed <date when="1931-01">January 1931</date> report in the Yale University Library Gazette, 
                            it was lots 110 and 112, the six bound volumes of Ruskin family letters and the six slipcases containing juvenilia, that are celebrated as forming 
                            &#x201C;a considerable portion of the Brantwood collection of Ruskin manuscripts&#x201D; that is "now preserved for all time against sale and spoliation" 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#COLLECTIONRUSKINMANUSCRIPTS"><persName corresp="#KGWEIHE">Weihe</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#WEIHERUSKINMANUSCRIPTS">&#x201C;A Collection of Ruskin Manuscripts&#x201D;</title></ref>, 47). 
                            These two lots are not included in the documentation of Goodspeed's November 1930 transfer of Sotheby's sale items to Yale, 
                            nor are the items that Goodspeed did definitely sell to Yale in 1930 mentioned in the Gazette article. 
                            It is possible that, within the "considerable portion of the Brantwood collection", the Gazette writer meant also to comprise 
                            the items acquired from Goodspeed, but that he focused on lots 110 and 112 because they stood out from the rest, set apart not only by their contents relating to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s youth, 
                            but also by their striking blue&#x2010;morocco casings. Still, the focus on "this noteworthy group" of juvenilia and letters--represented 
                            in the Gazette as "an impressive addition to the Library's collection of Ruskiniana", which was already grounded 
                            in "the completeness of its first editions and rarity of its items" donated in 1929 as the R. B. Adam Collection--begs 
                            the question of who purchased these two lots and how they come to Yale

                        <p>According to the annotated sale catalogue at the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke</orgName>, 
                            the successful bids for lots 110 and 112 were placed by <persName corresp="#ALLENH">&#x201C;Allen&#x201D;</persName> (lot 110, &#x00A3;520; lot 112, &#x00A3;260). 
                            This member of the George Allen family was probably <persName corresp="#ALLENH">Hugh Allen</persName>, whose role in the sale 
                            can be gathered from a letter by <persName corresp="#RBROWN">Ralph Brown</persName> of <orgName corresp="#BFSTEVENSBROWN">B. F. Stevens &#x0026; Brown</orgName> 
                            to <persName corresp="#JHW">J. H. Whitehouse</persName> on the occasion of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_severn_1931_note.php">Severn Sale of Ruskin Effects, <date when="1931">1931</date></ref>: 
                            &#x201C;we are having the benefit of the assistance of our friend Mr. <persName corresp="#ALLENH"> Hugh Allen</persName>, 
                            and his help has been invaluable&#x201D;, as compared with &#x201C;the lack of interest shown by the Severn family in all matters pertaining to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x201D; 
                            (quoted in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RUSKINBEMBRIDGEBRANTWOOD"><persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINBB"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin, Bembridge, and Brantwood</hi></title></ref>, 87). 
                            Beyond the initial purchase of lots 110 and 112 by Allen, however, the details of the manuscripts&#x02BC; journey 
                            from <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#NEWHAVEN">New Haven</placeName> are obscured by conflicting evidence.</p>
                        
                        <p>According to a 1942 article on the Yale Ruskin collection authored by <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Charles Beecher Hogan</persName>, lot 112 containing the twelve &#x201C;little notebooks&#x201D; of juvenilia were 
                            &#x201C;purchased by Mr. <persName corresp="#CG">Charles Goodspeed</persName>&#x201D; when they were auctioned &#x201C;en bloc at <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02BC;s&#x201D;, 
                            and &#x201C;in turn" these items were "purchased by <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>&#x201D;. It seems odd that Goodspeed 
                            would have commissioned two agents at the sale--Allen, as well as Stevens and Brown--unless, for some reason, Allen acted in concert 
                            with Stevens and Brown to obtain these two particular lots. Adding to the confusion, <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName> says that the volumes of letters (lot 110) &#x201C;were purchased by 
                            <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> at the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName> auction of <date when="1930-07-24">July 24, 1930</date>&#x201D;--a 
                            vague statement, suggesting either that <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> did not transact through <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> for lot 110, 
                            or that Goodspeed's mediation is to be taken for granted by the reader. The latter assumption should have been forestalled 
                            by a footnote specifying that "other items that came from Brantwood, through Sotheby and Goodspeed" have been "marked 
                            with an asterisk". Hogan does not attach an asterisk to "the magnificent assemblage of Ruskin's letters" at Yale, 
                            leading one to the conclusion that Yale acquired the letters, lot 110, directly through the agency of Hugh Allen, 
                            while lot 112 came roundabout to Yale, from Allen to Goodspeed to the university library

                            In the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#KEOGHREPORT_1930-31">"Report of the Librarian, July 1, 1930-June 30, 1931"</ref>, 
                            published 1 April 1932, the purchase of "a large mass of Ruskin material" 
                            is reported, listing "letters written by him to his father" (but not the juvenilia) along with the items that formed the Goodspeed purchase. 
                            Perhaps the obscurity surrounding these purchases must simply be put down their having been overshadowed by 
                            "the great event of the year--the greatest since the founding of the Library"--which is announced at start of this issue of the 
                            "Report of the Librarian" as "the transfer of the books and of the functions of the Library to the Sterling Memorial building (pp. 8, 3).</p>
                        
                        <p>At about the same time that Yale's new Sterling Library building was completed and opened in 1930-31, 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="tinker_c_b_note.php"><persName corresp="#CBT">Chauncey Brewster Tinker</persName> (1876-1963)</ref> 
                            took up his post as keeper of rare books for the libary in addition to his professorial appointment in the English Department. 
                            While his name does not appear in connection with Yale's boon from the 1930 Sotheby's sale, 
                            Tinker is likely to have taken a keen interest in the Ruskin materials, and perhaps advised about their acquisition, whether or not he had an active role. 
                            Sources differ whether Tinker was appointed keeper of rare books at Yale University Library in 1930 or 1931, 
                            but he had long been an advocate for building up the library's collection, and he was a legendary teacher 
                            of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literature--including Ruskin, whom he treated as a thinker, and not just a fine stylist. 
                            Tinker was also known for giving students access to manuscripts and rare books from his extensive personal collection, 
                            which included Ruskin; and he was aware of the extent and interest of Ruskin's bibliographical history. 
                            In 1929, the year prior to the Sotheby's sale, Tinker's close friend and fellow collector,

                            donated his meticulously curated Ruskin collection to Yale; and it is notable how felicitously lots 110 and 112, 
                            the letters and juvenilia, complement Adam's bequest, which includes the run of early poems published in annuals

                            Ruskin's intentions for his estate as stated in his will, implying that the Severn family may have acted in bad faith
