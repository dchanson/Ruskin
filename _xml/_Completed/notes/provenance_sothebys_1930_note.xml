                <p>On <date when="1930-07-24">24 July 1930</date>, <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby &#x0026; Co.</orgName> held an important sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s literary remains, 
                    described in the sale catalogue&#x02BC;s title as the

                        and of His Trustees . . . </hi></title></ref>. 
                    This sale was perhaps the single most consequential event for the provenance of the early manuscripts.</p>

                        <head type="subsection">Books from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s Library</head>
                        
                        <p>The first 109 lots of the sale contained items from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s library. 
                            More than half the lots (24&#x2013;83) were devoted to the <title type="archive" corresp="#GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">&#x201C;<persName corresp="#CKG">Kate Greenaway</persName> Collection from Brantwood&#x201D;</title>, 
                            while the remainder ranged from illuminated manuscripts and incunabula to modern first editions and presentation copies. 
                            <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> must have anticipated that the <title type="archive" corresp="#GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">Greenaway collection</title> would command interest, 
                            since the firm devoted four of the six plates in the illustrated catalogue to drawings from her books, 
                            as compared with only two plates showing <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts. 
                            The expectation was justified, as indicated by a copy of the sale catalogue at the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke Library</orgName> 
                            that was annotated by an observer. Almost every lot in the <title type="archive" corresp="#GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">Greenaway collection</title> found a buyer, 
                            with the highest price of &#x00A3;420 paid for a collection of autograph letters from <persName corresp="#CKG">Greenaway</persName> to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>.</p>
                        
                        <p>Among the books unrelated to <persName corresp="#CKG">Greeanway</persName>, a copy of <persName corresp="#WBP">William Blake</persName>&#x02BC;s illustrated edition of 
                            <persName corresp="#EY">Young</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#EYNIGHTTHOUGHTS"><hi rend="italic">Night Thoughts</hi></title>,

                            Otherwise, according to the annotator of the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke</orgName> copy of the 
                            <title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1930">sale catalogue</title>, the rare book and manuscript dealers <orgName corresp="#MAGGS">Maggs</orgName> and 
                            <orgName corresp="#MAGGS">Bernard Quaritch</orgName> acquired a few of the manuscript volumes and modern illustrated volumes, 
                            while other lots either were left unsold or their buyers unrecorded by the annotator. The <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke</orgName> copy of the catalogue 
                            fails to note the sale, for example, of at least two items of incunabula as well as two lots of <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName> novels that, 
                            according to <persName corresp="#JSD">James S. Dearden</persName>, were purchased by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="whitehouse_j_h_note.php"><persName corresp="#JHW">J. H. Whitehouse</persName></ref>

                            [lots 84, 89]). Of the five available lots of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> novels, 96&#x2013;100, apparently only lots 96 and 100 were purchased by <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName>, 
                            which he singled out perhaps because the <title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1930">catalogue</title> mentions these as containing annotations by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>.</p>

                                                although admittedly this information is rather deeply buried in the bibliography volume 
                                                (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 38:206). 
                                                The catalogue describes the notebooks as a group: &#x201C;74&#x2013;84&#x2013;84 pp. containing geological, historical and grammatical notes, 
                                                half roan, 6 &#x00D7; 4 in.&#x201D; This summary of the contents credibly, if only roughly, corresponds to the Latin grammar, mineralogy, travel itineraries, and sermon drafts in fact 
                                                contained in these manuscripts. The material &#x201C;half roan&#x201D; is incorrect, however&#x2014;the notebooks being full roan, like the 
                                                <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title></ref> in I.1&#x2013;5, above&#x2014;and the catalogue&#x02BC;s page count of the notebooks 
                                                only very roughly approximates the 44 leaves, 42 leaves, and 43 leaves respectively found in them, as follows. The catalogue may afford a clue, however, that a 
                                                leaf now missing from the third of these notebooks was still attached at the time of the sale, since that possibility would account for the catalogue&#x02BC;s identical

                            <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> took the same approach to the <date when="1930">1930</date> <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02bc;s</orgName> sale, assisted by <orgName corresp="#BFSTEVENSBROWN">B. F. Stevens &#x0026; Brown</orgName> as his agent. 
                            Whereas <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName>&#x02bc;s manuscript acquisitions were canonical by the standards of the time&#x2014;the diaries,

                            targeted very early and very late works: for example, manuscripts of <title type="story" corresp="#JRTHEKINGOFTHEGOLDENRIVER"><hi rend="italic">King of the Golden River</hi></title> (lot 114, &#x00A3;155),

                        <p>Curiously, in what appears to be the earliest published report describing acquisitions by <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> 
                            from the <date when="1930-07">July 1930</date> <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s sale, none of these items is mentioned. 
                            Instead, a <date when="1931-01">January 1931</date> report in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#YALEGAZETTE"><hi rend="italic">Yale University Library Gazette</hi></title> 
                            lengthily describes manuscripts that were not listed in <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s <date when="1930-11">November 1930</date> sale&#x2014;namely, 
                            lots 110 and 112, consisting of the six bound volumes of Ruskin family letters and the six slipcases containing juvenilia. 
                            In the <title type="periodical" corresp="#YALEGAZETTE"><hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi></title>, these items are celebrated as forming 
                            &#x201C;a considerable portion of the <placeName corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName> collection of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts&#x201D; 
                            which is &#x201c;now preserved for all time against sale and spoliation&#x201d; at <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#COLLECTIONRUSKINMANUSCRIPTS"><persName corresp="#KGWEIHE">Weihe</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#WEIHERUSKINMANUSCRIPTS">&#x201C;A Collection of Ruskin Manuscripts&#x201D;</title></ref>, 47). 
                            It is possible that the phrase &#x201c;considerable portion of the <placeName corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName> collection&#x201d; is meant also to comprise 
                            the items acquired from <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, and that the writer chose to focus on lots 110 and 112. 
                            Not only would these acquisitions have stood out from the rest by virtue of their striking blue&#x2010;morocco casings; 
                            their contents were also notable for their biographical interest, particularly pertaining to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s youth&#x2014;and in that respect, the writer goes on, &#x201c;this noteworthy group&#x201d; of juvenilia and letters 
                            represented &#x201c;an impressive addition to the Library&#x02bc;s collection of Ruskiniana&#x201d;, which had been recently augmented 
                            by &#x201c;the completeness of its first editions and rarity of its items&#x201d; donated in <date when="1929">1929</date> as the <title type="archive" corresp="#RBARUSKINCOLLECTION"><persName corresp="#RBA">R. B. Adam</persName> Collection</title>

                            would have seemed complemented not only by the juvenilia but also by the manuscripts of late works acquired from <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>. 
                            The report seems to testify to a special interest in the early manuscripts, at least among American collectors. It also begs the question of just how these manuscripts 
                            made their way to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> from the <date when="1930-07">1930</date> <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s auction.</p>

                            the successful bids for lots 110 and 112 were placed by <persName corresp="#ALLENH">&#x201C;Allen&#x201D;</persName> (lot 110, &#x00A3;520; lot 112, &#x00A3;260). 
                            That this was a member of the <persName corresp="#GA">George Allen</persName> family, probably <persName corresp="#ALLENH">Hugh Allen</persName>, 
                            can be gathered from a letter by <persName corresp="#RBROWN">Ralph Brown</persName> of <orgName corresp="#BFSTEVENSBROWN">B. F. Stevens &#x0026; Brown</orgName> 
                            to <persName corresp="#JHW">J. H. Whitehouse</persName> on the occasion of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_severn_1931_note.php">Severn Sale of Ruskin Effects, <date when="1931">1931</date></ref>:

                            Beyond the initial purchase of lots 110 and 112 by <persName corresp="#ALLENH">Allen</persName>, however, the details of the manuscripts&#x02BC; journey

                            &#x201C;purchased by Mr. <persName corresp="#CG">Charles Goodspeed</persName>&#x201D; when they were auctioned &#x201C;en bloc at <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02BC;s&#x201D;, 
                            and &#x201C;in turn&#x201d; these items were &#x201c;purchased by <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>&#x201D;. If true, it seems odd that <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> 
                            would have commissioned two agents at the sale&#x2014;<persName corresp="#ALLENH">Allen</persName>, as well as <orgName corresp="#BFSTEVENSBROWN">B. F.

                            with <orgName corresp="#BFSTEVENSBROWN">B. F. Stevens &#x0026; Brown</orgName> to obtain these two particular lots. Adding to the confusion, <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName> says that the volumes of letters (lot 110) &#x201C;were purchased by 
                            <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> at the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName> auction of <date when="1930-07-24">July 24, 1930</date>&#x201D;&#x2014;a 
                            vague statement, suggesting either that <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> did not transact through <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> for lot 110, 
                            or that <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s mediation is to be taken for granted by the reader. The latter assumption should have been clarified 
                            by a footnote specifying that &#x201c;other items that came from <placeName corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName>, through <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName> and <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x201d; have been &#x201c;marked 
                            with an asterisk&#x201d;. <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName> does not attach an asterisk to &#x201c;the magnificent assemblage of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s letters&#x201d; at <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>, 
                            leading one to the conclusion that <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> acquired the letters, lot 110, directly through the agency of <persName corresp="#ALLENH">Hugh Allen</persName>, 
                            while lot 112 came roundabout to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>, from <persName corresp="#ALLENH">Allen</persName> to <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> to the university library

                            &#x201c;bought from <orgName corresp="#GOODSPEEDSBOOKSHOP">Goodspeed&#x02BC;s Book Shop</orgName> by <persName corresp="#CBT">Chauncey B. Tinker</persName>, <date when="1930">1930</date>&#x201d;. 
                            An exception is lot 117, four notebooks containing manuscript of <title type="book" corresp="#JRPROSERPINA"><hi rend="italic">Proserpina</hi></title>,

                            although this lot is otherwise documented as packaged with the &#x0024;3,000 purchase from <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>. 
                            Unsurprisingly, then, <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName> was intimately involved in the <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> transaction,

                            for himself for a time, or simply donated funds for that portion of the purchase&#x2014;and the separate provenance of lots 110 and 112 remains a mystery.</p>
                        
                        <p><persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName> had long been an advocate for building up the <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Library</orgName>&#x02bc;s collection, especially its rare book collection, 
                            and he was a legendary teacher of eighteenth&#x2010; and nineteenth&#x2010;century literature&#x2014;including <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, 
                            whom he treated seriously as a thinker, and not just as a prose stylist. <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName> was also known for giving students access to manuscripts and rare books from his extensive personal collection, 
                            which included <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>; and he was aware of the extent and interest of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s bibliographical history. 
                            In <date when="1929">1929</date>, the year prior to the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s sale, <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName>&#x02bc;s close friend and fellow collector,

                            was moving to the newly completed <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling Memorial Building</placeName>, an imposing Gothic Revival structure.
