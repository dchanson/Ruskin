                <p>Scottish poet and fiction writer. <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> was familiarly known as the <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JH">&#x201C;Ettrick Shepherd&#x201D;</persName>, owing to his youth spent as a shepherd in <geogName corresp="#ETTRICKFOREST">Ettrick Forest</geogName>. 
                    Later, when a successful writer, he returned to the area, dividing his time between <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName> literary life and a farm, <placeName corresp="#ALTRIVE">Altrive</placeName>,

                    The farm lay near to <placeName corresp="#ABBOTSFORD">Abbotsford</placeName>, the residence of <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s friend, the novelist <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>, in

                <p><persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> met the Ruskin family personally sometime between <date notBefore="1832-01" notAfter="1832-03">January and March 1832</date>, 
                    when he undertook his first visit to <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> 
                    (specifically, probably between <date notBefore="1832-01-14" notAfter="1832-02-19">14 January and 19 February</date>, 
                    when <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> was not away from home, traveling to customers [see

                    and even more likely between <date notBefore="1832-01-14" notAfter="1832-02-08">14 January and 8 February</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s birthday, as explained below).
                    In a later letter thanking <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> for his hospitality, <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> 
                    mentions meeting <persName corresp="#MR">Mrs. Ruskin</persName> and <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>, 
                    but not <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cousin, <persName corresp="#MBR">Mary Richardson</persName>. 
                    <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s purpose in coming to <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> 
                    was to arrange for a collected edition of his prose fiction, the <title type="book" corresp="#ALTRIVETALES"><hi rend="italic">Altrive Tales</hi></title>.
                    His mission was tied to a significant phenomenon in British book publishing of the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> and <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>, 
                    the production of accessibly priced, but well produced, uniform editions of collected works of modern British writers.
                </p> 
                <p><persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> had long sought to publish a collected edition of his tales, which would complement his two collected editions of poetry, 
                    but he was now emboldened by the success of a new plan pursued by his friend, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="scott_walter_note.php"><persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName> (<date notBefore="1771" notAfter="1832">1771&#x2013;1832</date>)</ref>, 
                    and by <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s publisher, <orgName corresp="#CADELLROBERT">Robert Cadell</orgName>. 
                    Hoping to tap into a popular market, <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> and <orgName corresp="#CADELLROBERT">Cadell</orgName> conceived the <hi rend="italic">magnum opus</hi> edition of the Waverley novels, 
                    which offered consumers monthly volumes of accessibly priced, yet handsomely produced, uniform volumes of the novels, each freshened with a new preface by the author, 
                    and each embellished with a few engraved illustrations.
                </p>
                <p>At the very modest price of five or six shillings per volume, the success of the scheme depended on high&#x2010;volume sales to a broad market. 
                    <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s venture, which began in <date when="1829">1829</date>, proved so successful that other publishers soon repeated the experiment by profitably 
                    reprinting the works of other popular authors. The marketing plan was supported by innovations in printing, especially mass&#x2010;producible illustration using steel engraving, 
                    which supported a boom trade in <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</ref> aimed at the middle class. 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself would debut in <date when="1834">1834</date> as a writer for this trade. 
                </p>
                <p><persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> publisher, <orgName corresp="#COCHRANE">James Cochrane</orgName>, had produced such an edition, collecting <date notBefore="1701" notAfter="1800">eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> British novelists, 
                    and <orgName corresp="#COCHRANE">Cochrane</orgName> promised <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> the services of that edition&#x02BC;s well&#x2010;known illustrator, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="cruikshank_george_note.php"><persName corresp="#GC">George Cruikshank</persName> (<date notBefore="1792" notAfter="1878">1792&#x2013;1878</date>)</ref>. 
                    Regrettably, the venture came to grief because <orgName corresp="#COCHRANE">Cochrane</orgName> went bankrupt. 
                    <orgName corresp="#COCHRANE">Cochrane</orgName> ultimately managed to produce one volume of the projected edition of <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s tales, 
                    a volume that contained not only three of the tales but also (and a precursor to what became a characteristic feature in collected editions of modern writers) an 
                    autobiographical &#x201C;Memoir&#x201D; <!--DCH: Title?--> by the author; a portrait engraving of <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>, which served as the volume&#x02BC;s frontispiece 
                    (created by <persName corresp="#CFENGRAVER">Charles Fox</persName> [<date notBefore="1794" notAfter="1849">1794&#x2013;1849</date>], an artist who 
                    who had contributed illustrations to <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s <hi rend="italic">magnum opus</hi> edition); and a cut by <persName corresp="#GC">Cruikshank</persName> illustrating one of the tales 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUGHESHOGGLIFE"><persName corresp="#GH">Hughes</persName>, <title type="biography" corresp="#HUGHESHOGGLIFE" rend="italic">James Hogg</title></ref>, 222&#x2010;23, 265&#x2010;66, 281, 287;

                </p>
                <p>
                    Later, when <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> returned to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> following <orgName corresp="#COCHRANE">Cochrane</orgName>&#x02BC;s failure, 
                    the author negotiated with a <placeName corresp="#GLASGOW">Glasgow</placeName> publisher, <orgName corresp="#BLACKIESON">Blackie &#x0026; Son</orgName>, who arranged for a reprint series of the fiction, 
                    by employing the <placeName corresp="#GLASGOW">Glasgow</placeName> system of &#x201C;numbers&#x201D; publishing. In this scheme, books were published in segments, 
                    issued monthly in paper covers, so that the consumer of modest means could compile complete volumes over time with small outlays 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUGHESINTROHOGGLETTERSVOL3">Hughes, introduction to Hogg, <title type="essay" corresp="#HUGHESINTROHOGGLETTERSVOL3"><hi rend="italic">Letters, <date notBefore="1832" notAfter="1835">1832&#x2013;1835</date></hi></title></ref>, xxxix&#x2013;xl). 
                    In <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s case, the resulting six volumes of fiction published by <orgName corresp="#BLACKIESON">Blackie &#x0026; Son</orgName> proved a far cry from the uniform edition of the 
                    <title type="book" corresp="#HOGGALTRIVETALES"><hi rend="italic">Altrive Tales</hi></title>, modeled on <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s <hi rend="italic">magnum opus</hi> edition.
                </p> 
                <p>These ambitions and disappointments concerning publishing arrangements are relevant to the Ruskins&#x02BC; acquaintance with <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>, 
                    because the writer became embroiled in these difficulties in the years leading up to 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own introduction to the professional <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> literary world as 
                    &#x201C;<persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">J.R.</persName>&#x201D; 
                    In <date when="1829">1829</date> and <date when="1830">1830</date>, two poems by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> based on his <ref type="apparatus" target="description_of_skiddaw_and_lake_derwent_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINSKIDDAWANDDERWENT">&#x201C;Description of Skiddaw and Lake Derwent&#x201D;</title></ref> <!--DCH: Title?--> 
                    had already appeared in the <title type="magazine" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES" rend="italic">Spiritual Times</title>; however, this magazine, which was published by the Ruskins&#x02BC; clergyman and <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s tutor, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="andrews_edward_note.php"><persName corresp="#EA">Edward Andrews</persName> (<date notBefore="1787" notAfter="1841">1787&#x2013;1841</date>)</ref>, 
                    amounted almost to a family affair. The boy&#x02BC;s continuing facile and prolific poetry composition gave promise of a more ambitious and prominent staging of his talents, 
                    and doubtless <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> was keenly observant to learn how publishers operated.
                </p>
                <p>As <persName corresp="#GH">Gillian Hughes</persName> remarks, <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s disappointed expectations reflect the transition between publishing in the age of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> and 
                    the more volatile and confusing print culture in the age of <persName corresp="#CJHD">Dickens</persName>. 
                    <orgName corresp="#COCHRANE">Cochrane</orgName>&#x02BC;s collapse, which occurred only <date when="1832">six years after the bank failures of <date when="1826">1826</date></date> 
                    had already ruined many publishers, represented the riskier possibilities 
                    in publishing that were opening up alongside apparently solid houses like <orgName corresp="#MURRAY">John Murray</orgName> and <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>. 
                    <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> presents an exemplary figure for authorship during this transitional period. 
                    He was willing to experiment with new ways to reach his public; and despite his relative isolation on his <placeName corresp="#ALTRIVE">Altrive</placeName> farm, 
                    he had become a literary celebrity by embracing new modes of publication. At the same time, <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> expressed doubts about the effects of cheap publication 
                    on &#x201C;legitimate literature.&#x201D; His attitudes were colored not only by his personal professional triumphs and disappointments 
                    in his ongoing struggle to support his family&#x2010;high fame coupled with great risk, as mirrored in the career of his more august friend, <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>&#x2013;but also 
                    by his hardening Toryism, which resulted from adverse personal experiences during the country&#x02BC;s disturbances over the <date when="1832">1832</date> Reform Bill 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUGHESINTROHOGGLETTERSVOL3"><persName corresp="#GH">Hughes</persName>, introduction to <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HUGHESINTROHOGGLETTERSVOL3"><hi rend="italic">Letters, <date notBefore="1832" notAfter="1835">1832&#x2013;1835</date></hi></title></ref>, xli, xxxviii&#x2013;xxxix).
                </p>
                <p>Meanwhile, in <date notBefore="1832-01" notAfter="1832-03">the first quarter of 1832</date>, <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> visit 
                    was pleasurable and flattering, as the <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JH">Ettrick Shepherd</persName> was widely feted as a literary celebrity&#x2014;especially, 
                    though not exclusively, among Scottish residents. 
                    <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> was known for his poetry and fiction, but he was perhaps most famous for his association with a character, the &#x201C;<persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JH">Shepherd</persName>,&#x201D; 
                    in the <title type="series" corresp="#NOCTESAMBROSIANAE" rend="italic">Noctes Ambrosianae</title> series in the <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName> periodical, 
                    <title type="magazine" corresp="#BLACKWOODMAGAZINE"><hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x02BC;s Magazine</hi></title>. In his first visit to the metropolis, <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> was ready to take control over his own public persona. 
                    He had already unsettled the complacency of <title type="periodical" corresp="#BLACKWOODMAGAZINE"><hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x02BC;s</hi></title> by pursuing 
                    the offer by a <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> publisher, <orgName corresp="#COCHRANE">Cochrane</orgName>, 
                    to take on the edition of the <title type="book" corresp="#HOGGALTRIVETALES"><hi rend="italic">Altrive Tales</hi></title>. Now he sent contributions to a new <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> periodical, <title type="magazine" corresp="#FRASERMAGAZINE" rend="italic">Fraser&#x02BC;s Magazine</title>, 
                    which had set out in <date when="1830">1830</date> to rival specifically <title type="periodical" corresp="#BLACKWOODMAGAZINE"><hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x02BC;s Magazine</hi></title>. 
                    The connection with <title type="magazine" corresp="#FRASERMAGAZINE"><hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x02BC;s</hi></title> was especially gratifying for <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> 
                    in that the metropolitan periodical did not balk at his irreverence and bawdiness&#x2014;always 
                    an impediment in Calvinist <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">North Britain</placeName> to granting <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> his due respect as a sophisticated writer 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUGHESHOGGLIFE"><persName corresp="#GH">Hughes</persName>, <title type="biography" corresp="#HUGHESHOGGLIFE"><hi rend="italic">James Hogg</hi></title></ref>, 233&#x2013;34).
                </p>
                <p>During <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s visit to <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, 
                    the circle of Scottish literati who were established in the city had already grown alarmed over the probable state of 
                    <orgName corresp="#COCHRANE">Cochrane</orgName>&#x02BC;s solvency, so <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s friends attempted to raise funds for the writer. 
                    <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> refused charity, but he consented to a scheme for publication by subscription of a new deluxe edition of 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#THEQUEENSWAKE"><hi rend="italic">The Queen&#x02BC;s Wake</hi></title> (<date notBefore="1813" notAfter="1819">1813&#x2013;19</date>), the poem that had first established his reputation. 
                    To this effort, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> subscribed generously 
                    with a donation of &#x00A3;20, asking <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> in a letter of <date when="1832-02-08">8 February 1832</date> for the honor of being the first subscriber 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUGHESHOGGLIFE"><persName corresp="#GH">Hughes</persName>, <title type="biography" corresp="#HUGHESHOGGLIFE"><hi rend="italic">James Hogg</hi></title></ref>, 251&#x2013;52, 266;

                    It was surely no accident that the date of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s donation was his son&#x02BC;s <date when="1832-02-08">thirteenth birthday</date>. 
                    Symbolically, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> was investing his son in modern Caledonian poetry. Moreover, the projected form of the book, a 
                    deluxe edition of an established modern classic, reflected the success of another illustrated edition of modern poetry, 
                    which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> is believed to have received on his <date when="1832-02-08">thirteenth birthday</date>&#x2012;the <date when="1830">1830</date> edition of 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY" rend="italic">Italy</title> by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="rogers_samuel_note.php"><persName corresp="#SR">Samuel Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s (<date when="1763">1763</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855">1855</date></ref>), 
                    which was illustrated by <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>, <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>, and others. 
                    The Ruskins were thus taking a direct part in a distinctly contemporary mode of book production aimed at politely learned middle&#x2010;class consumers like themselves. 
                    Ultimately, the  <title type="collected_poems" corresp="#THEQUEENSWAKE" rend="italic">Queen&#x02BC;s Wake</title> venture presented a stark contrast with the ongoing best&#x2010;seller status of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY" rend="italic">Italy</title> and 
                    his <date when="1834">1834</date> collected <title type="book" corresp="#ROGERSPOEMS1834"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title>, also illustrated by <persName corresp="#TSP">Turner</persName>.
                </p>
                <p>Confessing in a reply to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> that he felt &#x201C;queer&#x201D; accepting the donation but admitting to his pressing financial need, 
                    <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> was emboldened by the gift to write to <persName corresp="#JGL">John Gibson Lockhart</persName> (<date notBefore="1794" notAfter="1854">1794&#x2013;1854</date>), the influential editor and the son&#x2010;in&#x2010;law of <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>, 
                    nudging him with ideas for the edition. (The impetus for the deluxe <title type="poem" corresp="#THEQUEENSWAKE"><hi rend="italic">Queen&#x02BC;s Wake</hi></title> edition was formally urged by the prestigious 
                    <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> firm headed by the Scotsman, <persName corresp="#JM">John Murray</persName>, 
                    for whom <persName corresp="#JGL">Lockhart</persName> worked as the editor of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#QUARTERLYREVIEW"><hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi></title>.) 
                    Cannily, <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> insinuated terms for the book, which, he wrote, &#x201C;should be a work something like The Keepsake<!-- not italicized in original --> 
                    with fewer ornaments yet so as to make it a drawing&#x2010;room book&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HOGGWORKSLETTERSVOL3"><persName corresp="#GH">Hughes</persName>, ed., <title type="collected_letters" corresp="#HOGGWORKSLETTERSVOL3"><hi rend="italic">The Collected Letters: Volume 3, 1832&#x2010;1835</hi></title></ref>, 32, 33). 
                    <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s description shows that he wanted to take advantage of the fashion 
                    for <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.xml">literary annuals</ref>, 
                    publications meant to appeal to middle&#x2010;class consumers as presenting allegedly quality samplings of the nation&#x02BC;s art and literature, 
                    while also constituting showy but accessibly priced luxury items for the &#x201C;drawing&#x2010;room&#x201D;. 
                    <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s citing the <title type="annual" corresp="#KEEPSAKE"><hi rend="italic">Keepsake</hi></title> as an example was strategic, since this annual was among the costliest and most elegant of the many crowding the market 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED"><persName corresp="#BH">Hunnisett</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED"><hi rend="italic">Steel&#x2010;Engraved Book Illustration in England</hi></title></ref>,

                    As a potential illustrator for the deluxe edition, <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> dropped the name of the popular artist, <persName corresp="#JMARTIST">John Martin</persName> (<date when="1789" notAfter="1854">1789&#x2010;1854</date>), 
                    whom <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> met personally during his <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> visit, and whose work he had encountered and admired in the annuals as well as in the mezzotints by which <persName corresp="#JMARTIST">Martin</persName>&#x02BC;s apocalyptic 
                    fantasies were widely disseminated. <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> also mentioned &#x201C;some others who would do [an illustration] for me <hi rend="italic">con amore</hi>

                    <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> appreciated the visual arts, and througout his <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> visit, 
                    he sought opportunities to view exhibitions and converse with artists

                </p>
                <p>Additional subscription funds were collected and eventually sent to <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>, and <persName corresp="#JMARTIST">Martin</persName> 
                    did create and exhibit a watercolor drawing based on the tale of <title type="poem" corresp="#HOGGKILMENY"><hi rend="italic">Kilmeny</hi></title>, 
                    which forms part of the bards&#x02BC; competition in <title type="poem" corresp="#THEQUEENSWAKE"><hi rend="italic">The Queen&#x02BC;s Wake</hi></title>; however, 
                    the planned book ultimately went the way of <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s other disappointments resulting from his <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> venture, 
                    and the deluxe edition was never published

                    Months later in <date when="1832">1832</date>, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> would add his name to another list for publication by subscription&#x2013;this one

                    This publication did come to fruition, and <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> was doubtless flattered to be listed among subscribers who included members of the aristocracy, 
                    well&#x2010;known artists, and other successful professional men. Earlier in the year, he must have been equally proud to lead the way 
                    among prosperous Scottish <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> merchants in supporting <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02Bc;s book, an elegant expression of modern Caledonian poetry. 
                    Nonetheless, while <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s book proved auspicious in helping <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to envision his own place in the British print production of art and poetry in the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date> 
                    (see <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php">Account of a Tour on the Continent</ref>), 
                    the example of <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s ill&#x2010;fated <title type="poem" corresp="#THEQUEENSWAKE"><hi rend="italic">Queen&#x02BC;s Wake</hi></title> subscription edition must have worked in part as a cautionary tale. 
                    As a representative publishing project of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>, the fading away of the deluxe <title type="poem" corresp="#THEQUEENSWAKE"><hi rend="italic">Queen&#x02BC;s Wake</hi></title> 
                    along with the compromising of the <title type="book" corresp="#ALTRIVETALES"><hi rend="italic">Altrive Tales</hi></title> edition poses a inverse complement to <persName corresp="#TBM">Thomas Macaulay</persName>&#x02BC;s

                    which presents an image of precocious youthful poetry in naturalized terms. <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> composed the poem at <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s behest

                    In commissioning verse for this picture, <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> asked that <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> 
                    connect the image with &#x201C;the glorious romance of your own boyhood when the spirit of poetry &#x0026; romance 
                    first began to pour over you the visions of fairyland&#x201D;. <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> invented a speaker who identifies with the minstrel boy nostalgically, 
                    but distances himself with some disillusionment.

                <p>The affection for youth that <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> expressed in these poems is reflected in his letters to his own children; and during his <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> visit, he cultivated attachments

                <p>One year lapsed before <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> followed up on this remembrance with a letter of <date when="1834-01-22">22 January 1834</date>,

                    him &#x201C;with a sight of part&#x201D; of the <date when="1833-01">January 1833</date> letter commending his son, but that meanwhile 
                    &#x201C;sundry hints from our wife, and niece, and son&#x201D; had been urging reply, since &#x201C;all indulge in periodical remembrances of the delight your only too short visit offered them&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GARDENMEMORIALS"><persName corresp="#MGHGARDEN">Garden</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#GARDENMEMORIALS"><hi rend="italic">Memorials of James Hogg</hi></title></ref>, 273&#x2010;74). 
                    What <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> suggests only indirectly is that he was now prompted to confide in <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> 
                    concerning <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;precocity of talent&#x201D;, which <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> held in high regard despite his reservations about precocity as such.
                </p>
                <p>In his letter, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> says that he has ventured to write because <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> 
                    is a man &#x201C;of talent and of heart&#x201D;, whereas &#x201C;the world at large&#x201D;, 
                    lacks &#x201C;comprehen[sion] . . . patience . . . feeling . . . delicacy,&#x201D; and <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> dares not entrust others with his 
                    &#x201C;weaknesses, because&#x201D; he is &#x201C;not yet willing to be laughed out of them&#x201D;. 
                    Namely, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> declares, &#x201C;the youth you were kind enough to notice,&#x201D; his son <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>, &#x201C;gives promise of very considerable talent.  
                    His faculty of composition is unbounded&#x201D;. The composition that has finally persuaded <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> 
                    to bring <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s talent to <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s attention is

                    production of &#x201C;thosands of lines.&#x201D; <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> included as a sample <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s latest &#x201C;80 or 100 lines&#x201D; (unidentified), 
                    which the boy &#x201C;produced in one hour, while he waited for me in the city&#x201D;

                <p>Perhaps abashed by <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s expression of distaste for precocity, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> 
                    hastens to assure <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> that he and <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> are not &#x201C;fostering a poetical plant or genius&#x201D; in order to be able &#x201C;to say <hi rend="italic">we keep a poet</hi>. 
                    It is impossible for any parents to make less of a gift than we do of this, firstly, from its small intrinsic value, as yet unsuspected in him; 
                    and next, because we dread the sacrifice of our offspring by making him a victim to the pangs of despised verse, a sacrifice to a thankless world, 
                    who read, admire, and trample on the greatest and the best&#x201D;

                    Here <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> appears to evoke the mythology surrounding

                    While suggestive more of rhetorical flourish than of credible anxiety, the allusion links <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName> as an emerging poet to <persName corresp="#JH">James Hogg</persName> as an established poet 
                    &#x201C;of talent and of heart,&#x201D; who has nonetheless reaped misfortune and abuse along with his fame. 
                    At the end of his letter, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> commiserates with the poet for having to retreat from the glare of <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> with his health compromised, 
                    his life&#x02BC;s work having fallen victim to an insecure publishing scheme. &#x201C;I should like to see your works coming forward in better hands,&#x201D; <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> concludes,

                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="rogers_samuel_note.php"><persName corresp="#SR">Samuel Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s (<date notBefore="1763" notAfter="1855">1763&#x2013;1855</date></ref>), 
                    who by comparison with <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> presented an almost opposite example of urbanity and success in the new illustrated literary publishing of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>, 
                    but who must also have seemed forbidding as a wealthy and influential &#x201C;man of taste&#x201D; in his London &#x201C;palace of art&#x201D;. 
                    In <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s appeal to <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> as a writer &#x201C;of talent and of heart&#x201D;, the father may have sought comfort not only from &#x201C;the world at large&#x201D;, 
                    which lacks &#x201C;comprehen[sion] . . . patience . . . feeling . . . delicacy&#x201D;, but specifically from the notoriously acid wit of the batchelor poet/banker 
                    of 22 <placeName corresp="#STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</placeName>.
                </p>
                <p>In a striking contrast with <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>, who received <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> for a stately visit of a few hours to his temple of taste, 
                    with its view of the fashionable metropolitan <placeName corresp="#GREENPARK">Green Park</placeName>, 
                    <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> invited the boy for an extended stay at his <placeName corresp="#ALTRIVE">Altrive</placeName> farm in <geogName corresp="#YARROWVALLEY">Yarrow</geogName>. The invitation was not unique, 
                    <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> having made such an offer also to the young daughter of his publisher, <persName corresp="#JCP">James Cochrane</persName>. 
                    <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> loved children and wielded great charm over them, and he appears to have thought of such visits as invigorating holidays for country&#x2010;starved city children 
                    in the company of his own &#x201C;noisy romping healthy brats but good learners&#x201D;

                    On <date when="1834-02-13">13 February 1834</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> wrote to decline <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s invitation, explaining that he could not &#x201C;make up [his] mind to leave [his] parents even for a short time&#x201D; 
                    until he went to university, and that his parents were &#x201C;equally tenacious&#x201D; of him. Writing of what might have been, however, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> summons an idyllic myth 
                    that frames the nurturing of the emergent writer in a georgic or pastoral setting, like the landscape surrounding <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="HOGGMINSTRELBOY">&#x201C;The Minstrel Boy&#x201D;.</title> 
                    Such mythology probably underwrote <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s motives in appealing 
                    to the <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JH">Ettrick Shepherd</persName> as a man of &#x201C;heart&#x201D; as well as talent.
