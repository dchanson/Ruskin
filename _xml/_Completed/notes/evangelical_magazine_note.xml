                <p>In a letter of <date when="1823-03-03">3 March 1823</date> to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>,

                    That spirit of pan&#x2010;evangelical catholicity of opinion and mission was reaffirmed at the start of the new series of the magazine in <date when="1823">1823</date>, 
                    but the position was being tested. A <title type="essay" corresp="#RETROSPECTEVANGELICALMAG">&#x201C;Retrospect&#x201D;</title> published in the first issue of the new series admitted to the emergence of rival denominational publications 
                    on both the <orgName corresp="#EVANGELICALANGLICANISM">Anglican Evangelical</orgName> and <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregational</orgName> sides. In fact, the editorship of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> itself 
                    became dominated by <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalists</orgName>, just as that sect prevailed within the organization that the magazine most prominently represented,

                <p>So much of each issue was given over to the section entitled <hi rend="italic">The Missionary Chronicle</hi> containing news and formal reports of <orgName corresp="#LMS">LMS</orgName> activity 
                    that the Ruskins&#x02BC; (or at least <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s) regular reading of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> 
                    implies a strong interest in missionary work. <!-- NEW MARKUP -->Indeed, the enthusiasm surrounding foreign missions accounts for a significant part of what tied the Ruskins to Congregationalism at this time, 
                    as documented by Ruskin's <!-- TITLE AND LINK TO APPARATUS -->"a theme", which is a transcript or summary of a meeting for soliciting missionary support, 
                    as well as by the entire family's eager reading of the journals and poetry of the Reverend Reginald Heber, Bishop of Calcutta. (Another part of their attraction 
                    to Congregationalism can be attributed to the preaching and evangelical energy of the <!-- NAME AND NOTE LINK -->Reverend Dr. Edward Andrews.)</p>
                
                <p>The Ruskins were not uncharacteristic in being bound to Congregationalism by the excitement surrounding foreign missions. 
                    ??? Thorne argues that this commitment was a key to coalescing a middle-class identity within Congregationalism. 
                    In the late eighteenth century, Thorne explains, "missions were a distinctively middle-class alternative to gentry modes of authority, 
                    a means of controlling the lower orders at home as well as abroad that was in direct opposition to traditional or gentry forms of rule”. 
                    "This is not to say", she goes on, "that the missionary language of opposition was antiauthoritarian, much less antinational" 
                    (Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture, 39, 43). 
                    The latter caveat applies especially to the Ruskins, who were not radical Dissenters, nor were the 1820s the revolutionary 1780s and '90s. 
                    It is perhaps telling that, in the second half of the 1820s, the Congregational chapel in Camberwell was led by 
                    the <persName corresp="#WO">Reverend William Orme</persName> (<date notBefore="1787" notAfter="1830">1787&#x2013;1830</date>), 
                    who, years earlier, had parted ways with his first mentor, Richard Haldane (0000&#x2013;00), who was both 
                    "one of Scotland's leading advocates of foreign missionary expansion" and a fervent supporter of the French Revolution. 
                    For the Ruskins, even Orme's chapel, if not Orme himself, may have borne too much the air of the "Protestant Dissenting Meeting House", as it was then called, 
                    as compared with "Dr. Andrews's Chapel" as named in the Evangelical Magazine 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WORMEDNB"><persName corresp="#AGORDON">Gordon</persName> and <persName corresp="#APB">Pimlott</persName>, <title type="dictionary_entry" corresp="#WORMEDNB">&#x201C;Orme, William [<date notBefore="1787" notAfter="1830">1787&#x2013;1830</date>]&#x201D;</title></ref>; 
                    Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture, 44 [on Haldane], 58-59 [on the increased working-class presence in Congregationalism in the wake of the Evangelical Revival; 
                    and see <!-- link to Discussion in apparatus to "theme" -->"the theme": Discussion).</p>
                    
                    <p>Middle-class Congregationalism was organized around fund-raising for foreign missions, 
                        following the catastrophe of the initially fervent but ill-conceived Congregational missions to the South Seas. 
                        Funded by a few wealthy patrons, and relying for success on the will of God, the ill-equipped and uninformed missions fell apart; 
                        consequently, the LMS reorganized fundraising on a broader basis, soliciting contributions both modest and substantial, metropolitan and provincial 
                        (Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture, 59-62).
                        This operation was reported in detail in the "Missionary Chronicle", which formed a lengthy portion of each issue of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> 
                        by the time Margaret Ruskin became a subscriber. The published tables of contributions to the <orgName corresp="#LMS">LMS</orgName>, 
                        were calculated, as <persName corresp="#SSIVASUNDARAM">Sujit Sivasundaram</persName> argues, to inspire readers with a collective experience of evangelical zeal. 
                        The lists were observantly detailed, even listing contributors of used copies of the magazine to be sent to missionaries abroad, 
                        who duly reported back with their gratitude for reports from the parent organization, not to mention their relief for fresh reading to palliate the tedium of their missions. 
                        Readers, in turn, felt they played a part in a worldwide evangelistic effort, regardless of their level of donation 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SIVASUNDARAMPERIODICAL"><persName corresp="#SSIVASUNDARAM">Sivasundaram</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#SIVASUNDARAMPERIODICAL">&#x201C;The Periodical as Barometer&#x201D;</title></ref>, 43&#x2013;48).</p>

                    <p>Such outreach as the "Missionary Chronicle" was characteristic of the <orgName corresp="#LMS">LMS</orgName>&#x02BC;s larger effort in print culture, 
                    which <persName corresp="#AJOHNSTON">Anna Johnston</persName> describes as the construction of &#x201C;a reading audience through its canny manipulation 
                    of textual and media technologies, a readership that would unite religious Britons in a common cause 
                    despite differences of class, region, gender, and age&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JOHNSTONMISSIONARYPUBLISHING">&#x201C;British Missionary Publishing&#x201D;</ref>, 30). 
                    The young <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName> was captured by the excitement, as evidenced by "a theme", 
                    which appears to record a speech or sermon at a meeting of a missionary society. 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was also vulnerable to the appeal of missionary celebrity, as shown by his starstruck enthusiasm 
                        for the poetry and journals of <persName corresp="#RHBC">Reginald Heber, Bishop of <placeName corresp="#CALCUTTA">Calcutta</placeName></persName>.<!-- END NEW MARKUP --></p>
                
                <p>Besides reporting on the missionary activities of the <orgName corresp="#LMS">LMS</orgName>, the <title corresp="periodical">EVANGELICALMAG</title><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi> addressed other interests that probably engaged the Ruskin family. 
                    Each issue contained a section of poetry, albeit usually pious in subject matter; and the January issue routinely 
                    printed poems for the New Year, which may have influenced Ruskin&#x02BC;s custom of composing a <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="new_years_poems.php">New Year&#x02BC;s ode</ref> to be fair&#x2010;copied 
                    and presented to his father on New Year&#x02BC;s. Feature articles mainly concerned religious topics but 
                    occasionally encompassed other areas of knowledge, such as natural history. 
                    A section of book reviews and brief notices of religious publications, including pious works for children, 
                    evidently informed the elder Ruskins&#x02BC; choice of some books for <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>, since some notices correspond to books 
                    that he is known to have owned (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="boyhood_books_note#DESCRIPTIONS">Books Used by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in His Youth&#x2014;Physical Descriptions</ref>). 
                    Among the most prominent features in each issue were lengthy obituaries and biographies of celebrated clergy, 
                    embellished by their engraved portraits, which supplied the sole graphic interest in each issue apart from the engraved banner. 
                    These biographies exposed the reader to peoples, landscapes, and customs of cultures around the world, albeit filtered through the perception of missionaries.</p>
