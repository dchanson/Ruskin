                <head type="title">The <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title></head>
                
                <p>In a letter of <date when="1823-03-03">3 March 1823</date> to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>,
                    <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> mentions receiving this publication 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title>, ed. <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName></ref>, 121). 
                    Her remark does not make clear when the Ruskins&#x02BC; subscription began, 
                    but it might be significant that, with the <date when="1823">1823</date> issues, the magazine initiated volume 1 of a new series.</p>
                
                <p>The <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> was founded in <date when="1793">1793</date> as a nondenominational voice of evangelical culture, 
                    embracing <orgName corresp="#EVANGELICALANGLICANISM">Anglican Evangelicalism</orgName>, Old Dissent, and New Dissent 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ALTHOLZRELIGIOUSPRESS"><persName corresp="JLA">Altholz</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#ALTHOLZRELIGIOUSPRESS"><hi rend="italic">Religious Press in Britain</hi></title></ref>, 45).
                    That spirit of pan&#x2010;evangelical catholicity of opinion and mission was reaffirmed at the start of the new series of the magazine in <date when="1823">1823</date>, 
                    but the position was being tested. A <title type="essay" corresp="#RETROSPECTEVANGELICALMAG">&#x201C;Retrospect&#x201D;</title> published in the first issue of the new series admitted to the emergence of rival denominational publications 
                    on both the <orgName corresp="#EVANGELICALANGLICANISM">Anglican Evangelical</orgName> and <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregational</orgName> sides. In fact, the editorship of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> itself 
                    became dominated by <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalists</orgName>, just as that sect prevailed within the organization that the magazine most prominently represented, 
                    the <orgName corresp="#LMS">London Missionary Society (LMS)</orgName>
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RETROSPECTEVANGELICALMAG"><title type="essay" corresp="#RETROSPECTEVANGELICALMAG">&#x201C;Retrospect of the Former Series of the <hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi>&#x201D;</title></ref>, 1; 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ALTHOLZRELIGIOUSPRESS"><persName corresp="JLA">Altholz</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#ALTHOLZRELIGIOUSPRESS"><hi rend="italic">Religious Press in Britain</hi></title></ref>, 46;

                <p>So much of each issue was given over to news and formal reports of <orgName corresp="#LMS">LMS</orgName> activity that the Ruskins&#x02BC; (or at least <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s)
                    regular reading of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> implies a strong interest in missionary work. 
                    The reports included lists of charitable contributions to the <orgName corresp="#LMS">LMS</orgName>, which, as <persName corresp="#SSIVASUNDARAM">Sujit Sivasundaram</persName> argues, 
                    inspired readers with a collective experience of evangelical zeal. The lists comprised both large and small donations, 
                    even so modest as used copies of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> to be sent to missionaries abroad, 
                    who duly reported back with their gratitude for fresh reading to relieve the tedium of their missions. 
                    Readers therefore felt they played a part in a worldwide evangelistic effort, regardless of their level of donation 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SIVASUNDARAMPERIODICAL"><persName corresp="#SSIVASUNDARAM">Sivasundaram</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#SIVASUNDARAMPERIODICAL">&#x201C;The Periodical as Barometer&#x201D;</title></ref>, 43&#x2013;48).</p>
                
                <p>Such outreach was characteristic of the <orgName corresp="#LMS">LMS</orgName>&#x02BC;s larger effort in print culture, 
                    which <persName corresp="#AJOHNSTON">Anna Johnston</persName> describes as the construction of &#x201C;a reading audience through its canny manipulation 
                    of textual and media technologies, a readership that would unite religious Britons in a common cause 
                    despite differences of class, region, gender, and age&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JOHNSTONMISSIONARYPUBLISHING">&#x201C;British Missionary Publishing&#x201D;</ref>, 30). 
                    The young <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName> was captured by the excitement, as evidenced by <title type="essay"></title>, 
                    which appears to record a speech or sermon at a meeting of a missionary society. 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was also vulnerable to the appeal of missionary celebrity, as shown by his starstruck enthusiasm 
                    for the poetry and journals of <persName corresp="#RHBC">Reginald Heber, Bishop of <placeName corresp="#CALCUTTA">Calcutta</placeName></persName>.</p>
                
                <p>Besides reporting on the missionary activities of the <orgName corresp="#LMS">LMS</orgName>, the <title corresp="periodical">EVANGELICALMAG</title><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi> addressed other interests that probably engaged the Ruskin family. 
                    Each issue contained a section of poetry, albeit strictly pious in subject matter; and the January issue routinely 
                    printed poems for the New Year, which may have influenced Ruskin&#x02BC;s custom of composing a <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="new_years_poems.php">New Year&#x02BC;s ode</ref> to be fair&#x2010;copied 
                    and presented to his father on New Year&#x02BC;;s. Feature articles mainly concerned religious topics but 
                    occasionally encompassed other areas of knowledge, such as natural history. 
                    A section of book reviews and brief notices of religious publications, including pious works for children, 
                    evidently informed the elder Ruskins&#x02BC; choice of some books for <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>, since some notices correspond to books 
                    that he is known to have owned (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="boyhood_books_note#DESCRIPTIONS">Books Used by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in His Youth&#x2014;Physical Descriptions</ref>). 
                    Among the most prominent features in each issue were lengthy obituaries and biographies of celebrated clergy, 
                    embellished by their engraved portraits, which supplied the sole graphic interest in each issue apart from the engraved banner. 
                    These biographies exposed the reader to peoples, landscapes, and customs of cultures around the world, albeit filtered through the perception of missionaries.</p>
