                <p>In a letter of <date when="1823-03-03">3 March 1823</date> to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>,

                <p>The <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> was founded in <date when="1793">1793</date> as a nondenominational voice of evangelical culture,

                    That spirit of pan&#x2010;evangelical catholicity of opinion and mission was reaffirmed at the start of the new series of the magazine in <date when="1823">1823</date>, 
                    but the position was being tested. A <title type="essay" corresp="#RETROSPECTEVANGELICALMAG">&#x201C;Retrospect&#x201D;</title> published in the first issue of the new series admitted to the emergence of rival denominational publications 
                    on both the <orgName corresp="#EVANGELICALANGLICANISM">Anglican Evangelical</orgName> and <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregational</orgName> sides. In fact, the editorship of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> itself

                <p>So much of each issue was given over to the section entitled <hi rend="italic">The Missionary Chronicle</hi> containing news and formal reports of <orgName corresp="#LMS">LMS</orgName> activity 
                    that the Ruskins&#x02BC; (or at least <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s) regular reading of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> 
                    implies a strong interest in missionary work. <!-- NEW MARKUP to end of note -->Indeed, the enthusiasm surrounding foreign missions accounts for a significant part of what tied the Ruskins to <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalism</orgName> at this time, 
                    as documented by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <!-- TITLE AND LINK TO APPARATUS --><ref type="apparatus" target="a_theme_apparatus.php"><title type="essay" corresp="#JRATHEME">&#x201C;a theme&#x201D;</title></ref>, which is a transcript or summary of a meeting for soliciting missionary support. 
                    Their interest can also be measured by the entire family&#x02BC;s eager reading of the journals and poetry of the <persName corresp="#RHBC">Reverend Reginald Heber</persName>, Bishop of <placeName corresp="#CALCUTTA">Calcutta</placeName>. <persName corresp="#RHBC">Heber</persName>&#x02BC;s celebrity 
                    attracted them, as did the rising reputation of the <!-- NAME AND NOTE LINK --><ref type="note" target="andrews_edward_note.php"><persName corresp="#EA">Reverend Dr. Edward Andrews</persName></ref>.</p>
                
                <p>The Ruskins were not uncharacteristic in being bound to <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalism</orgName> by the excitement surrounding foreign missions. 
                    <persName corresp="#STHORNE">Susan Thorne</persName> argues that the commitment to missionary labor was a key to coalescing a middle&#x2010;class identity within <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalism</orgName>. 
                    In the <date notBefore="1767" notAfter="1799">late eighteenth century</date>, <persName corresp="#STHORNE">Thorne</persName> explains, &#x201C;missions were a distinctively middle&#x2010;class alternative to gentry modes of authority, 
                    a means of controlling the lower orders at home as well as abroad that was in direct opposition to traditional or gentry forms of rule&#x201D;. 
                    &#x201C;This is not to say&#x201D;, she goes on, &#x201C;that the missionary language of opposition was antiauthoritarian, much less antinational&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#THORNECONGREGATIONALMISSIONS"><persName corresp="#STHORNE">Thorne</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#THORNECONGREGATIONALMISSIONS"><hi rend="italic">Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture</hi></title></ref>, 39, 43). 
                    The caveat applies especially to the Ruskins, who were not radical Dissenters; nor were the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> the revolutionary <date notBefore="1780" notAfter="1799">1780s and &#x02BC;90s</date>. 
                    It is perhaps telling that, in the second half of the <date notBefore="1825" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, the <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregational</orgName> chapel in <placeName corresp="#CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</placeName> was led by 
                    the <persName corresp="#WO">Reverend William Orme</persName> (<date notBefore="1787" notAfter="1830">1787&#x2013;1830</date>), 
                    who, years earlier, had parted ways with his first mentor, <persName corresp="#RHALDANE">Richard Haldane</persName> (0000&#x2013;00), who was both 
                    &#x201C;one of <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>&#x02BC;s leading advocates of foreign missionary expansion&#x201D; and a fervent supporter of the French Revolution. 
                    Yet despite <persName corresp="#WO">Orme</persName>&#x02BC;s respectability, his congregation in <placeName corresp="#CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</placeName>, if not <persName corresp="#WO">Orme</persName> himself, may have borne too much the air of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#PDMH">Protestant Dissenting Meeting House</placeName>, as it was then called, 
                    as compared with &#x201C;<persName corresp="#EA">Dr. Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s Chapel&#x201D; as described in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title>

                    <p>Foreign missions and middle&#x2010;class identity were interdependent in <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalism</orgName> since the <orgName corresp="#LMS">London Missionary Society</orgName> centered church activity on fund&#x2010;raising for the missions. 
                        The first <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregational</orgName> foreign missions (sent to the South Seas) were funded by a few wealthy patrons, and relied for success on the will of <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#CREATOR">God</persName>. 
                        Fervent but ill&#x2010;equipped and uninformed, these first missions fell apart; and consequently, 
                        the <orgName corresp="#LMS">LMS</orgName> reorganized fundraising on a broader basis, soliciting contributions both large and small, metropolitan and provincial, but most substantially from the urban middle class 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#THORNECONGREGATIONALMISSIONS"><persName corresp="#STHORNE">Thorne</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#THORNECONGREGATIONALMISSIONS"><hi rend="italic">Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture</hi></title></ref>, 59&#x2013;62).
                        The fundraising and network of activities were reported in detail in the <hi rend="italic">Missionary Chronicle</hi> section of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title>. 
                        The published tables of contributions to the <orgName corresp="#LMS">LMS</orgName>, 
                        were calculated, as <persName corresp="#SSIVASUNDARAM">Sujit Sivasundaram</persName> argues, to inspire readers with a collective experience of evangelical zeal. 
                        The lists were observantly detailed, even listing contributors of used copies of the magazine to be sent to missionaries abroad, 
                        who duly reported back with their gratitude for reports from the parent organization, not to mention their relief for fresh reading to palliate the tedium of their missions. 
                        Readers, in turn, felt they played a part in a worldwide evangelistic effort, regardless of their level of donation 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SIVASUNDARAMPERIODICAL"><persName corresp="#SSIVASUNDARAM">Sivasundaram</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#SIVASUNDARAMPERIODICAL">&#x201C;The Periodical as Barometer&#x201D;</title></ref>, 43&#x2013;48).</p>

                    <p>This extensive outreach reported in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> and <hi rend="italic">Missionary Chronicle</hi> was characteristic 
                        of the <orgName corresp="#LMS">LMS</orgName>&#x02BC;s broader effort in print culture beyond the journal. 
                    As <persName corresp="#AJOHNSTON">Anna Johnston</persName> describes its aim, the <orgName corresp="#LMS">LMS</orgName> constructed &#x201C;a reading audience through its canny manipulation 
                    of textual and media technologies, a readership that would unite religious Britons in a common cause 
                    despite differences of class, region, gender, and age&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JOHNSTONMISSIONARYPUBLISHING"><title type="essay" corresp="#JOHNSTONMISSIONARYPUBLISHING">&#x201C;British Missionary Publishing&#x201D;</title></ref>, 30). 
                        Thorne comments also on the breadth of social class comprised within Victorian <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalism</orgName> while also remarking middle&#x2010;class members&#x02BC; shyness of their working&#x2010;class brethren.
                    <!--The young <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName> was captured by the excitement, as evidenced by "a theme", 
                    which appears to record a speech or sermon at a meeting of a missionary society. 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was also vulnerable to the appeal of missionary celebrity, as shown by his starstruck enthusiasm 
                        for the poetry and journals of <persName corresp="#RHBC">Reginald Heber, Bishop of <placeName corresp="#CALCUTTA">Calcutta</placeName></persName> --></p>
                
                    <p>For one middle&#x2010;class family, in any case, the print features of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> probably influenced many productions by the ten&#x2010;year&#x2010;old boy 
                    whom <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> addressed as if he were destined for a sacred mission: &#x201C;You are blessed with a fine Capacity &#x0026; even Genius

The magazine regularly featured a section of poetry, 
                    albeit almost exclusively pious in subject matter; and in particular the January issue routinely 
                    printed poems for the New Year, which may have influenced <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s custom of composing a

                    A section of book reviews and brief notices of religious publications, including pious works for children, 
                    evidently informed the elder Ruskins&#x02BC; choice of some books for <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>, since some notices correspond to books 
                    that he is known to have owned (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="boyhood_books_note#DESCRIPTIONS">Books Used by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in His Youth&#x2014;Physical Descriptions</ref>).</p>

                    These biographies exposed the reader to peoples, landscapes, and customs of cultures around the world, 
                    albeit filtered through the perception of missionaries.</p>
