                <p>In a <title type="letter" corresp="mr_to_jjr_1823-03-03">letter of <date when="1823-03-03">3 March 1823</date> to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName></title>,
                    <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> mentions receiving this publication 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title>, ed. <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName></ref>, 121). 
                    Her remark does not make clear when the Ruskins&#x02BC; subscription began, 
                    but it might be significant that, with the <date when="1823">1823</date> issues, the magazine initiated volume one of a new series.</p>
                
                <p>The magazine supplies context for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s juvenilia, for example by reflecting the family&#x02BC;s zeal for missionary causes 
                    (see, e.g., <ref type="apparatus" target="a_theme_apparatus.php"><title type="essay" corresp="#JRATHEME">&#x201C;a theme&#x201D;</title></ref>) and the character of their <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregational</orgName> worship. 
                    The magazine was also an influential source of elements of print culture, for example by supplying models for compiling, entitling, and fair&#x2010;copying poetry anthologies, and for specific kinds of poems, 
                    especially <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="new_years_poems_note">New Year&#x02BC;s Poems</ref>.</p>
                
                <p>Feature articles mainly concerned religious topics but occasionally encompassed other areas of knowledge, such as natural history. 
                    A section of book reviews and brief notices of religious publications, including pious works for children, 
                    evidently informed the elder Ruskins&#x02BC; choice of some books for <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>, since some notices correspond to books 
                    that he is known to have owned (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="boyhood_books_note#DESCRIPTIONS">Books Used by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in His Youth&#x2014;Physical Descriptions</ref>).</p>
                
                <p>Prominent in each issue were lengthy obituaries and biographies of celebrated clergy, 
                    embellished by their engraved portraits, which supplied the sole graphic interest in each issue apart from the engraved banner. 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s clergyman and tutor, the <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="andrews_edward_note.php#">Reverend Dr. <persName corresp="#EA">Edward Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s</ref>, 
                    was featured in one of these full&#x2010;page engravings. The biographies exposed the reader to peoples, landscapes, and customs of cultures around the world, 
                    albeit filtered through the perception of missionaries.</p>

                    <p>The <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> was founded in <date when="1793">1793</date> as a non&#x2010;denominational voice of evangelical culture,

                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ALTHOLZRELIGIOUSPRESS"><persName corresp="JLA">Altholz</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#ALTHOLZRELIGIOUSPRESS"><hi rend="italic">Religious Press in Britain</hi></title></ref>, 45). 
                        In the preface to the first issue, the magazine situates itself in a world of advancing literacy in which &#x201C;it will be a rare thing to find a beggar in the land who has not been taught to read&#x201D; and in which 
                        &#x201C;[t]housands read a Magazine, who have neither money to purchase, nor leisure to peruse, large volumes&#x201D;. Yet, this progress is co&#x2010;opted by 
                        &#x201C;a certain description of writers&#x201D; who, &#x201C;by monopolizing a work of this kind, have made more converts to their opinions, and done more mischief to the cause of religion, than all the folios of <persName corresp="#FSOZZINI">Socinus</persName> 
                        [i.e., <orgName corresp="#SOCINIANISM">Socinianism</orgName>]&#x201D;. To counter this influence, the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> will convey &#x201C;the collected knowledge and experience of various Ministers and <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christians</orgName>&#x201D; 
                        in a form that is level &#x201C;to every one&#x02BC;s capacity, and suited to every one&#x02BC;s time and circumstances&#x201D;, as &#x201C;elucidated&#x201D; by the &#x201C;fundamental doctrines of the Gospel&#x201D; 
                        and by &#x201C;the lives and experience of eminent <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christians</orgName>&#x201D;&#x2014;that is, &#x201C;Experimental and Practical Theology&#x201D;. On a more learned level, against the more &#x201C;artful attacks of atheistical philosophers&#x201D; 
                        and &#x201C;infidel and illiberal critics&#x201D;, the magazine will undertake &#x201C;a manly and impartial Review of Religious Books&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PREFACEEVANGELICALMAG1793-01"><title type="essay" corresp="#PREFACEEVANGELICALMAG1793-01">&#x201C;Preface&#x201D;</title> [<date when="1793-01">January 1793</date>]</ref>, 1&#x2013;2).</p>
                    
                    <p>In its aspiration to represent a catholicity of evangelical aims and opinion based on experiential religion, the magazine was oriented to a broad movement 
                        for evangelical union that originated in the Great Awakening of the eighteenth century. In <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>, the movement was forwarded in the <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1810">first decade of the nineteenth century</date> 
                        by the preaching and organizational efforts of the Haldane brothers, <persName corresp="#RHALDANE">Robert</persName> (<date notBefore="1764" notAfter="1842">1764&#x2013;1842</date>) and <persName corresp="#JAHALDANE">James</persName> (<date notBefore="1768" notAfter="1851">1768&#x2013;1851</date>). Their organizing was associated with the rise 
                        of Scottish <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalism</orgName>&#x2014;the worship that the Ruskins favored in their first decades in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>&#x2014;and in their preaching, the Haldanes were partnered by English <orgName corresp="#EVANGELICALISM">evangelicals</orgName>, 
                        <persName corresp="#CSIMEON">Charles Simeon</persName> (<date notBefore="1759" notAfter="1836">1759&#x2013;1836</date>) and <persName corresp="#RHREV">Rowland Hill</persName> (<date notBefore="1744" notAfter="1833">1744&#x2013;1833</date>). Their itinerant preaching tours took in central <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>, especially <placeName corresp="#PERTHSHIRE">Perthshire</placeName>, 
                        where <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s sister, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_jessie_note.php"><persName corresp="#JRP">Jessie</persName></ref>, eventually settled. Throughout central and northern <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>, 
                        <persName corresp="#RHALDANE">Robert</persName> funded the establishment of independent chapels or <hi rend="italic">tabernacles</hi>, including the three&#x2010;thousand&#x2010;seat 
                        <placeName type="building" corresp="#LEITHWALKTABERNACLE">Leith Walk Tabernacle</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName>&#x2014;a large place of worship that, like <persName corresp="#RHREV">Hill</persName>&#x02BC;s <placeName type="building" corresp="#SURREYCHAPEL">Surrey Chapel</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#BLACKFRIARS">Blackfriars</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, 
                        and the <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="andrews_edward_note.php#">Reverend Dr. <persName corresp="#EA">Edward Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s</ref> <placeName type="building" corresp="#BERESFORDCHAPEL">Beresford Chapel</placeName>, which the Ruskins attended, was 
                        built to occupy a space between <orgName corresp="#EVANGELICALISM">evangelicalism</orgName> and the church establishment. Nonetheless, in <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>, the Haldanes&#x02BC; evangelical fervor and criticism 
                        nettled the ministers of the <orgName corresp="#CHURCHOFSCOTLAND">Church of Scotland</orgName>, whose pulpits the Haldanes and their associates often borrowed during their itinerant tours. 
                        Moreover, a social division prevailed between the populist movement and the more formally educated and conservative 
                        clergy of the established church, the kirk. (<persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s mother, <persName corresp="#CTWR">Catherine</persName>, was the daughter of a minister of the <orgName corresp="#CHURCHOFSCOTLAND">Church of Scotland</orgName>.) 
                        <persName corresp="#RHALDANE">Robert Haldane</persName>, in particular, provoked conservatives early in his career by fomenting his advocacy of principles of the French Revolution. 
                        Eventually, the Haldanes splintered their movement owing to their conversion to <orgName corresp="#BAPTISM">Baptism</orgName>, among other reasons, but this latter development appears only marginally 
                        connected to the Ruskins&#x02BC; experience of <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregational</orgName> worship in the suburbs south of <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BROWNELLHALDANES"><persName corresp="#KBROWNELL">Brownell</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#BROWNELLHALDANES">&#x201C;Robert and James Haldane and the Quest for Evangelical Union&#x201D;</title></ref>;

                    <p>Despite the pull for unity, the <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregational</orgName> wing of the <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1834">early nineteenth century</date> was firmly <orgName corresp="#CALVINISM">Calvinist</orgName> in theology; and in keeping with that emphasis, 
                        the <date when="1793">1793</date> preface to volume one of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> proudly numbers among the &#x201C;persons of evangelical principles in the kingdom&#x201D; currently 
                        &#x201C;three hundred thousand <orgName corresp="#CALVINISM">Calvinists</orgName>&#x201D; while perhaps nodding distantly to the <orgName corresp="#METHODISM">Arminian Wesleyans</orgName> among the &#x201C;many others, savingly converted to <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#CREATOR">God</persName>, 
                        who trust in the merits of <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName> alone for salvation&#x201D;. Still, the magazine pronounces itself &#x201C;devoid of personality and acrimonious reflections 
                        on any sect of professing <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christians</orgName>&#x201D; and commits to including both &#x201C;Churchmen and Dissenters&#x201D; among the team of &#x201C;twenty&#x2010;four Ministers&#x201D; who serve as editors and contributors. 
                        The editorial approach is to amass a &#x201C;collected knowledge&#x201D;, drawn not only from the ecumenical panel of editors but also from readers, 
                        whose &#x201C;judicious pieces&#x201D; are invited for submission, &#x201C;especially well&#x2010;authenticated accounts of triumphant deaths, and remarkable providences&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PREFACEEVANGELICALMAG1793-01">&#x201C;Preface&#x201D; [<date when="1793-01">January 1793</date>]</ref>, 1&#x2013;3). 
                        Thus, whereas the Ruskins were not magazine readers by necessity&#x2014;since they ranked comfortably among those with &#x201C;money to purchase&#x201D;, and &#x201C;leisure to peruse, large volumes&#x201D; 
                        denied to many among the magazine&#x02BC;s target audience&#x2014;<persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> was exposed to an early Victorian model of crowdsourcing in print culture.</p> 
                        
                    <p>Addressing younger readers, &#x201C;the children of religious parents&#x201D;, the magazine offers to &#x201C;allure&#x201D; them &#x201C;through pleasure, 
                        into the paths of true wisdom&#x201D; by means of entertaining genres such as &#x201C;Biography, Memoirs, Diaries, Authentic Anecdotes, 
                        Striking Providences, and the expressions of Dying <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christians</orgName>&#x201D;. Add to these life&#x2010;writing genres the magazine&#x02BC;s single feature of visual art, 
                        the engraved portraits that accompany the lead biographies in each issue, these attractions cannot fail to &#x201C;arrest the mind&#x201D; and &#x201C;make a deep impression&#x201D; on young persons, 
                        while the more exciting reading is tempered by sober instruction in &#x201C;Ecclesiastical History, <orgName corresp="#JUDAISM">Jewish</orgName> and <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christian</orgName> Antiquities, Sacred Criticism, 
                        Select Sentences, Short Poems, and Natural Philosophy&#x201D;. Thus, on the one hand &#x201C;charmed&#x201D; with the testimony of 
                        &#x201C;the illustrious virtues and rich experience of those very people whom the world has treated with contempt&#x201C;
                        and on the other hand &#x201C;impressed with admiration of the works of <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#CREATOR">God</persName>&#x201D;, young readers 
                        &#x201C;will insensibly be led to examine the far superior displays of divine perfections, and the foundation of <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christian</orgName> hope and practice&#x201D;

                        A <title type="essay" corresp="#RETROSPECTEVANGELICALMAG">&#x201C;Retrospect&#x201D;</title> published in the first issue of the new series

                        and <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregational</orgName> sides. In fact, the editorship of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> 
                        had itself become dominated by <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalists</orgName>, just as that sect held increasing sway over the organization 
                        that the magazine prominently represented, the <orgName corresp="#LMS">London Missionary Society (LMS)</orgName>

                    <p>Starting in <date when="1813">1813</date>, the magazine expanded its title to the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine and Missionary Chronicle</hi></title>,
                        having already begun in previous issues to devote &#x201C;a fifth of their pages to . . . religious information, under the title of <hi rend="italic">The Missionary Chronicle</hi>; 
                        which includes the Proceedings of all Societies instituted for the spread of the gospel&#x201D; but especially the activities of the <orgName corresp="#LMS">LMS</orgName> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PREFACEEVANGELICALMAG1813-12">&#x201C;Preface&#x201D; [<date when="1813-12-12">12 December 1813</date>]</ref>, iii&#x2013;iv). 
                        So prominent and detailed are the reports of <orgName corresp="#LMS">LMS</orgName> activity that the Ruskins&#x02BC; (or at least <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s) regular reading of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title> 
                        necessarily implies a strong interest in missionary work. Indeed, the enthusiasm surrounding foreign missions appears to account for a significant part of what tied the Ruskins to <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalism</orgName> at this time, 
                        as documented by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <ref type="apparatus" target="a_theme_apparatus.php"><title type="essay" corresp="#JRATHEME">&#x201C;a theme&#x201D;</title></ref>, which is a transcript or summary of a meeting for soliciting support of missionary work. 
                        The Ruskins&#x02BC; interest in missions can also be measured by the entire family&#x02BC;s eager reading of the journals and poetry of the <persName corresp="#RHBC">Reverend Reginald Heber, Bishop of <placeName corresp="#CALCUTTA">Calcutta</placeName></persName>. 
                        They were drawn to <persName corresp="#RHBC">Heber</persName>&#x02BC;s celebrity, just as they were impressed by the rising reputation of the 
                        <ref type="note" target="andrews_edward_note.php"><persName corresp="#EA">Reverend Dr. Edward Andrews</persName></ref>, who likewise encouraged the missionary cause.</p>
                    
                <p>The Ruskins were not uncharacteristic in being bound to <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalism</orgName> by the excitement surrounding foreign missions. 
                    The spread of the gospel to foreign places was regarded as a key motivation driving the pan&#x2010;evangelical spirit that united <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalism</orgName> 
                    with the broader <orgName corresp="#EVANGELICALISM">Evangelical</orgName> Revival. As the <orgName corresp="#EVANGELICALANGLICANISM">Anglican</orgName> and <orgName corresp="#METHODISM">Methodist</orgName>&#x2010;leaning clergyman and missionary, <persName corresp="#MHORNE">Melville Horne</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1761" notAfter="1841">1761&#x2013;1841</date>), put the case 
                    for a unified British <orgName corresp="#PROTESTANTISM">Protestant</orgName> missionary enterprise: &#x201C;I would not have him [the British missionary] indifferent to his own peculiarities, 
                    whether they respect the doctrines he receives as truth, or the points of ecclesiastical polity he considers most friendly to religion; 
                    but I would have him thoroughly sensible, that the success of his ministry rests not on points of separation, but on those wherein all godly men are united. . . . 
                    His object is to serve the Church Universal&#x201D; (<title type="book" corresp="#HORNELETTERS"><hi rend="italic">Letters on Missions</hi></title> [<date when="1794">1794</date>], quoted in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BROWNELLHALDANES"><persName corresp="#KBROWNELL">Brownell</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#BROWNELLHALDANES">&#x201C;Robert and James Haldane and the Quest for Evangelical Union&#x201D;</title></ref>, 7).</p>
                    
                    <p>Even more fundamentally, the commitment to missionary labor was, as <persName corresp="#STHORNE">Susan Thorne</persName> argues, 
                        key to coalescing a middle&#x2010;class identity within <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalism</orgName>. 
                        In the <date notBefore="1767" notAfter="1799">late eighteenth century</date>, <persName corresp="#STHORNE">Thorne</persName> explains, &#x201C;missions [both home and foreign] were a distinctively middle&#x2010;class alternative to gentry modes of authority, 
                    a means of controlling the lower orders at home as well as abroad that was in direct opposition to traditional or gentry forms of rule&#x201D;. 
                    &#x201C;This is not to say&#x201D;, she goes on, &#x201C;that the missionary language of opposition was antiauthoritarian, much less antinational&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#THORNECONGREGATIONALMISSIONS"><persName corresp="#STHORNE">Thorne</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#THORNECONGREGATIONALMISSIONS"><hi rend="italic">Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture</hi></title></ref>, 39, 43). 
                        The latter caveat applies especially to the Ruskins, whose middle&#x2010;class, evangelical identity had no stake in radical Dissent<!-- nor were the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> the revolutionary <date notBefore="1780" notAfter="1799">1780s and &#x02BC;90s</date>-->, 
                        and whose loyalties probably adhered more to a national Protestant and anti&#x2010;Roman Catholic sense of mission than a sectarian Dissenter spirit. 
                        There appears no mention of the Ruskins attending the <placeName type="building" corresp="#PDMH">Protestant Dissenting Meeting House</placeName>, 
                        as a <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregational</orgName> chapel was called in their neighborhood of <placeName corresp="#CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</placeName> 
                        in the second half of the <date notBefore="1825" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>. That congregation was led by 
                        the <persName corresp="#WO">Reverend William Orme</persName> (<date notBefore="1787" notAfter="1830">1787&#x2013;1830</date>), 
                        who had parted ways with his first mentor, <persName corresp="#RHALDANE">Robert Haldane</persName>, in their Perth years, 
                        when Haldane was known both as &#x201C;one of <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>&#x02BC;s leading advocates of foreign missionary expansion&#x201D; and as a fervent supporter of the French Revolution. 
                        Was <persName corresp="#WO">Orme</persName>&#x02BC;s respectability insufficient to dispel an air of working&#x2010;class Dissent surrounding a "Protestant Meeting House"? 
                        The Ruskins drove a longer distance to attend &#x201C;<persName corresp="#EA">Dr. Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s Chapel&#x201D; as the Beresford Street Chapel was identified in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title>

                    <p>Foreign missions and middle&#x2010;class identity were interdependent in <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalism</orgName> in part because the <orgName corresp="#LMS">London Missionary Society</orgName> centered church activity on fundraising for the missions. 
                        The first <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregational</orgName> foreign missions (sent to the South Seas) were funded by a few wealthy patrons, as tended to be the case in other churches, and relied for success on the will of <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#CREATOR">God</persName>. 
                        Fervent but ill&#x2010;equipped and uninformed, these first missions fell apart; and consequently, 
                        the <orgName corresp="#LMS">LMS</orgName> reorganized fundraising on a broader basis, soliciting contributions both large and small, metropolitan and provincial, but most substantially from the urban middle class 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#THORNECONGREGATIONALMISSIONS"><persName corresp="#STHORNE">Thorne</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#THORNECONGREGATIONALMISSIONS"><hi rend="italic">Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture</hi></title></ref>, 59&#x2013;62).
                        The fundraising and network of related activities were reported in detail in the <hi rend="italic">Missionary Chronicle</hi> section of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#EVANGELICALMAG"><hi rend="italic">Evangelical Magazine</hi></title>. 
                        The published tables of contributions to the <orgName corresp="#LMS">LMS</orgName>, along with reports of activities in the local and regional auxiliary <orgName corresp="#LMS">LMS</orgName> societies, 
                        were calculated, as <persName corresp="#SSIVASUNDARAM">Sujit Sivasundaram</persName> argues, to inspire readers with a collective experience of evangelical zeal. 
                        The lists were observantly detailed, even listing contributors of used copies of the magazine to be sent to missionaries abroad, 
                        who duly reported back with their gratitude to receive reports from the parent and auxiliary organizations, not to mention their relief for fresh reading to palliate the tedium of their missions. 
                        Readers, in turn, felt they played a part in a worldwide evangelistic effort, regardless of their level of donation
