                <p><persName corresp="#RMG">Grindlay</persName> was an amateur artist, whose drawings formed the basis of engravings and aquatints published by <ref type="notes" target="smith_elder_note.php"><orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder &#x0026; Company</orgName></ref>. 
                    <persName corresp="#RMG">Grindlay</persName>&#x02BC;s major book, <title type="book" corresp="#GRINDLAYINDIA"><hi rend="italic">Scenery, Costumes and Architecture, Chiefly on the Western Side of India</hi></title>, 
                    which contained thirty&#x2010;six aquatint prints (not all of them based on <persName corresp="#RMG">Grindlay</persName>&#x02bc;s drawings), was published between <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1830">1826 and 1830</date>. 
                    Its first two parts were produced by <persName corresp="#RAP">Rudolph Ackermann</persName>, and its remaining four parts by <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>. 
                    A sketch by <persName corresp="#RMG">Grindlay</persName>from travel in <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> also was worked into an engraving for <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder&#x02bc;s</orgName> annual, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php">Friendship&#x02bc;s Offering</ref>, in <date when="1830">1830</date> (see <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="saltzburg_apparatus.php#DISCUSSION">Saltzburg: Discussion</ref>).</p>
                
                <p>From <date when="1803">1803</date>, <persName corresp="#RMG">Grindlay</persName> served in the <orgName corresp="#EASTINDIACO">East India Company</orgName>&#x02bc;s military service (Bombay Native Infantry), and in other official positions, 
                    which enabled him to travel extensively throughout western <placeName corresp="#INDIA">India</placeName> and record the sights in sketches. 
                    Returning to <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName> in <date when="1817">1817</date> and retiring from the service in <date when="1820">1820</date>, 
                    <persName corresp="#RMG">Grindlay</persName> founded a <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> agency, <orgName corresp="#LESLIEGRINDLAY">Leslie &#x0026; Grindlay</orgName>, in <date when="1828">1828</date>, which managed shipping and passenger travel to and from <placeName corresp="#INDIA">India</placeName>. 
                    The agency, which eventually grew into the major Anglo&#x2010;Indian banking firm named for him, <orgName corresp="#LESLIEGRINDLAY">Grindlay&#x02bc;s</orgName>, was originally situated in Birchin Lane, 
                    near the second location of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>, at 65, Cornhill 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROHATGIPARLETTINDIANLIFE"> <persName corresp="#PROHATGI">Rohatgi</persName> and <persName corresp="#GPARLETT">Parlett</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#ROHATGIPARLETTINDIANLIFE"><hi rend="italic">Indian Life and Landscape by Western Artists</hi></title></ref>, 213&#x2013;16;

                    As both <orgName corresp="#LESLIEGRINDLAY">Leslie &#x0026; Grindlay</orgName> and <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> dealt in Anglo&#x2010;Indian travel and trade, it seems likely that <persName corresp="#RMG">Grindlay</persName> and <persName corresp="#AE">Alexander Elder</persName> were brought together 
                    by their shared artistic as well as business interests.</p>
                
                <p>The production of Scenery, Costumes and Architecture, closely supervised by <persName corresp="#RMG">Grindlay</persName>, drew on a small army of artists, engravers, and aquatint specialists 
                    (some of whom, such as the artists <persName corresp="#WDANIELL">William Daniell</persName> and <persName corresp="#WPPAINTER">William Purser</persName>, also produced work for <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder&#x02bc;s</orgName> <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02bc;s Offering</hi></title>). 
                    The publication must have marked a significant milestone for <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder&#x02bc;s</orgName> comparatively young publishing division, since <persName corresp="#PROHATGI">Pauline Rohatgi</persName> rates the work 
                    &#x201c;among the finest illustrated books ever produced&#x201d;, achieving a &#x201c;perfection of the aquatint printing process&#x201d;, which was notable in this case for 
                    &#x201c;an unusually wide range of coloured inks used in the actual printing, with the result that hardly any additional hand&#x2010;colouring was needed to complete the effect&#x201d;
