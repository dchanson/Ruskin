                <head type="title">The System of Title Citation for Works</head>
                <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s practice of writing a given title in manuscript is explained in the &#x201C;Title&#x201D; section of each Works Apparatus Page and can be observed
                    in the facsimile of the manuscript, if available (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="plan_of_archive_note.php">The Plan of the Archive</ref>). But
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s practices of entitling texts are so inconsistent that the reader would be confused by routine citation of literally transcribed titles.
                    For example, because in some instances <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> capitalized important words in titles but in other instances did not, the latter would, when cited out of
                    context, be indistinguishable from first&#x2010;line citations; and at the same time, first&#x2010;line citation is necessary for texts that otherwise have no titles.
                    Therefore, for purposes of routine citation throughout the <hi rend="italic">Early Ruskin Manuscripts</hi>, each text is assigned a regularized title according
                    to the following set of conventions.
                    <list type="ordered">
                        <item n="a"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own titles for poetry and prose are distinguished by quotation marks. First and important words are capitalized, and
                            spelling regularized, regardless of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own practice. Generally, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s complete titles are given, except when
                            very long titles prove impractical for routine purposes of hyperlinking; and in those cases, some reasonable short form is substituted, such as
                            <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1"><hi rend="bold">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</hi></title> replacing (were the rule being followed strictly) 
                            <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1"><hi rend="bold">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy Concluded, Being the Last Part of Early Lessons, in Four Volumes, Vol. 1, with Copper Plates, Printed and Composed by a Little Boy and Also Drawn&#x201D;.</hi></title></item>
                        <item n="b">Untitled poems are cited by their first lines, which are likewise placed in quotation marks, but with only the first word and proper nouns capitalized.</item>
                        <item n="c">When <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> assigned more than one and differing titles to witnesses of the same work, rule no. 1 applies, and the separate titles are joined by
                            <hi rend="italic">and</hi>, thus: <hi rend="bold">&#x201C;The Shipwreck&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">and</hi> &#x201C;A Shipwreck&#x201D;.</hi> <!--DCH: Are these actual titles?--> Hyperlinks to such works are, however, for
                            convenience, named by only one of these joined titles&#x2014;the link taking the reader to the &#x201C;Title&#x201D; section of the Works Apparatus Page of the work in
                            question, where the complexity is fully explained.</item>
                        <item n="d">When <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> assigned the same title to different works (e.g. there are more than one poem named
                            &#x201C;A Fragment&#x201D;; more than one named &#x201C;A Psalm&#x201D;), rule no. 1 applies, and the titles (if of poems)
                            are followed by first&#x2010;line citations in parentheses, following the conventions in rule no. 2.</item>
                        <item n="e">When rules 1&#x2013;4 fail to establish clarity in particular instances, square brackets are used following the main title to supply
                            the necessary distinctions. For example:
                            <list type="ordered">
                                <item n="e.1"><!-- NEW e.1 -->Titles that were invented by later editors (e.g., by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="collingwood_w_g_note.php"><persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName></ref>

                                    capitalized. The use of square brackets for this purpose was established by <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> 
                                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS4D1891"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, <date when="1891">1891</date>]</ref>, 1: xxv;

                                    and the editors of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title></ref> 
                                    followed suit (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 2: xxxvi). 
                                    Both editions, however, proved inconsistent in maintaining this practice.</item>
                                <item n="e.2">Works that share the same or similar titles but that cannot be distinguished by citation of a first line (e.g., because they
                                    are not poems) are given distinguishing information in square brackets. For example, prose works with similar titles, such as
                                    &#x201C;A Sermon,&#x201D; are followed by the opening words of the text in square brackets, thus:

                            or in the case of a long poem that lacks a main title but that consists of multiple parts, each part carrying its own title or needing to be cited
                            by the first line&#x2014;these works are given titles without quotation marks, and with first and important words capitalized. For example:
                            <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR"><hi rend="bold">Account of a Tour of the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName></hi></title>. Where possible, these descriptive titles are drawn from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s habitual way of referring to
                            the works, albeit not on the manuscript itself (e.g., in his letters, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> refers to the &#x201C;Mineralogical Dictionary,&#x201D; although no such
                            title appears on the manuscript of that work). Another kind of example calling for this kind of descriptive title is a poem that has been all but
                            obliterated, rendering illegible both <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own title (if any existed) along with the first line that might have served by rule no. 2. For example: 
                            <hi rend="bold">Poem on Mr. Rowbotham</hi>.
                        </item>
                        <item n="g">The preceding rules apply also to titles of groups.</item>
