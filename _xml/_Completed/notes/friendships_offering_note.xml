                    <p>The first volume of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> appeared with the date <date when="1824">1824</date>,

                        The Ruskin family had some awareness of this early stage of the annual, since the volume for 1825, Relfe's second volume in the series, entered the family library 
                        with an inscription to <!-- TAG FOR BIO NOTE -->Mary Richardson (1815-49), Ruskin's cousin who first came to Camberwell to live with the family in 1827 
                        (Dearden, Library of John Ruskin, 122 [no. 953]; and for specific features of the 1825 Friendship's Offering, see Harris, "Feminizing the Textual Body", 601-2, 611).</p>

                        <p>As <persName corresp="#KDH">Katherine D. Harris</persName> remarks, Relfe's first volume, for 1824, appeared only one year after the very first of the British annuals, 
                        <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi> (<date when="1823">1823</date>)</title>, 
                        was released by the firm of <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Rudolf Ackermann</orgName> in <date when="1822">1822</date> for the holiday season of <date notBefore="1822-11" notAfter="1823-02">1822&#x2013;23</date>. 
                        Harris transcribes the preface of this debut volume of Friendship's Offering and details the volume's contents, revealing a derivative and miscellaneous assemblage that exposes <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName> 
                        as aspiring only to mimic and capitalize on Ackermann's achievement. He had formed no distinctive conception of his production, which mixes features of the German literary annual, on which Ackermann modeled Forget Me Not, with traditional elements of the English eighteenth&#x2010;century almanac and &#x201C;pocket book&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title></ref>, 124-25, 280;

                            <p>Relfe's inclusion of pocket-book features such as blank diary pages did not necessarily suggest incoherence: as Sara Lodge has noted, during the post-Waterloo period Leigh Hunt 
                        produced an item, the <hi rend="italic">Literary Pocket-Book</hi> (1818-22), which invited the consumer to inscribe poetic effusions on a blank "Calendar of Nature", thus activating the reader to put literary response to use in constructing, as Hunt put it, 
                                "a sort of Court Calendar" of one's own (Lodge, &#x201C;Romantic Reliquaries&#x201D;, 25). Nonetheless, Relfe initially seems to have had trouble positioning his annual to respond to the conflicting audience demands of the transitional, post-Waterloo period. 
                                In <date when="1858">1858</date>, when the history of the annuals began to be written following their decline in popularity, an article in the <hi rend="italic">Bookseller</hi> settled on the opinion that <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>&#x02BC;s Friendship's Offering 
                            was characterized by an &#x201C;unpromising&#x201D; mix of "ruled pages for memoranda" with "indifferent views of Continental cities", "poor verses", and the occasional "tale by Mrs. Opie" (i.e., Amelia Opie [1769-1853]) 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ANNUALSOFFORMERDAYS"><title type="annual" corresp="#ANNUALSOFFORMERDAYS">&#x201C;The Annuals of Former Days&#x201D;</title></ref>, 496).</p>
                        
                    <p>According to the Bookseller article, the fortunes of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> were turned around by 
                        by the editorship of <persName corresp="#TKH">T. K. Hervey</persName> (<date notBefore="1799" notAfter="1859">1799&#x2013;1859</date>). 
                        In his prefatory remarks for Relfe's <date when="1826">1826</date> volume, <persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName><!-- Pleading &#x201C;difficulties&#x201D; that arose from the publication having only &#x201C;very recently, come into the present Editor&#x02BC;s hands" 
                        (<persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName> had in fact edited the title since <date when="1824">1824</date>), he--> did announce "a view to an entire change in . . . [the annual's] character and plan&#x201D;, 
                        shifting emphasis from the transience of an annual to the permanence of a keepsake: the &#x201C;alterations" were to "consist in the removal of all those features which marked it as more peculiarly adapted for one season of the year than another&#x201d;. 
                        Instead, the annual would become a more permanent, treasurable item, &#x201C;combining, with the increased beauty of its embellishments, a high literary character&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName>, ed., <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> [<date when="1826">1826</date>]</ref>, vi). 
                        Thus, according to <persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, the pocket-book features of Relfe's earlier volumes such as blank calendar pages, informational charts, and even notated music fell away 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title></ref>, 126); and 
                        while these earlier "album-like qualities" did have the merit of allowing the giver and the recipient to personalize the volume with their own inscriptions, 
                        a "more marketable" item emerged for the period, one that required the annual to became a "completely prefabricated book of printed memories" 
                        (Harris, "Feminizing the Textual Body", 607).</p>

                            <head type="sub-subsection">The Hervey Editorship: Improving the Literary Character</head>
                        
                        <p>What signaled the improved "literary character" promised by Hervey? 
                            As star material for the <date when="1826">1826</date> volume, Maria Edgeworth (1769-1849) supplied an essay by her father, 
                            Richard Lovell Edgeworth (1744-1817); 
                            Washington Irving (1783-1859) and Lady Caroline Lamb (1785-1828) 
                            released scraps of verse by Lord Byron (1788-1824); 
                            and juvenilia were recovered by James Thomson (1700-1748). 
                            Otherwise, the roster of contributors for the <date when="1826">1826</date> volume proved similar to those for 1827.
                            One or both volumes included poet/churchmen such as the Reverend Thomas Dale (1797-1870), Ruskin's future Camberwell schoolmaster, and 
                            the Reverend George Croly (1780-1860), Ruskin's future mentor. This class of writers also included the Reverend John Moultrie (1799-1874), the Rugby rector; 
                            and James Montgomery (1771-1854), the hymn writer. Among "poetesses" appeared L.E.L. (Letitia Landon, 1802-38) and--a poetess 
                            especially favored in the Ruskin household--Felicia Hemans (1793-1835). Among women writers of tales and sketches appeared 
                            Mary Russell Mitford (1787-1855) and Emma Roberts (1791-1840).</p>
                            
                        <p>These and other contributors to the 1826 and 1827 volumes of Friendship's Offering were, as reviewers commented, almost invariable presences in other annuals, as well--writers 
                            who supplied mainly verse, but who could also be relied on for a variety of commissions: Bernard Barton (1784-1849), John Clare (1793-1864), 
                            Allan Cunningham (1784-1842), Hervey, William Jerdan (1782-1869), 
                            Henry Neele (1798-1828), D. Lester Richardson (1801-65), and the translator John Bowring (1792-1872). 
                            Relief from the sentiments of such verse came from humorists like John Galt (1779-1839), Thomas Hood (1799-1845), and Horace Smith (1779-1849). 
                            Many of these contributors themselves labored as editors of other annuals, magazines, and newspapers, including Ruskin's future personal editor, 
                            <!-- link note -->W. H. Harrison (1792-1878), who appeared the for the first time in the Friendship's Offering for 1827.</p>
                            
                            <p>Thus the "improved literary character" of Friendship's Offering succeeded in rendering the volume more predictable. 
                                The Monthly Review commented about the 1826 volume: "Wher e the character of this volume so closely corresponds to that of the '[Literary] Souvenir'", reviewed in a previous issue for that year, 
                                "our general remarks may apply to either" (REVIEWANNUALS1826MONTHLY Unsigned review of <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi> [1826] and <hi rend="italic">Janus</hi> [1826], 161). 
                                Regarding the following year's volume, that journal judged the "prose matter . . . [to be] upon the whole, the best that we have seen in any of these annual volumes", 
                                but "after three or four pieces from the pens of Miss Landon, Mrs. Hemans, the Rev. Mr. Dale, and Mr. Hervey, 
                                we find nothing in the shape of verse, that rises above mediocrity" 
                                (REVIEWANNUALS1827MONTHLY Unsigned review of <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi> [1827], 87). 
                                The contributors represented cultures of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, 
                                as well as lived experience from abroad, sometimes writing in dialect. They wrote from a variety of religious and ideological stances, 
                                though never so aggressively as to perturb the unifying script of friendship, sentiment, and memory.</p>
                            
                            <p>When reviewers found little to distinguish Friendship's Offering from other annuals, they turned to the "embellishments" 
                                of illustration for comparisons, usually considered overall to be to the disadvantage of Relfe's volume 
                                (see MISC1826BELLEASSEMBLEE &#x201C;Miscellaneous&#x201D; [Unsigned review of <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi> (1827)], 300;

                                The annual was in fact typical of the period in highlighting the shared "poetry" of the Sister Arts 
                                (see <ref type="internal" target="#POETRYOFSISTERARTS">Illustration: The Poetry of the Sister Arts in the <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName> Annual</ref>); 
                                and the 1826 volume stands out for its sampling of contemporary French art, but reviews at the time were mixed 
                                (see <ref type="internal" target="#RELFEFRENCHILLUSTRATI0N">Illustration: A Reflection of the Contest between the British Picturesque Aesthetic and French Neoclassweicism in the 1826 <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName> Annual</ref>). 
                                The future success of Friendship's Offering depended on finding a niche that made the annual distinctive in an increasingly crowded field, 
                                but without disturbing the superficially various yet predictable offering of memory and friendship.</p></div>

                            at the same time, the keepsake element was enhanced with redesign of the presentation plate, which, as the Monthly Review appreciated, in some annuals "scarcely allowed" space "for the names of the 'donor' and 'donee' 
                            . . . [b]ut here [gave] full room even for a verse or two of compliment"

                        <p>The reviewer for the Monthly Review was impressed by the quality of illustration in Smith, Elder's first volume, 
                            suggesting that the company had already earned its reputation for high-quality art reproduction: 
                            the plates were "really very creditable to the publishers", their "subjects . . . selected with great judgment" and "engraved in a chaste, artist-like style"

                        <p>The London Magazine praised the 1828 Friendship's Offering for its collective "cheerful gaiety", identifying its contributors as 
                            "chiefly formed from a <hi rend="italic">set</hi> known to the world as the writers of the Etonian, one of the best books ever written by young men, 
                            . . . their talents . . . of a calibre well adapted for an annual, brisk, painted, and polished". 
                            The reviewer apparently referred to a short-lived school magazine, the <hi rend="italic">Etonian</hi> (1820-21), 
                            which Knight had published, and which strictly applied only to a handful of the 1828 annual's male contributors--the poet 
                            W. M. Praed (1802-39), who founded the Etonian, along with the Reverend John Moultrie (1799-1874). 
                            Perhaps the reviewer meant to characterize the model of friendship that informed the anthology, 
                            although another writer for the Monthly Review wanted to know who Moultrie was, and why the volume contained so many of his poems, "as bad as a dose of opium"

                        <p>If Knight took advantage of his connection with the Etonian "set", the larger roster of contributors suggests 
                            that the editor and proprietors made a substantial investment in order to lure readers with celebrated names--Maria Edgeworth (1769-1849), 
                            Thomas de Quincey (1785-1859), and the poet laureate, Robert Southey (1774-1843) <!--Other contributors to that maiden volume were well known to consumers of annuals,

                            in the Friendship's Offering for 1835 (see "Saltzburg": Discussion). Apparently before this time, Pringle had become a regular dinner guest of the Ruskins at Herne Hill, 
                            though in what year is unknown; the acquaintance may have been struck as early as autumn 1829, the season of Pringle's second volume of Friendship's Offering, 
                            when Ruskin's cousin, <!-- link to bio note -->Charles Richardson, was employed as a shop boy for Smith, Elder 
                            (see also <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php#PERSONALCONNECTIONS">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books: The Annuals and the Ruskin Family</ref>).</p>

                                <p>Pringle was a native Scot like John James Ruskin as well as the publishers of Friendship's Offering, 
                                    George Smith and Alexander Elder. When Pringle took over the editorship of the annual, 
                                    he was recently returned from <placeName corresp="#SOUTHAFRICA">South Africa</placeName>, 
                                    where, with a party of other Scots, he had emigrated in search of opportunities in the Cape Colony, 
                                    which Britain had acquired as a possession in the Congress of Vienna. 
                                    He returned to England with disappointed hopes, but with exotic experience to be made into poetry as well as a passion for the abolitionist cause. 
                                    It was doubtless his earlier literary connections in Edinburgh, however, with figures no less auspicious than Walter Scott, 
                                    <!-- link to bio note -->James Hogg, and others, that made him a welcome guest at Herne Hill.</p>
                                
                                <p>Pringle brought to his first volume of Friendship's Offering a noticeable Caledonian emphasis. 
                                    Under Knight, the annual for 1828 featured a handful of Scottish contributors. 
                                    Under Pringle, the volume for 1829 presented over thirty contributions by Scots--more than a third of the total--including such poems as 
                                    <title type="poem" corresp="GIBSONCORONACH">"The Highland Hunter's Coronach"</title>, <title type="poem" corresp="KENNEDYLEAVINGSCOTLAND">"On Leaving Scotland"</title>, and 
                                    "Auld Joe Nicholson's Bonny Nannie: A Sang"; and such tales as "The Covenanters: A Scottish Traditionary Tale". 
                                    Scottish landscapes are also prominent among the engravings (see 
                                    <ref type="internal" target="#SMITHELDERILLUSTRATI0N">"Made Expressly for the Work": The Art Scene in the <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> Annual</ref>).</p>
                                
                                <p>The Scotch emphasis was given contrasting reception by some reviewers in North Britain and South Britain. 
                                    The Edinburgh Literary Journal proudly highlighted two annuals for 1829--Friendship's Offering 
                                    and the Anniversary--that were "edited by Scotchmen" and showcased Scotch "names . . . shin[ing] most conspicuously in their tables of contents". 
                                    Of the two, the Anniversary stood out most prominently for making "peculiar claims on the people of Scotland". 
                                    Edited by the poet Allan Cunningham, and making its debut that year, the Anniversary presented what the reviewer admitted may be considered 
                                    "an over degree of nationality" by "[o]ur Southern friends" (ANNUALS1829EDINBURGLITJNL "The Annuals for 1829", 5).</p>
                                
                                <p>Some southern journals did object, like La Belle Assembl&#x00E9;e, "that too many of the pieces" 
                                    in Pringle's 1829 Friendship's Offering "derive their origin north of the Tweed", 
                                    as well as presenting "somewhat too large proportion of what may be termed religious matter", which "can seldom be amalgamated successfully with the lighter effusions 
                                    of the <hi rend="italic">Belles Lettres</hi>" (ANNUALS1829BELLEASSEMBLEE &#x201C;The Annuals for 1829&#x201D;, 197). 
                                    Those two objections were connected more straightforwardly and stridently by the Monthly Review, 
                                    which advised the Anniversary to rein in Scotch contributions since "a beautiful work of art" requires that 
                                    "all the parts shall be in unison"; and without "mean[ing] to insinuate any dislike of the true Doric dialect, 
                                    as it has been called, of Scotland", the reviewer urged that "in every instance the current language of England . . . prevail in the literature of the Annuals"

                                    The Monthly Review historically set itself up as a gatekeeper of prescriptive diction and grammar--a 
                                    prescriptiveness that, from the journal's eighteenth-century beginnings, had taken aim especially at Scottish dialect, and all the more keenly so if the reviewer was himself a Scot 
                                    (Percy, "Periodical Reviews and the Rise of Prescriptivism"). The journal was also known for a longstanding prejudice against religious "enthusiasm", 
                                    an animus that, in the eighteenth century, was directed against Methodism (McInelly, "When Worlds Collide"). 
                                    In 1829, the Monthly Review linked what it perceived as linguistic and religious parochialism in the Anniversary, singling out a contribution 
                                    by the Church of Scotland clergyman, Edward Irving (1792-1834), which the reviewer characterized as given to a 
                                    "'puritanic . . . phraseology, which literary persons belonging to that sect are too much in the habit of using on all occasions". 
                                    In contrast, as an example of "neatly written essays on popular subjects", reviewer quoted at length from another piece in the volume 
                                    "on the Female Beauty of the Three Kingdoms", which discovers ecumenically that female beauty is independent of nation, being found wherever 
                                    "gentleness of . . . [woman's] nature and the kindliness of her heart throw a household halo around her person"

                                <p>Editors of annuals faced risks in presenting any perceivable excess that reviewers might argue as deranging the aesthetic 
                                    that the Monthly's reviewer characterized as a "beautiful . . . unison". At the same time, reviewers complained routinely 
                                    about the overall blandness and uniformity of the annuals, especially as the market grew increasingly competitive with new titles added each year (see the

                                    Cunningham, or his publisher, ceased publication of the Anniversary in the midst of compiling only its second volume (Cunningham's 
                                    biographer blamed the publisher's unsettled plans [Hogg, Life of Allan Cunningham, 332]), but Pringle survived criticism 
                                    of the lopsided Scottish contributions to Friendship's Offering. While he earned credit as "one of Scotland's true tuneful sons" from 
                                    Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine because, the reviewer admitted, the Scottish emphasis in Friendship's Offering (for 1830) brought out, "of all our critical qualities, 
                                    nationality . . . [as] the chief" (MONOLOGUEONANNUALS "Monologue", 967), Pringle himself claimed in his preface to the annual (for 1829) 
                                    to have "promote[d] . . . a sound and liberal national taste"--meaning a British nationalism. In practice, that policy meant offsetting 
                                    the many pieces about Scotland with an "Irish Tale", "A German Legend", a tale of "an old Frenchman of the time of Louis XIV", 
                                    and--in a broadly unifying spirit--an "Ode on the Death of Queen Charlotte" by Southey, the English poet laureate. 
                                    George III's queen had been dead for a decade, but she remained sound currency in the same spirit with which the Monthly Review admired the Anniversary's essay 
                                    on the universality of female virtues: all "future Queens [shall] to her / As to their best exemplar look", the poet predicted, 
                                    since, thanks to Charlotte, "At Court, the Household Virtues had their place"

                <p>The pictorial "embellishments" of the annuals were as significant as their literary content, if not more so. As the Monthly Review remarked, 
                                critical scrutiny of the annuals was justified by their literary content, which, although "fugitive and trifling . . . in some instances", was worth 
                                "the attention of a journal which professes to watch the intellect of the country"; however, it was the annuals' pictorial content that 
                                placed the annuals in "a class by themselves, which enables us to judge . . . of the progress made amongst us, not only in literary composition, but in the arts" 
                                (REVIEWANNUALS1829MONTHLY Unsigned review of <hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi> [1829], <hi rend="italic">The Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi> [1829], <hi rend="italic">The Gem</hi> [1829], <hi rend="italic">The Literary Souvenir</hi> [1829], and <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi> [1829], 377-78; and see

                <p>In Friendship's Offering, from Relfe's volumes to Smith, Elder's, the number of "embellishments" per volume remained twelve or thirteen, including the frontispiece and presentation plate, 
                            which form part of the frontmatter. (A <hi rend="italic">presentation plate</hi> is an engraved title page with a blank cartouche, in which the giver or owner could 
                                inscribe a name or brief message.) Although some annuals competed by offering more embellishments, a dozen or so was typical of other annuals besides Friendship's Offering, 
                                presumably because the number of plates was limited not only by the expense of commissioning artists and engravers but also by the availability of space between text signatures for insertion of plates. 
                            While the number of plates remained steady over the life of Friendship's Offering, some differing phases can be detected in approaches to the Sister Arts, 
                            and in tastes of the times and editors. (The following account remains in process.)</p>

                                <p>Relfe's 1826 volume is instructive in its pairings of picture and poem, 
                                    which reflect the English Romantic-era transformation of the <hi rend="italic">ut pictura poesis</hi> aesthetic, 
                                    when the worn pictorialism of the eighteenth century was abandoned 
                                    in favor of a view of the Sister Arts as "twin facets of a unified poetic experience" 
                                    (Park, "'Ut Pictura Poesis': The Nineteenth-Century Aftermath", 156). 
                                    A shared poetic experience is testified by ekphrastic poems in volume 26, 
                                    as in a poem accompanying a Claude's 
                                    Landscape with the Marriage of Isaac and Rebecca (1648, 
                                    acquired for the National Gallery in 1824, as part of the Angerstein Collection). 
                                    The speaker declines to engage in rivalry with the painter--the contest of the Renaissance paragone--instead proffering a shared poetic language: 
                                    "I feel / No envy of thy noble art, / . . . which, unto outward sense, / Speaks in a language so refined"

                                    for a response unifying the Sister Arts by the poet, L.E.L: 
                                    despite the "face of death" imprinted on the figure of Raphael, which is "paler and colder than the marble bust", 
                                    the poet looks to the artist's "soul", which remains undiminished, "leav[ing] its influence on the heart!" 
                                    (L.E.L., "Raphael's Death-Bed",

                                    The shared poetic emotion plays into the memorializing that is stock-in-trade of the literary and artistic annual </p>
                                
                                <p>The unifying poetic emotion  of the Sister Arts was especially associated with the artist commissioned for the frontispiece, 
                                    Richard Westall (1765-1836), known for his illustrations of Romantic-era poetry 
                                    and his evocative portraits of Byron. As an 1824 tribute to Westall effused, 
                                    he was an ideal portraitist of Byron since "Thou saw'st the poet, with a poet's eye, / 
                                    And hence a poet's mind could well descry, / For thou, to graphic genius not confin'd, / Can'st boast the pow'rs of a poetic mind" 
                                    (John Taylor [1757-1832], "Lines on the Portrait of the Late Lord Byron, Painted by Richard Westall, Esq. RA", 
                                    quoted in Westall, "Richard Westall's Labours of Love", 60). 
                                    In this case, the artist's poetic reputation perhaps counted for more with readers than the intrinsic merit of his illustrations, which were feeble for this volume.</p>

                                <p>Besides participating in the "poetic" discourse of the Sister Arts that was typical of the period, 
                                    volume 26 also reflects the division at the time between British and French aesthetics. 
                                    While the influence of this debate over the annual's commissions may have been adventitious, 
                                    a signal outcome was the valume's beautiful final plate,

                                    by Richard Parkes Bonington (1802-28) 
                                    (see Noon, Richard Parkes Bonington: The Complete Paintings, 121 [no. 57]). 
                                    The son of an &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9; British artist living in France, Bonington received his training in the atelier 
                                    of Baron Antoine-Jean Gros (1771-1835). To a neoclassicist such as Gros and the influential artist and critic &#x00C9;tienne Del&#x00E9;cluze (1781-1863), 
                                    the coastal scenery of Normandy and the Gothic architecture of Rouen, which possessed a special attraction for Bonington, 
                                    seemed random and meaningless when scaled against the traditional ordering of the Sister Arts, 
                                    which elevated historical and religious subjects above classical landscape--much less above the local, provincial scenes that attracted British artists. 
                                    Yet, to the alarm of those who defended the tradition of Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825), these picturesque subjects then growing in popularity also in France. 
                                    French critics also associated the picturesque with the loose style of British artists, 
                                    such as the textured brushstrokes of John Constable's landscapes and the broken lines <!-- link to note -->Samuel Prout's architectural drawing. 
                                    (Prout likewise sketched in Normandy.) 
                                    The seeming disregard for finish by British painters violated the priority that neoclassicism awarded to disegno, 
                                    the conceptual emphasis on design, line, and form 
                                    (Noon, Richard Parkes Bonington: The Complete Paintings, 14-18).</p>
                                
                                <p>Nonetheless, English style had recently gained impetus in France from the success of Constable, Copley Fielding, and other British painters 
                                    at the Paris Salon of 1824. Fired by enthusiasm for British landscape art and for the naturalistic approach it represented, 
                                    Bonington visited London in 1825, in the company of Alexandre-Marie Colin (1798-1875), 
                                    Eug&#x00E8;ne Delacroix (1798-1863), and other young French artists in the vanguard of French Romanticism. 
                                    As contacts in London, Bonington relied on engravers, including the <!--link to note-->Cooke family, known for their reproduction of work by J. M. W. Turner 
                                    (Noon, Richard Parkes Bonington: The Complete Paintings, 34-35).  
                                    It was a younger member of that family, William John Cooke (1796-1865), 
                                    who was responsible for engraving Bonington's Rouen on steel--the technology that made mass production of pictures in the annuals practicable. 
                                    Cooke brought state-of-the-art skill to the commission, 
                                    earning a medal in 1826 for his improvements in etching steel 
                                    (Hunnisett, Steel-engraved Book Illustration in England, 48-49; Munday, Edward William Cooke, 37-38).</p>
                                
                                <p>Figure compositions by French artists in volume 26 likewise reflected the current tensions between neoclassicism and Romanticism. 
                                    In two plates based on paintings by Horace Vernet (1789-1863), 
                                    The Dog of the Regiment and The Dead Trumpeter, 
                                    battlefield scenes combine with genre, featuring the loyalty of domestic animals amid the carnage of war. 
                                    In poems paired with the scenes, T. K. Hervey constructs memories of home for the animals' fallen masters. 
                                    For Del&#x00E9;cluze, Vernet's Salon pictures, on which engravings like these were based, represented a confusion of genre and history painting, 
                                    which threatened the conceptual basis of grande peinture (Doyle, "Bad Manners vs. Good <hi rend="italic">Maniera</hi>", 140). 
                                    Worse, Vernet disseminated a taste for such mixed subjects by embracing contemporary forms of art reproduction, 
                                    such as lithography and aquatint, which challenged the authority given to line engraving by the French Academy 
                                    (Bann, "Horace Vernet and Paul Delaroche", 230-31; and on the broader context of these debates see

                                <p>Overall, volume 26 of Friendship's Offering would have been regarded by a traditionalist French critic as representative 
                                    of how the commercialization of art through book illustration, and through such popular spectacles as the diorama, 
                                    threatened a degeneration of the ideology propping up the traditional ordering of the arts.  
                                    Even the volume's single example of Davidian neoclassicism, Aeneas Tells Dido the Misfortunes of the City of Troy, originated with 
                                    Pierre-Narcisse Gu&#x00E9;rin (1774-1833), Vernet's friend and predecessor 
                                    as director of the Acad&#x00E9;mie de France &#x00E0; Rome. 
                                    The English writer for the Monthly Review considered Gu&#x00E9;rin's Aeneas "cold and stiff", 
                                    but singled out Vernet's genre vignettes as "really . . . beautiful little piece[s]", 
                                    which did "great credit" to the engraver, Edward Finden, 
                                    as did the "clever" plate of Rouen by Cooke

                                    <persName corresp="#LHUXLEY">Leonard Huxley</persName>, art reproduction was the special care of <persName corresp="#AE">Alexander Elder</persName> (<date notBefore="1790" notAfter="1876">1790&#x2013;1876</date>), who was interested in art

                                    Presumably, Elder would have been anxious to showcase the firm's expertise in their selection and presentation of the new annual's embellishments. 
                                    The firm would also have needed to extend their expertise beyond engraving and aquatint to commission steel engraving (see 
                                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php#STEELENGRAVING">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books: Steel Engraving</ref>).</p>
                            
                            <p>As one shift in emphasis from the annual's beginnings, it appears that, whereas Relfe inclined to an ut pictura poesis aesthetic centered on Old Masters and modern history painting, 
                                Smith, Elder advertised that their debut volume would feature engravings taken from recently exhibited British paintings, 
                                including art "painted expressly for the Work".  
                                If Smith, Elder decided strategically to feature pictures from recent London exhibitions, 
                                the choice shifted away from Relfe's reliance on the intrinsic prestige of history painting, much of it by French artists, 
                                to seek popular favor and institutional support at home. For consumers like the Ruskins, studying the plates and their accompanying ekphrastic poems and essays 
                                raised their awareness of London exhibiting institutions and poetic tropes for response.</p>

                                The artist was a history painter, John Wood (1801-70), who had recently gained recognition at the Royal Academy for such works as

                                In the following volume, for 1829, Wood created a frontispiece "expressly for this work",

                            <p>For 1829, while Wood's frontispiece maintains the feature of contemporary English historical painting, other embellishments reflect the Scottish emphasis 
                                that Pringle summmoned in the literary contributions (see <ref type="internal" target="#PRINGLE">The Pringle Editorship</ref>). 
                                The plates pivot away from figure art to landscape, introduced early and prominently with 
                                <title type="artwork" corresp="#MARTINGLENLYNDEN"><hi rend="italic">Glen-Lynden</hi></title>, 
                                a "landscape with ruins, designed and engraved for this work by John Martin". 
                                In 1829, Martin (1789-1854) stood at the height of his fame for his panoramic paintings of apocalyptic biblical events; 
                                and since 1826, he had been producing from his own studio the large mezzotints on steel that extended the audience for his popular paintings, such as the prints 
                                Joshua Commanding the Sun to Stand Still (1827; painting first exhibited 1816); 
                                and The Deluge (1828; painting first exhibited 1826). 
                                At the same time, Martin was designing and producing small mezzotints for the annuals, 
                                publishing over twenty plates between 1826 and 1837 in the Amulet, the Literary Souvenir, and other annuals. 
                                Among the earliest of these small prints was <title type="artwork" corresp="#MARTINGLENLYNDEN"><hi rend="italic">Glen-Lynden</hi></title> 
                                for Friendship's Offering (Wees, "Darkness Visible", 3, 29-30, 33 [cat. no. 24]).</p>

                                overwhelms its homely pairing, the poem "Glen-Lynden: A Tale of Teviotdale" by the volume editor, 
                                whose persona humbles himself as the "last and lowliest of the train" of poets to pay "pious tribute" to "haunted Teviot", "the loved mother he has left behind". 
                                Pringle preferred the traditional name <hi rend="italic">Teviotdale</hi> for the valley of the Teviot River near Kelso in Roxburghshire, where he was born. 
                                The name <hi rend="italic">Glen Lynden</hi>, although used here for a fictional Border glen, was in real life the name Pringle bestowed on the settlement in Cape Colony. 
                                (Vigne, Thomas Pringle, 79). In the posthumous edition of Pringle's poems, "Glen-Lynden" would be re-presented as a fragment of "The Emigrants" intended to incorporate 
                                a fictionalized account of the immigration to South Africa. Standing alone, "Glen Lynden" could "call to mind / The scenes that Scottish hearts to their dear country bind" 
                                even for those in "foreign lands" only as far as England like the Ruskins

                                <p>As if designed as a melancholy reminder specifically for the Ruskin family, the theme of Scottish landscape with ruins 
                                    continues in volume 29 with Campbell Castle, 
                                drawn by George Arnald (1763-1841) and supported by a poem by David Macbeth Moir ("Delta", 1798-1851)

                                The castle is located in the Ochil Hills, which the Ruskins passed through in their journeys north to visit the family of 
                                John James's sister, Jessie Richardson, in Perth--journeys now curtailed by the deaths of Jessie and two of her children in 1826-28.

                            <p>however, the frontmatter seems designed to assure continuity with the genre of the literary album, highlighting the same Romantic-era adaptation of <hi rend="italic">ut pictura poesis</hi> 
                            as found in Relfe's volume 26. A dedicatory poem presents a female recipient, the "Lady of the Book", 
                            with this "album" as a "fair enclosure" uniting the sister arts in "quintessence of Po&#x00EB;sy" 
                            (James Montgomery, "The First Leaf of an Album"). The frontispiece, "painted . . . expressly for this work", is a classical subject, 
                            , just as volume 26 had gravitated to Old Masters. 
                            The artist, "J. Wood", was probably the history painter . This gateway to the volume's sister-arts experience appears consistent with Smith, Elder's debut volume, for 1828, 
                            which opened with "A Sylph <title type="periodical" corresp="#MIRROROFLITERATURE"><hi rend="italic">The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction</hi></title>

                                The calf binding was blind-embossed on the full surface of both front and back covers with an arabesque design,

                        and some of the contributions to the &#x2018;annuals&#x2019; entitle them to a higher stand&#x201D;
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SPIRITOFTHEANNUALS"><title type="periodical" corresp="#MIRROROFLITERATURE">&#x201C;Spirit of &#x2018;The Annuals&#x2019; for 1828&#x201D;</title></ref>, 418). 
                        By the &#x201C;original plan&#x201D;, the writer refers apparently to the binding used by <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>, 
                        which consisted of glazed paper boards, printed with a decorative and typographic cover, in imitation of the binding used for the <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> 
                        (the latter already moving to silk; see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title></ref>, 133).

                    <p>The annuals dueled to be judged by their covers, the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> having set an initial standard with its printed and glazed paper boards, 
                        cloth spine, and slipcase, later replaced by a silk cover 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN"><persName corresp="#JFORD">Ford</persName>, <title type="biography" corresp="#FORDACKERMAN"><hi rend="italic">Ackermann</hi></title></ref>, 65).  
                        Innovation and extravagance&#x2014;or at least the appearance of extravagance&#x2014;in bindings and engraved or lithographed front matter became characteristic of annuals, 
                        which used this immediate source of appeal to compete in a crowded market 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FAXONLITERARYANNUALS">Faxon, <title type="bibliography" corresp="FAXONLITERARYANNUALS"><hi rend="italic">Literary Annuals</hi></title></ref>, xiv&#x2013;xvi). 
                        Mechanization brought these material appeals within reach of the ordinary consumer; and mass&#x2010;produced fancy bindings in particular 
                        shifted traditional division of labor, since publishers took on the economic burden of bookbinding, which conventionally had been borne by the consumer.
                        <persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName> also speculates that the annuals&#x02BC; elaborately embossed leather covers suggested the bindings of prayer books and bibles&#x2014;the only other expensively 
                        bound stock that retailers typically offered over the counter (as opposed to cheap temporary bindings, to be replaced by the consumer). 
                        These &#x201C;gospel&#x2010;like bindings&#x201D; may have been meant &#x201C;to convince the reading public of the wholesome value of the literature and engravings within&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title></ref>, 131, 133&#x2013;34). 
                        Perhaps the comment in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#MIRROROFLITERATURE"><hi rend="italic">Mirror of Literature</hi></title> that the sturdier cover 
                        of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> matched its more substantial content inside, capable of subsisting beyond the lady&#x02BC;s boudoir, 
                        gestured at an audience that expanded to include, not just male readers, but the entire family gathered in the parlor.</p>
                        
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <p><orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> benefited by these early, rapid developments in the annual as a commodity. 
                        Its binding was more sumptuous, and the engraving sharper and more consistent. To mark these improvements, <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> expanded the subtitle, 
                        from <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="RELFEFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering: A Literary Album</hi></title> to 
                        <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering: A Literary Album and Annual Remembrancer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A Literary Album, and Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present</hi>.  
                        In <date when="1833">1833</date>, the title changed again, the annual having absorbed another existing publication, <hi rend="italic">Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi>, 
                        which had been published in <placeName corresp="#LIVERPOOL">Liverpool</placeName> since <date when="1828">1828</date>. This merger resulted in the title, 
                        <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi> (so the title appears on the typeset title page; 
                        for a time, the engraved frontispiece with the earlier title remained in production). 
                        This latest title was in use when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first appeared in the annual, in the issue, 
                        <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath: A Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present for <hi rend="smallcaps">MDCCCXXXV</hi></hi></title>.

                    <p>At the same time, a comparison of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s product with the volumes published by the annual&#x02BC;s creator, <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>, 
                        suggests that the new firm attempted to keep the interior uniform with earlier volumes, at least initially. 
                        As remarked about the 1826 volume edited by Hervey for Relfe, the annual was already responsive to the "poetic" sensibility that unified the sister arts during that period. . . </p>
