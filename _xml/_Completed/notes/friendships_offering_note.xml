                                Relfe's preface seems bent on covering all bases for the possible marketability of his attempt at this miscellaneous venue--to compete with Continental models (chiefly German) 
                                of the literary annual by translating the form to meet British taste; to supply the holiday gift market; to furnish ("independently") both "graphic decorations" and "original contributions . . . from popular pens"; 
                                to "partially . . . supply" the features of a pocket-book, thus incorporating yet "elevat[ing]" the function of this annual diary or "remembrancer"; 
                                and a purpose not mentioned directly by the competitors, to seize on the British pent-up, post-Napoleonic desire for travel, actual or virtual, by pairing engraved "views" of foreign cities with descriptions based on "personal observation" 
                                (see the preface to <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1824"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> for <date when="1824">1824</date>, 
                                reprinted in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title></ref>, 124&#x2013;25;

                            <p>In an <date when="1858">1858</date> article in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#BOOKSELLER"><hi rend="italic">Bookseller</hi></title>, 
                                attempting an appreciative critical history of the annuals when they had declined in popularity, <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>&#x02BC;s early volumes 
                                were criticized for their weak contents and poor production and also their haphazard miscellaneity--&#x201C;unpromising&#x201D; assemblages of &#x201C;indifferent views of Continental cities&#x201D;, &#x201C;poor verses&#x201D;, 
                                and the occasional &#x201C;tale by <persName corresp="#AO">Mrs. Opie</persName>&#x201D; (i.e., <persName corresp="#AO">Amelia Opie</persName> [<date notBefore="1769" notAfter="1853">1769&#x2013;1853</date>]). 
                                The writer particularly dwelled on the inclusion of &#x201C;ruled pages for memoranda&#x201D;, as typically found in a pocket-book, as the proof of unconsidered paste-up, 
                                a feature that the writer condemned likewise in the Offering's early rivals, Forget Me Not and The Graces
                                (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ANNUALSOFFORMERDAYS"><title type="annual" corresp="#ANNUALSOFFORMERDAYS">&#x201C;The Annuals of Former Days&#x201D;</title></ref>, 495-96). 
                                In the 1820s, however, reviews of <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName>&#x02BC;s early volumes suggest that critics embraced the miscellany. 
                                The Gentleman's Magazine, reviewing the Friendship's Offering for 1825, explained that "the aim of the editor . . . appears to have been to combine the elegance of art 
                                and flowers of literature with the utility of the superior class of pocket-books, and in this . . .  he has in a great degree succeeded"--adding parenthetically, not that Relfe should have aimed at greater uniformity of purpose, 
                                but that he might have made up for "the deficiency of an almanack", although admittedly that addition "would have necessarily much increased the price" 
                                (REVIEWFO1825GENTLEMANS Unsigned review of Friendship's Offering for 1825, 445). In the view of the Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction, Relfe's second volume of Friendship's Offering (1825) 
                                had "much improved since last year" since it offered more, not less, variety of contents: "nearly three hundred pages of interesting articles in prose and verse; 
                                a Diary, with views at the head of each month [i.e., what the Gentleman's Magazine described as "a blank Diary for memoranda, headed by 12 very neat wood engravings of ancient castles, churches, &#x0026;c., all in the county of Kent"], 
                                and fourteen copper plate engravings, including four sweet views of the cities of St. Petersburgh, Constantinople, Berne, and Naples"; 
                                and rounding out the "literary department", "some original music, and several enigmas, riddles, and rebuses" 
                                (CHRISTMASPRESENTSMIRROROFLIT "Christmas and New Years' Presents", 409). In its next volume, the Mirror reprinted some of the riddles and songs ("Riddles and Conundrums"; "Discretion the Better Part of Valour").</p>
                            <p>According to the 1858 Bookseller article, the fortunes of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> were turned around by 
                                by the editorship of <persName corresp="#TKH">T. K. Hervey</persName> (<date notBefore="1799" notAfter="1859">1799&#x2013;1859</date>). In his prefatory remarks for <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1826">1826</date> volume, <persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName> announced &#x201C;a view to an entire change in . . . [the annual&#x02BC;s] character and plan&#x201D;, 
                                by shifting emphasis from the transience of an annual to the permanence of a keepsake: the &#x201C;alterations&#x201D; were to &#x201C;consist in the removal of all those features which marked it as more peculiarly adapted for one season of the year than another&#x201D;. 
                                Starting with that volume, the almanack and pocket-book features were suppressed, and the subtitle shortened to "A Literary Album" to signal the concentrated focus. 
                                What had happened was not solely Hervey's inspiration, however, but a broader trend reflected in a <title type="periodical" corresp="#MONTHLYREVIEW"><hi rend="italic">Monthly Review</hi></title> article 
                                published one year earlier, which is clearly the source of Hervey's announcement of changes being made in Friendship's Offering. The article presents a brief critical history of the British annual, 
                                celebrating the "keen and enterprising spirit of emulation" that has enabled "our countrymen" in a short time to have so improved on the German Taschenbuch that "the least elegant of . . . [the British annuals] is greatly superior to any thing produced on the Continent". 
                                The key to this progress, according to the article, lay in a marker that carried a rebuke to the proprietor of Frienship's Offering:</p>

                            <p>Since Hervey quotes the phrase in italics nearly verbatim, it is evident that this review had determined Relfe to rescue Friendship's Offering from among the "few minor productions" 
                                that formed the "exception" to this brilliant tale of British progress. In 1825, probably only one annual represented the pinnacle of achievement--the Literary Souvenir, 
                                edited by Alaric Watts, the sole publication under review in this Monthly Review article. Although only first published in 1825, the Literary Souvenir already benefitted 
                                from a nationalistic evolutionary narrative. (The narrative gained credence from the decision of the Souvenir's publisher, Hurst, Robinson, to make way for funding the Literary Souvenir 
                                by discontinuing an existing annual, The Graces, after publishing only one volume. Although the exchange was friendly, The Graces, which was born the same year as Friendship's Offering, 
                                ironically contributed to the evolutionary narrative by claiming British superiority over Continental models for having disburdened itself of the their "loaded . . . weight" of almanack features, 
                                but then set itself "to embrace . . . every topic of accomplishment, elegance, and polite information, that can interest the general reader", 
                                including a decorated diary for the user's memoranda, which it imitated from Forget Me Not

                                &#x201C;a sort of Court Calendar&#x201D; of one&#x02BC;s own, as <persName corresp="#JHLH">Hunt</persName> put it (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LODGEROMANTICRELIQUARIES"><persName corresp="#SLODGE">Lodge</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#LODGEROMANTICRELIQUARIES">&#x201C;Romantic Reliquaries&#x201D;</title></ref>, 25). Nonetheless, <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName> seems initially to have had trouble positioning his annual to respond to the conflicting audience demands of the transitional, post&#x2010;Waterloo period. 
                                Externally, the cover and slipcase of the <date when="1825">1825</date> volume have been found to be unexpectedly splendid, as proved by a well-preserved copy acquired by

                                In a review of the annuals for 1827, a writer for the London Magazine, who despaired of the annuals ever amassing a pool of genuine talent, 
                                proposed a model based on "the Taschenbuchs of Germany, which were sometimes got up by a few men of genius, who, 
                                at the end of the year, clubbed their <hi rend="italic">adversaria</hi>, and published together a little miscellaneous volume, 
                                which had or might not have some definite object. The hint might, we think, be adopted in this country with advantage". 
                                Alhough "the time is gone by when men wrote in knots and schools", the writer considering even the Lake School a thing of the past in 1826, 
                                he believed "[t]here are . . . many clubs or schools even at present existing, which might throw together an occasional periodical of this kind with effect, 
                                whether the object be grave or gay--pleasure or improvement". The echoes of this proposal with Knight's experience of publishing the Etonian are striking 
                                ("Souvenir Books, or Joint-Stock Literature" [unsigned review of Forget Me Not (1827) and Friendship's Offering (1827)], 480).</p>

                                    the annuals were directed at &#x201C;the emotions and associations aroused in the heart and mind of the beholder&#x201d;

                                    Reviewers might complain about the overall blandness and uniformity of the annuals, especially as the market grew increasingly competitive with new titles added each year, but at the same time the market tended toward uniformity. 
                                    For whatever reason, <persName corresp="#ACUNNINGHAM">Cunningham</persName>, or his publisher, ceased publication of the <title type="annual" corresp="#ANNIVERSARY"><hi rend="italic">Anniversary</hi></title> in the midst of compiling only its second volume.

                <p>The pictorial &#x201C;embellishments&#x201D; of the annuals were as significant as their literary content, if not more so. As a species of visual culture, the annuals inspired national pride.

                    It was the annuals&#x02BC; pictorial content, however, that placed the annuals in &#x201C;a class by themselves, which enables us to judge . . . of the progress made amongst us, not only in literary composition, but in the arts&#x201D;

                            which form part of the frontmatter. (A <hi rend="italic">presentation plate</hi> is an engraved title page with a blank cartouche, in which the giver or owner could 
                    inscribe a name or brief message.) Although some annuals competed by offering more embellishments, a dozen or so was likewise typical of other annuals, 
                    the number perhaps limited by the time and expense required to commission or borrow art, and arrange for the lengthy process of steel reproduction&#x2014;processes that must have grown more competitive as new titles entered the market each year. 
                    <!-- NEW TAGGING -->As Alaric Watts pointed out to consumers of the Literary Souvenir, "if, instead of such illustrations as these [ten in number, assembled for the 1826 volume], from original paintings and drawings, most of which have been procured with very great expense, 
                    I had chosen to introduce inferior plates, perhaps pleasing enough to persons possessing no great refinement of taste, taken from published prints, or obtained from cheap sources, 
                    more than double the number might have been given, at precisely the same cost". However, in order to keep the price at the competitive twelve shillings per copy, he was obliged to balance the costs of original artwork 
                    and engraving against the large-volume sales required to make a profit (Watts, preface to Literary Souvenir [1826], viii). 
                    According to one estimate of costs entailed in producing all the annuals for 1829, the total expenditures on commissions and fees to artists and engravers more than doubled the payments to writers, 
                    despite the disparity in numbers of contributions--in any given annual, perhaps nearly a hundred pieces of writing compared to a dozen plates (see Onslow, "Gendered Production: Annuals and Gift Books", 74).<!-- END NEW TAGGING --></p>
                <p>The number of plates contained in a given volume does not appear to have been constrained by practical considerations of binding, such as limiting insertion to the gaps between signatures. 
                    Placement was governed by content: a plate could be inserted facing the first page of a poem describing it, or adjacent to a page in the middle of a tale that contained a climactic event depicted in the engraving

                    <p>In its approach to the Sister Arts, Friendship's Offering reflects the English Romantic&#x2010;era transformation of the <hi rend="italic">ut pictura poesis</hi> aesthetic, 
                        whereby poetry and picture are treated as &#x201C;twin facets of a unified poetic experience&#x201D;

                        Eighteenth-century pictorialism might recur in some poems and in tales, picking out details in their accompanying plates as a strategy for binding the picture to a descriptive poem or a tale's action

                        but more typical is the keynote of pervasive emotion struck by the opening poem of Smith, Elder's 1829 volume: "Two lovely Sisters here unite" so that 
                        "Here may each glowing Picture be / The quintessence of Po&#x00EB;sy", and "the Poet's verse, alike", may "With all the Power of Painting strike"--both 
                        picture and poen deriving from and appealing to "the bosom's inmost cell" where "colours" can be "pure thought", and the "image-chamber of the heart" where "fresh scenes and shapes" can be formed from "silent words" 
                        (James Montgomery, "The First Leaf of an Album", in

                    <p>The Romantic formula for the "poetry" of the Sister Arts could be viewed as generating mere "common-places" in the annuals, as the Monthly Review remarked about

                        The speaker declines to engage in rivalry with the painter&#x2014;that is, the Renaissance <hi rend="italic">paragone</hi>, which put the competing descriptive powers of writer and painter at odds, instead of unified in their "poetry". 
                        Instead, the poem instead proffers a shared poetic language: &#x201C;I feel / No envy of thy noble art, / . . . which, unto outward sense, / Speaks in a language so refined&#x201D;. 
                        The poem is formulaic because it has nothing to say about the emotions suggested by Claude's landscape in itself

                    <p>At the same time, the emotional response deemed appropriate to the audience of the annuals' Sister Arts--the "Lady of the Book", 
                        as she is named in Montgomery's "The First Leaf of an Album"--was believed to be best kept small and familiar, if not commonplace. 
                        The Monthly Review considered a French classical landscape an inappropriate choice for an annual: "<hi rend="italic">A <persName corresp="#CLAUDE">Claude</persName></hi>;

                    <p>This expectation for modesty of emotion had the effect of leveling the traditional ordering of the arts. There is a conflict between the original status and the reduced accessibility in Friendship's Offering 
                        of a modern history painting, which was engraved for volume 26, <title type="artwork" corresp="BERGERETRAPHAELONHISDEATHBED"><hi rend="italic">Honors Rendered to Raphael on his Deathbed</hi></title> (<date when="1806">1806</date>), 
                        by the French painter, <persName corresp="#PNB">Pierre Nolasque Bergeret</persName> (<date notBefore="1782" notAfter="1863">1782&#x2013;1863</date>). 
                        The death of <persName corresp="#RSU">Raphael</persName> is rendered as described by Vasari, his body surrounded by prominent churchmen, courtiers, and artists, 
                        and "placed at the upper end of the hall wherein he had last worked, with the picture of the Transfiguration, 
                        which he had executed for Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, at the head of the corpse" 
                        (Vasari, Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, trans. Foster, 3:61). The subject was germane to an ekphrastic miscellany like an annual, 
                        since Raphael had come to regarded as embodying the art of painting itself. For the French academic artworld, however, Raphael stood for the art of painting as a 
                        "symbolic embodiment of French artistic ideals". He was a "'modern Apelles'" answering to "that complete perfection" of art 
                        believed to be "shown in ancient times by the figures of Apelles and Zeuxis". No less was said of Raphael in Britain's Royal Academy, 
                        but durihg the French Empire, when Napoleon had confiscated Raphael's Transfiguration from the Vatican, 
                        the Raphaelesque aesthetic ideal also became politicized. Bergeret's depiction of Raphael's wake, attended by powerful nobles as Vasari recounted, 
                        was meant to illustrate the premise that great men are glorified by their homage to great artists. If Raphael embodied the art of painting, 
                        Napoleon would be its possessor (Rosenberg, "Raphael's Transfiguration and Napoleon's Cultural Politics", 188, 186, 193, 198).</p>
                    <p>In Friendship's Offering, the poem for Bergeret's picture, which was contributed by <persName corresp="#LEL">L.E.L.</persName>, both confirms Raphael's elevated stature 
                        and brings it down to size for the annual. Raphael's art is characterized as deathless, not because of the codependency of art with the power of the state, 
                        but because of the shared poetic emotion that appeals to the ordinary heart. 
                        The prone figure of <persName corresp="#RSU">Raphael</persName> is turned with the &#x201C;face of death&#x201D; to the viewer,

                        but by art &#x201C;leave[ing] its influence on the heart!&#x201D;, giving "Hope to the trembling--mercy to the weak"

                        The Monthly Review treated Berjeret's picture similarly to Claude's landscape, as out of scale for the annual, finding the engraving "sadly overwrought with figures, 
                        and confused in its details", but the reviewer was receptive to the "respectable lines from the pen of Miss Landon"

                    <p>Perhaps because genre subjects and topographical landscape were deemed more accessible to the poetic response expected of the annual's reader, 
                        Friendship's Offering in <date when="1826">1826</date> reflected the current tension between British and French aesthetics, the latter still favoring history painting and classical landscape.<!-- END TAGGING --> 
                        The influence of this debate over the annual&#x02BC;s art commissions may have been somewhat adventitious, but an outcome was the valume&#x02BC;s beautiful final plate,

                    <p>Apparently the first work by this important artist to be published in a British annual, <title type="artwork" corresp="#BONINGTONROUENFROMBONSECOURS"><hi rend="italic">Rouen</hi></title> not only represents the advocacy of British picturesque style by rebellious Romantic French artists;

                        which, like <persName corresp="#RPB">Bonington</persName>&#x02BC;s view of the <placeName corresp="#SEINE">Seine</placeName>, pictured a river prospect from a high vantage. 
                        The two pictures thus put on view the rivalry between the annuals, as well as reflecting the broader aspirations of the young French Romantic artists who, at just this time, 
                        were visiting <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> to study the modern British landscape school.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#RPB">R. P. Bonington</persName>, the son of an &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9; British artist from <placeName corresp="#NOTTINGHAM">Nottingham</placeName> living in <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>,

                        To a neoclassicist such as <persName corresp="#AJG">Gros</persName> and the influential artist and critic <persName corresp="#EDELECLUZE">&#x00C9;tienne Del&#x00E9;cluze</persName> (<date notBefore="1781" notAfter="1863">1781&#x2013;1863</date>), 
                        subjects that especially attracted <persName corresp="#RPB">Bonington</persName>&#x2014;such as the coastal scenery of <placeName corresp="#NORMANDY">Normandy</placeName> 
                        and the Gothic architecture of <placeName corresp="#ROUEN">Rouen</placeName>&#x2014;seemed random and meaningless, low on the scale of the traditional ordering of the Sister Arts. 
                        Students&#x02BC; understanding should be elevated by historical and religious subjects rather than by landscape&#x2014;much less by the localized, provincial scenes 
                        that characterized the British school, as opposed to the timeless classical landscapes of the French tradition. Yet, to the alarm of those who defended 
                        the tradition of <persName corresp="#AJG">Gros</persName>&#x02BC;s teacher, <persName corresp="#JLD">Jacques&#x2010;Louis David</persName> (<date notBefore="1748" notAfter="1825">1748&#x2013;1825</date>), 
                        British&#x2010;influenced picturesque subjects were gaining popularity in <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>. French critics also rejected the loose style of the British school, 
                        such as the textured brushstrokes of oils by <persName corresp="#CONSTABLEARTIST">John Constable</persName>, and the tonal rather than linear definition of architectural drawing

                    <p>Nonetheless, English style had recently gained impetus in <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> from the success of <persName corresp="#CONSTABLEARTIST">John Constable</persName>,

                        Fired by enthusiasm for British landscape art and for the naturalistic approach it represented, <persName corresp="#RPB">Bonington</persName> visited <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>

<!-- NEW TAGGING --><p>Ironically, as presented in the two annuals, the French&#x2010;English affiliations behind <persName corresp="#RPB">Bonington</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s river scenes are turned into rivalries. 
                        Both poems composed respectively for the plates rely on Wordsworthian tropes of return and loss to prompt wistful responses to the scenes; however, the speaker of 
                        "Written at Rouen" is compelled to draw attention to the foreignness of the scene, while the speaker of "Richmond-Hill" exploits the homeliness of the familiar view at the expense of pretensions of foreign travelers. 
                        Drawing on "Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey" to inject memory into the prospect in "Written at Rouen" ("And here I stand--as here I stood / How many years ago!"), the poem must nonetheless claim the scene for English readers 
                        by prefacing the verse with a prose, guidebook-style description, as well as glossing lines with a footnote explaining that the heart of Richard the Lionheart 
                        is interred in Rouen Cathedral (generating the reflection, "But now, my breast, like yonder dome, / Where sleeps the Lion-heart, / Is half a temple--half a tomb, / But has no earthly part!)

                        In "Richmond-Hill", Watts draws on the "Intimations Ode" to trace an English span of life from childhood to maturity in sight of the Thames--not to explain what he has lost and gained, 
                        however, but what he has retained and the foreign traveler neglected in exchange for places like Rouen ("wheresoe'er my steps have been / One vision hath pursued me still; / . . . /

                                hinged in part on an innovation in binding, which substituted full calf for the printed and glazed paper&#x2010;covered boards and slipcase that were typical of the first British annuals, 
                                including <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT">Forget Me Not</title> and <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> itself. 
      <!-- START NEW TAGGING -->A well-preserved copy of <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName>&#x02BC;s second annual, the <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> for 1825, 
                                which was acquired by Princeton University Library Special Collections in 2010, suggests that Smith, Elder might be viewed as having developed the annual's reputation for splendor 
                                in its casing rather than supplanting a drab binding. The front cover of Relfe's slipcase is printed with an elaborate Gothic Revival design in multiple colors, 
                                the gothic tracery forming a window or portal enclosing the title, which is lettered in a gothic and scrolled calligraphic style. The slipcase spine is printed with a vertical gothic pillar showing statues in niches. 
                                The slipcase design corresponds stylistically to the volume's title page, which is also gothic revival but a distinct design, not printed from the same plate used for the slipcase cover. 
                                The title page is likewise printed in multiple colors, and the design is a gothic arch framing the title and publisher's imprint lettered in a calligraphic style 
                                (see PRINCETONLIBRARYSPECIALCOLLECTIONSBLOG-2010-04-10 &#x201C;&#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi> wears a most captivating appearance&#x2019;: 1825&#x201D;).</p>
                            <p>The boards of the Princeton copy also suggests that Smith, Elder was elaborating on, rather than eclipsing, the impression made by the earlier binding. Although paper or cloth, not leather, 
                                Relfe's front board is blind&#x2010;embossed with an arabesque design surrounding the borders 
                                (see PRINCETONLIBRARYSPECIALCOLLECTIONSBLOG-2010-04-10 &#x201C;&#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi> wears a most captivating appearance&#x2019;: 1825&#x201D;), 
                                whereas Smith, Elder's is a blind-embossed arabesque spreading over the entire surface of the boards, front and back. 
                                The Relfe arabesque design includes a lyre in the center-top and center-bottom borders, a device that in the Smith, Elder cover is made to stand out as a single lyre, 
                                blocked in gilt in the center of the full front cover. Thus, the main difference in the material impressions made by the Relfe and the Smith, Elder bindings was less one of degree than of kind, 
                                the Relfe Gothic Revival style being wholly abandoned for a Renaissance Revival style, and the means of protection exchanging a decorated slipcover (with an attached purple-silk ribbon-pull) 
                                for a calf binding with the decoration integrated into the embossed and gilded boards.</p>
                            <p>According to <persName corresp="#EJ">Eleanore Jamieson</persName>, the <hi rend="italic">arabesque</hi> pattern was regarded as a revival style hearkening to incunabula, and associated with Continental models of binding 
                                <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JAMIESONBINDINGSTYLES"><title type="essay"  corresp="#JAMIESONBINDINGSTYLES">&#x201C;The Binding Styles of the Gift Books and Annuals&#x201D;</title></ref>, 11). 
                                <persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName> speculates that the Smith, Elder arabesque-embossed leather covers of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> 
                                would specifically have suggested the bindings of prayer books and bibles&#x2014;the only expensively bound stock that retailers typically offered over the counter 
                                (as opposed to cheap temporary bindings, to be replaced by the consumer). These &#x201C;gospel&#x2010;like bindings&#x201D; may have been meant 
                                &#x201C;to convince the reading public of the wholesome value of the literature and engravings within&#x201D;

                                If that connection is valid, then Smith, Elder might be viewed as maintaining the religious connotation of Relfe's binding, but disassociating from the ecclesiastical appearance of Relfe's Gothic Revival design. 
                                The meaning of that change bears investigation, particularly as the rise in popularity of the annuals in the 1820s coincided with the growing religious controversy surrounding the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829.</p>
                            <p>In a notice of the <date when="1828">1828</date> volume of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1828"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>,

                                The reviewer considered &#x201C;substituting for the usual paper covering, an elegantly embossed leather binding" to be "altogether an improvement on the original plan,

                                The comment gestures at an audience potentially expanding beyond the female spheres of the &#x201C;boudoir and drawing-room&#x201D;, perhaps to include male readers, or, as urged by a review of the annuals for 1827 in the London Magazine, 
                                to reform the expectations of "light" and "popular" literature, that it may strive beyond the "idealess": "Now these little books go into the hands of young ladies chiefly, 
                                and they lie about drawing-rooms for several months. We would gladly seize this fine opportunity to make some deep and lasting impressions upon the sensible and amiable hearts, as well as upon the fine deep eyes, blue and black, of the Souvenir readers"
                                ("Souvenir Books, or Joint-Stock Literature" [unsigned review of Forget Me Not (1827) and Friendship's Offering (1827)], 479-80, 481). Such a mission would not have welcomed unnecessary religious controversy.</p>

                                Innovation and extravagance&#x2014;or at least the appearance of extravagance&#x2014;in bindings and engraved or lithographed front matter became characteristic of annuals, 
                                which used this immediate source of appeal to compete in a crowded market

                                Mechanization brought these material appeals within reach of the ordinary consumer; and mass&#x2010;produced fancy bindings in particular 
                                shifted traditional division of labor, since publishers took on the economic burden of bookbinding, which traditionally had been borne by the consumer.</p>

                                &#x201C;for the gratification of different tastes&#x201D;, perhaps suggesting that livelier customers avoided the sober brown

                                Today, the maroon&#x2010;brown is the most common color found in surviving copies, but a brighter red and possibly a green can still be found, as well.</p>
