                    <p>The first volume of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> appeared with the date <date when="1824">1824</date>,

                        The Ruskin family had some awareness of this early stage of the annual, since the volume for 1825, Relfe's second volume in the series, entered the family library 
                        with an inscription to <!-- TAG FOR BIO NOTE -->Mary Richardson (1815-49), Ruskin's cousin who first came to Camberwell to live with the family in 1827 
                        (Dearden, Library of John Ruskin, 122 [no. 953]; and for specific features of the 1825 Friendship's Offering, see Harris, "Feminizing the Textual Body", 601-2, 611).</p>
                        
                        <p>As <persName corresp="#KDH">Katherine D. Harris</persName> remarks, Relfe's first volume, for 1824, appeared only one year after the very first of the British annuals, 
                        <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi> (<date when="1823">1823</date>)</title>, 
                        was released by the firm of <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Rudolf Ackermann</orgName> in <date when="1822">1822</date> for the holiday season of <date notBefore="1822-11" notAfter="1823-02">1822&#x2013;23</date>. 
                        Harris transcribes the preface of this debut volume of Friendship's Offering and details the volume's contents, revealing a derivative and miscellaneous assemblage that exposes <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName> 
                        as aspiring only to mimic and capitalize on Ackermann's achievement. He had formed no clear conception of his production, which mixes features of the literary annual with the almanac and the eighteenth&#x2010;century &#x201C;pocket book&#x201D;. 
                        Indeed, a low estimation of the beginnings of Friendship's Offering was formed as early as <date when="1858">1858</date>, in a survey of the heyday of the annuals, which declared <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>&#x02BC;s production &#x201C;unpromising&#x201D;

                    <p>To become successful, <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> needed to shed the miscellaneous features derived from earlier models and to define its niche in the market. 
                        Its shortcomings were acknowledged by the editor, <persName corresp="#TKH">T. K. Hervey</persName> (<date notBefore="1799" notAfter="1859">1799&#x2013;1859</date>), 
                        in his prefatory remarks for the <date when="1826">1826</date> volume, <!-- Pleading &#x201C;difficulties&#x201D; that arose from the publication having only &#x201C;very recently, come into the present Editor&#x02BC;s hands" 
                        (<persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName> had in fact edited the title since <date when="1824">1824</date>), he-->which announced "a view to an entire change in . . . [the annual's] character and plan&#x201D;. 
                        He proposed &#x201C;alterations . . . consist[ing] in the removal of all those features which marked it as more peculiarly adapted for one season of the year than another&#x201d;, 
                        with the aim instead of &#x201C;combining, with the increased beauty of its embellishments, a high literary character&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName>, ed., <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> [<date when="1826">1826</date>]</ref>, vi).</p>
                        
                    <p>With this <date when="1826">1826</date> volume, the hodgepodge of features such as blank calendar pages, informational charts, and notated music that, according to <persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, had cluttered the first volume, did fall away 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title></ref>, 126). 
                        In their place, the improved "literary character" promised by Hervey is adumbrated with contributions by the likes of L.E.L. (Letitia Landon, 1802-38), 
                        James Montgomery (1771-1854), and Ruskin's future Camberwell schoolmaster, Reverend Thomas Dale (1797-1870). In order to create this "more marketable" item, Harris argues, 
                        Frienship's Offering became a "completely prefabricated book of printed memories" by its contributors, somewhat sacrificing the earlier 
                        "album-like qualities" that allowed both the giver and the recipient to personalize the volume with their own inscriptions 
                        (Harris, "Feminizing the Textual Body", 607). </p>

  <!-- RESUME TAGGING -->   was complimented by the <title type="periodical" corresp="#MONTHLYREVIEW"><hi rend="italic">Monthly Review</hi></title> on his success with the 1828 volume: "considering the advanced period of the season when his duties commenced", 
                        Knight had collected "a sufficient number" of literary pieces "readable enough . . . to while away an hour or two of a winter's evening" 
                        (Unsigned review of The Keepsake for 1828; Friendship's Offering for 1828; and The Christmas-Box [1828], 71). 
                        Faint praise, but the roster of contributors suggests that the editor and proprietors made a substantial investment in order to lure readers with celebrated names from both the current and previous generations--among them, 
                        Maria Edgeworth (1769-1849), Thomas de Quincey (1785-1859), and Robert Southey (1774-1843), then poet laureate. Other contributors to that maiden volume were well known to consumers of annuals, 
                        and their range was representative of readers' interests in the 1820s: Reverend Lisle Bowles (1762-1850), poet and Pope editor; John Bowring, translator (1792-1872); 
                        J. S. Buckingham (1786-1855) and J. A. St. John (1795-1875), travel writers; 
                        Crofton Croker (1798-1854), antiquarian; Thomas Gaspey (1788-1871), political writer and novelist; 
                        Barbara Hofland (1770-1844), children's writer; Thomas Hood (1799-1845), humorist; 
                        Mary Russell Mitford (1787-1855), dramatist and story writer; D. Lester Richardson (1801-65) and Emma Roberts (1791-1840), writers on life in colonial India; and

                        <p>The reviewer for the Monthly Review was more impressed by the quality of illustration in Smith, Elder's first volume, 
                            suggesting that the company had already earned its reputation for high-quality art reproduction: 
                        the plates were "really very creditable to the publishers", their "subjects . . . selected with great judgment" and "engraved in a chaste, artist-like style"

                            in the Friendship's Offering for 1835 (see "Saltzburg": Discussion). It is not known in what year Pringle became a regular dinner guest of the Ruskins at Herne Hill; 
                            perhaps the acquaintance was struck as early as autumn 1829, the season of Pringle's second volume of Friendship's Offering, when Ruskin's cousin, 
                            <!-- link to bio note -->Charles Richardson, was employed as a shop boy for Smith, Elder 
                            (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php#PERSONALCONNECTIONS">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books: The Annuals and the Ruskin Family</ref>). 
                            Pringle was a native Scotsman like John James Ruskin and the annual's proprietors, and he therefore represented both homeliness and (from the Ruskins' perspective) 
                            impressive literary connections, such as <!-- link to bio note -->James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd. 
                            Pringle could also relate exotic tales of his residence in <placeName corresp="#SOUTHAFRICA">South Africa</placeName>, where, like many 
                            Scots early in the century, he had emigrated in search of opportunities in the Cape Colony, which Britain acquired as a possession in the Congress of Vienna. 
                            He returned to England with disappointed hopes, but with a passion for the abolitionist cause.</p>
                        
                        <p>Pringle brought to his first volume, the Friendship's Offering for 1829, a noticeable Caledonian emphasis. 
                            Under Knight, Frienship's Offering for 1828 featured a handful of Scottish contributors. 
                            Under Pringle, the volume for 1829 presented over thirty contributions by Scots--more than a third of the total--including such poems as 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="GIBSONCORONACH">"The Highland Hunter's Coronach"</title> and <title type="poem" corresp="KENNEDYLEAVINGSCOTLAND">"On Leaving Scotland"</title>, and 
                            such tales as "The Covenanters: A Scottish Traditionary Tale". Scottish landscapes are also prominent among the engravings, 
                            although the list of embellishments leads with a classical subject by an English artist (see 
                            <ref type="internal" target="#SMITHELDERILLUSTRATI0N">"Made Expressly for the Work": The Art Scene in the <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> Annual</ref>). 
                            Balancing the appeal, contributions also include a "German legend" and an "Irish tale"; 
                            and the editor's preface does not draw attention to a Scottish emphasis, which may have resulted in part from Pringle relying on his personal connections in the north to help fill the volume. 
                            (In fact, the preface claims that the volume "promote[s] . . . a sound and liberal national taste" 
                            [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1829"><persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>, ed., <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1829"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> (<date when="1826">1829</date>)</ref>, vi].) 
                            Whether accidental or intentional, and while the Caledonian flavor would have entertained the Ruskins, and may even have been encouraged by the publishers, 
                            the approach may have entailed some risk.</p>
                            
                            <p>Published the same year, the short-lived annual The Anniversary, edited by Allan Cunningham, was advised by the Monthly Review to rein in the Celtic contributions, 
                            since "a beautiful work of art" required that "all the parts shall be in unison"; and without "mean[ing] to insinuate any dislike of the true Doric dialect, 
                            as it has been called, of Scotland", the reviewer advised that "in every instance the current language of England . . . prevail in the literature of the Annuals". 
                            The reviewer particularly objected to selections by the Church of Scotland clergyman, Edward Irving (1792-1834), given to a "'puritanic . . . phraseology, 
                            which literary persons belonging to that sect are too much in the habit of using on all occasions". In contrast, as an example of "neatly written essays on popular subjects", 
                            the reviewer quoted at length from The Anniversary's "essay on the Female Beauty of the Three Kingdoms", which discovers that female beauty is independent of nation, found wherever 
                            "gentleness of her nature and the kindliness of her heart throw a household halo around her person" 
                            (Unsigned review of The Anniversary (1829), The Amulet (1829), The Juvenile Forget Me Not (1829), and The Juvenile Keepsake (1829), 526, 530; 
                            M., "English, Scotch, and Irish Beauty", in Cunningham, ed., The Anniversary, 201-5, 205). The tendency of writers for the Monthly Review to denigrate authors for nonstandard English reached back to the journal's origins in the eighteenth century

                            <p>From Relfe's volumes to Smith, Elder's, the number of "embellishments" per volume remained twelve or thirteen, including the frontispiece and presentation plate, 
                            which form part of the frontmatter. (A <hi rend="italic">presentation plate</hi> is an engraved title page with a blank cartouche, in which the giver or owner could 
                                inscribe a name or brief message.) The number of plates was perhaps limited less by expense than by how many could be inserted between text signatures. 
                            While the number of plates could not be increased, differences between the two publishers' approaches to embellishment can be detected in terms of the aesthetics of the Sister Arts, 
                            the kinds of artwork sought for reproduction, and the personal tastes of editors. (The following account remains in process, given limited access to copies of certain years of Frienship's Offering.)</p>

                                <p>In the 1826 volume, the pairings of picture and poem reflect the Romantic-era transformation of the <hi rend="italic">ut pictura poesis</hi> aesthetic, 
                                    which Roy Park characterizes as an abandonment of the worn pictorialism of the eighteenth century 
                                    in favor of a view of the sister arts as "twin facets of a unified poetic experience" (Park, "'Ut Pictura Poesis': The Nineteenth-Century Aftermath", 156). 
                                    Ekphrastic poems in the volume pay tribute to a shared poetic experience, such as a poem accompanying an engraving of a Claude landscape, 
                                    in which the speaker declines to engage in the traditional contest between poet and painter, the rivalry of the Renaissance paragone: 
                                    "I feel / No envy of thy noble art, / . . . which, unto outward sense, / Speaks in a language so refined" 
                                    (Bernard Barton, "'Am I, Too, in Arcadia?'"; 
                                    the Claude is Landscape with the Marriage of Isaac and Rebecca [1648], 
                                    part of the Angerstein Collection purchased in 1824 for the National Gallery). 
                                    A similar emphasis on the poetic experience unifying the Sister Arts is adopted in a poem by L.E.L. to accompany an engraving of

                                    by the French painter in the Troubadour style, Pierre Nolasque Bergeret (1782-1863). 
                                    Despite the "face of death" imprinted on the figure of Raphael, "paler and colder than the marble bust", 
                                    the artist's "soul" remains undiminished, "leav[ing] its influence on the heart!", and in turn assuring the lasting poetic "memory" that is the stock-in-trade of the literary annual.

                                <p>Contemporary British figure pieces, including the frontispiece, were supplied by Richard Westall (1765-1836), 
                                    known for his illustrations of Romantic-era poetry and his evocative portraits of Byron. 
                                    His work, too, embodied the "poetic" spirit unifying the sister arts. As an 1824 tribute effused, Westall was considered an ideal portraitist of Byron, since 
                                    "Thou saw'st the poet, with a poet's eye, / And hence a poet's mind could well descry, / For thou, to graphic genius not confin'd, / Can'st boast the pow'rs of a poetic mind" 
                                    (John Taylor [1757-1832], "Lines on the Portrait of the Late Lord Byron, Painted by Richard Westall, Esq. RA", 
                                    quoted in Westall, "Richard Westall's Labours of Love", 60). Westall's poetic reputation perhaps counted for more than the intrinsic merit of the pictures, 
                                    which are feeble illustrations.</p>
                                
                                <p>Also reflected in the volume is a contemporary division between British and French approaches to the poetry of the Sister Arts, 
                                    however adventitiously the debate may have entered into the annual's production. The final plate, and the most distinguished, 
                                    presents a view of Rouen from Bon-Secours, beautifully drawn by Richard Parkes Bonington (1802-28) 
                                    (see Noon, Richard Parkes Bonington: The Complete Paintings, 121 [no. 57]). 
                                    The son of an &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9; British artist in France, Bonington received his training in the atelier of Baron Antoine-Jean Gros. 
                                    The Friendship's Offering plate derives from the coastal scenery of Normandy to which Bonington was drawn, just as he frequented Rouen to sketch its gothic architecture. 
                                    While picturesque subjects such as these were growing in popularity in France, neoclassicists such as Gros 
                                    rejected scenery that seemed random and meaningless when scaled against the traditional ordering of the arts. 
                                    French critics also associated the picturesque with the loose style of British artists, 
                                    such as the architectural drawing of <!-- link to note -->Samuel Prout who likewise sketched in Normandy. 
                                    The seeming disregard for finish by British painters violated the neoclassical priority 
                                    of disegno, the conceptual emphasis on design, line, and form 
                                    (Noon, Richard Parkes Bonington: The Complete Paintings, 14-18).</p>
                                
                                <p>Nonetheless, English style had recently gained impetus in France from the success of John Constable, Copley Fielding, and other British painters 
                                    at the Paris Salon of 1824. Fired by enthusiasm for British landscape art and for the naturalistic approach it represented, 
                                    Bonington visited London in 1825, in the company of Alexandre-Marie Colin (1798-1875), 
                                    Eug&#x00E8;ne Delacroix (1798-1863), and other young French artists in the vanguard of French Romanticism. 
                                    As contacts in London, Bonington relied on engravers, including the Cooke family, known for their work for J. M. W. Turner 
                                    (Noon, Richard Parkes Bonington: The Complete Paintings, 34-35). It was a younger member of that family, William John Cooke (1796-1865), 
                                    who engraved Bonington's Rouen on steel for the annual. Cooke brought state-of-the-art skill to the commission, 
                                    earning a medal in 1826 for his improvements in etching steel 
                                    (Hunnisett, Steel-engraved Book Illustration in England, 48-49).</p><!-- replace with Munday? -->
                                
                                <p>Other embellishments in the volume likewise reflect the tensions in French art between neoclassicism and Romanticism. 
                                    While the volume includes mythological subjects by Nicolas Magnard (1606-68) and 
                                    Pierre-Narcisse Gu&#x00E9;rin (1774-1833), two contributions by 
                                    Horace Vernet (1789-1863) combine battlefield scenes with genre. The loyalty of domestic animals features in 
                                    The Dog of the Regiment and The Dead Trumpeter, in which a dog and a horse, respectively, mourn over the corpses 
                                    of thei fallen owners. In poems paired with the scenes, T. K. Hervey constructed memories of home for the fallen soldiers. 
                                    These plates would have been considered by French critics as representative of the degeneration of the hierarchy of subject matter, 
                                    which they blamed on the commercialization of art through book illustration and popular spectacles like the diorama 
                                    (see Noon, Richard Parkes Bonington: The Complete Paintings, 24-30).</p>

                                    The firm would also have needed to extend their expertise beyond engraving and aquatint to commission steel engraving (see 
                                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php#STEELENGRAVING">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books: Steel Engraving</ref>).</p>
                            
                            <p>As one shift in emphasis from the annual's beginnings, it appears that, whereas Relfe inclined to an ut pictura poesis aesthetic centered on Old Masters and modern history painting, 
                                Smith, Elder advertised that their debut volume would feature engravings taken from recently exhibited British paintings, 
                                including art "painted expressly for the Work".  
                                If Smith, Elder decided strategically to feature pictures from recent London exhibitions, 
                                the choice shifted away from Relfe's reliance on the intrinsic prestige of history painting, much of it by French artists, 
                                to seek popular favor and institutional support at home. For consumers like the Ruskins, studying the plates and their accompanying ekphrastic poems and essays 
                                raised their awareness of London exhibiting institutions and poetic tropes for response.</p>

                                The artist was a history painter, John Wood (1801-70), who had recently gained recognition at the Royal Academy for such works as

                                In the following volume, for 1829, Wood created a frontispiece "expressly for this work",

                            <p>For 1829, while Wood's frontispiece maintains the feature of contemporary English historical painting, other embellishments reflect the Scottish emphasis 
                                that Pringle summmoned in the literary contributions (see <ref type="internal" target="#PRINGLE">The Pringle Editorship</ref>). 
                                The plates pivot away from figure art to landscape, introduced early and prominently with 
                                <title type="artwork" corresp="#MARTINGLENLYNDEN"><hi rend="italic">Glen-Lynden</hi></title>, 
                                a "landscape with ruins, designed and engraved for this work by John Martin". 
                                In 1829, Martin (1789-1854) stood at the height of his fame for his panoramic paintings of apocalyptic biblical events; 
                                and since 1826, he had been producing from his own studio the large mezzotints on steel that extended the audience for his popular paintings, such as the prints 
                                Joshua Commanding the Sun to Stand Still (1827; painting first exhibited 1816); 
                                and The Deluge (1828; painting first exhibited 1826). 
                                At the same time, Martin was designing and producing small mezzotints for the annuals, 
                                publishing over twenty plates between 1826 and 1837 in the Amulet, the Literary Souvenir, and other annuals. 
                                Among the earliest of these small prints was <title type="artwork" corresp="#MARTINGLENLYNDEN"><hi rend="italic">Glen-Lynden</hi></title> 
                                for Friendship's Offering (Wees, "Darkness Visible", 3, 29-30, 33 [cat. no. 24]).</p>
                                
                                <p>Rendered in Martin's sublime style, <title type="artwork" corresp="#MARTINGLENLYNDEN"><hi rend="italic">Glen-Lynden</hi></title> 
                                overwhelms its homely pairing, the poem "Glen-Lynden: A Tale of Teviotdale" by the volume editor, 
                                whose persona humbles himself as the "last and lowliest of the train" of poets to pay "pious tribute" to "haunted Teviot", "the loved mother he has left behind". 
                                Pringle preferred the traditional name <hi rend="italic">Teviotdale</hi> for the valley of the Teviot River near Kelso in Roxburghshire, where he was born. 
                                The name <hi rend="italic">Glen Lynden</hi>, although used here for a fictional Border glen, was in real life the name Pringle bestowed on the settlement in Cape Colony. 
                                (Vigne, Thomas Pringle, 79). In the posthumous edition of Pringle's poems, "Glen-Lynden" would be re-presented as a fragment of "The Emigrants" intended to incorporate 
                                a fictionalized account of the immigration to South Africa. Standing alone, "Glen Lynden" could "call to mind / The scenes that Scottish hearts to their dear country bind" 
                                even for those in "foreign lands" only as far as England like the Ruskins

                                <p>As if designed as a melancholy reminder specifically for the Ruskin family, the theme of Scottish landscape with ruins 
                                    continues in volume 29 with Campbell Castle, 
                                drawn by George Arnald (1763-1841) and supported by a poem by David Macbeth Moir ("Delta", 1798-1851)

                                The castle is located in the Ochil Hills, which the Ruskins passed through in their journeys north to visit the family of 
                                John James's sister, Jessie Richardson, in Perth--journeys now curtailed by the deaths of Jessie and two of her children in 1826-28.

                            <p>however, the frontmatter seems designed to assure continuity with the genre of the literary album, highlighting the same Romantic-era adaptation of <hi rend="italic">ut pictura poesis</hi> 
                            as found in Relfe's volume 26. A dedicatory poem presents a female recipient, the "Lady of the Book", 
                            with this "album" as a "fair enclosure" uniting the sister arts in "quintessence of Po&#x00EB;sy" 
                            (James Montgomery, "The First Leaf of an Album"). The frontispiece, "painted . . . expressly for this work", is a classical subject, 
                            , just as volume 26 had gravitated to Old Masters. 
                            The artist, "J. Wood", was probably the history painter . This gateway to the volume's sister-arts experience appears consistent with Smith, Elder's debut volume, for 1828, 
                            which opened with "A Sylph <title type="periodical" corresp="#MIRROROFLITERATURE"><hi rend="italic">The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction</hi></title>

                        The first volume of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> under the new proprietorship received a complimentary notice in  
                        <title type="periodical" corresp="#MIRROROFLITERATURE"><hi rend="italic">The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction</hi></title>, 
                        the review focusing first on the &#x201C;exterior, which is somewhat novel in taste, . . . by substituting for the usual paper covering 
                        [i.e., like the printed paper boards then covering the <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title>], an elegantly embossed leather binding. 
                        This is altogether an improvement on the original plan, since the slight coverings of silk or paper is scarcely safe out of the drawing&#x2010;room or boudoir, 
                        and some of the contributions to the &#x2018;annuals&#x2019; entitle them to a higher stand&#x201D;
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SPIRITOFTHEANNUALS"><title type="periodical" corresp="#MIRROROFLITERATURE">&#x201C;Spirit of &#x2018;The Annuals&#x2019; for 1828&#x201D;</title></ref>, 418). 
                        By the &#x201C;original plan&#x201D;, the writer refers apparently to the binding used by <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>, 
                        which consisted of glazed paper boards, printed with a decorative and typographic cover, in imitation of the binding used for the <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> 
                        (the latter already moving to silk; see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT2015"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title></ref>, 133).
                        The new binding of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> featured an arabesque design that was blind embossed into the full surface of the dark leather cover, 
                        with a lyre design blocked in gilt in the center of the front cover. As <persName corresp="#EJ">Eleanore Jamieson</persName> remarks in 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JAMIESONBINDINGSTYLES"><title type="essay"  corresp="#JAMIESONBINDINGSTYLES">&#x201C;The Binding Styles of the Gift Books and Annuals&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        the arabesque pattern was regarded as a revival style hearkening to the early book, and the style was associated with Continental models
                        (p. 11; and see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p>The annuals dueled to be judged by their covers, the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> having set an initial standard with its printed and glazed paper boards, 
                        cloth spine, and slipcase, later replaced by a silk cover 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN"><persName corresp="#JFORD">Ford</persName>, <title type="biography" corresp="#FORDACKERMAN"><hi rend="italic">Ackermann</hi></title></ref>, 65).  
                        Innovation and extravagance&#x2014;or at least the appearance of extravagance&#x2014;in bindings and engraved or lithographed front matter became characteristic of annuals, 
                        which used this immediate source of appeal to compete in a crowded market 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FAXONLITERARYANNUALS">Faxon, <title type="bibliography" corresp="FAXONLITERARYANNUALS"><hi rend="italic">Literary Annuals</hi></title></ref>, xiv&#x2013;xvi). 
                        Mechanization brought these material appeals within reach of the ordinary consumer; and mass&#x2010;produced fancy bindings in particular 
                        shifted traditional division of labor, since publishers took on the economic burden of bookbinding, which conventionally had been borne by the consumer.
                        <persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName> also speculates that the annuals&#x02BC; elaborately embossed leather covers suggested the bindings of prayer books and bibles&#x2014;the only other expensively 
                        bound stock that retailers typically offered over the counter (as opposed to cheap temporary bindings, to be replaced by the consumer). 
                        These &#x201C;gospel&#x2010;like bindings&#x201D; may have been meant &#x201C;to convince the reading public of the wholesome value of the literature and engravings within&#x201D;

                        Perhaps the comment in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#MIRROROFLITERATURE"><hi rend="italic">Mirror of Literature</hi></title> that the sturdier cover 
                        of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> matched its more substantial content inside, capable of subsisting beyond the lady&#x02BC;s boudoir,

                        Its binding was more sumptuous, and the engraving sharper and more consistent. To mark these improvements, <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> expanded the subtitle,

                        In <date when="1833">1833</date>, the title changed again, the annual having absorbed another existing publication, <hi rend="italic">Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi>, 
                        which had been published in <placeName corresp="#LIVERPOOL">Liverpool</placeName> since <date when="1828">1828</date>. This merger resulted in the title, 
                        <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi> (so the title appears on the typeset title page; 
                        for a time, the engraved frontispiece with the earlier title remained in production). 
                        This latest title was in use when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first appeared in the annual, in the issue,

                    <p>At the same time, a comparison of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s product with the volumes published by the annual&#x02BC;s creator, <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>, 
                        suggests that the new firm attempted to keep the interior uniform with earlier volumes, at least initially. 
                        As remarked about the 1826 volume edited by Hervey for Relfe, the annual was already responsive to the "poetic" sensibility that unified the sister arts during that period. . . </p>
