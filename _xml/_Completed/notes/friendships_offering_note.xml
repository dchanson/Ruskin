                                (Indeed, the first <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> traded on previous and somewhat dated success, featuring a series of emblematic treatments of the twelve months,

                                <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>&#x02BC;s preface seems bent on covering all bases for the possible marketability of his attempt at this miscellaneous venue&#x2014;to compete with Continental models (chiefly German) 
                                of the literary annual by translating the form to meet British taste; to supply the holiday gift market; to furnish (&#x201C;independently&#x201D;) both &#x201C;graphic decorations&#x201D; and &#x201C;original contributions . . . from popular pens&#x201D;; 
                                to &#x201C;partially . . . supply&#x201D; the features of a pocket&#x2010;book, thus incorporating yet &#x201C;elevat[ing]&#x201D; the function of this annual diary or &#x201C;remembrancer&#x201D;; 
                                and a purpose not mentioned directly by the competitors, to seize on the British pent&#x2010;up, post&#x2010;Napoleonic desire for travel, actual or virtual, by pairing engraved &#x201C;views&#x201D; of foreign cities with descriptions based on &#x201C;personal observation&#x201D;

                            <p>In an <date when="1858">1858</date> article in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#BOOKSELLER"><hi rend="italic">Bookseller</hi></title>, 
                                attempting an appreciative critical history of the annuals when they had declined in popularity, <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>&#x02BC;s early volumes 
                                were criticized for their weak contents and poor production and also their haphazard miscellaneity&#x2014;&#x201C;unpromising&#x201D; assemblages of &#x201C;indifferent views of Continental cities&#x201D;, &#x201C;poor verses&#x201D;, 
                                and the occasional &#x201C;tale by <persName corresp="#AO">Mrs. Opie</persName>&#x201D; (i.e., <persName corresp="#AO">Amelia Opie</persName> [<date notBefore="1769" notAfter="1853">1769&#x2013;1853</date>]). 
                                The writer particularly dwelled on the inclusion of &#x201C;ruled pages for memoranda&#x201D;, as typically found in a pocket&#x2010;book, as the proof of unconsidered paste&#x2010;up, 
                                a feature that the writer condemned likewise in the <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENSHIPSOFFERING">Offering</title>&#x02BC;s early rivals, <title type="annual" corresp="#FORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> and <title type="annual" corresp="#GRACES"><hi rend="italic">The Graces</hi></title>

                                In the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, however, reviews of <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName>&#x02BC;s early volumes suggest that critics embraced the miscellany. 
                                <title type="periodical" corresp="#GENTLEMANSMAGAZINE"><hi rend="italic">The Gentleman&#x02BC;s Magazine</hi></title>, reviewing the <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1825"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi> for <date when="1825">1825</date></title>, explained that &#x201C;the aim of the editor . . . appears to have been to combine the elegance of art 
                                and flowers of literature with the utility of the superior class of pocket&#x2010;books, and in this . . .  he has in a great degree succeeded&#x201D;&#x2014;adding parenthetically, not that <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName> should have aimed at greater uniformity of purpose, 
                                but that he might have made up for &#x201C;the deficiency of an almanack&#x201D;, although admittedly that addition &#x201C;would have necessarily much increased the price&#x201D;

In his prefatory remarks for <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1826">1826</date> volume, <persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName> announced &#x201C;a view to an entire change in . . . [the annual&#x02BC;s] character and plan&#x201D;, 
                                by shifting emphasis from the transience of an annual to the permanence of a keepsake: the &#x201C;alterations&#x201D; were to &#x201C;consist in the removal of all those features which marked it as more peculiarly adapted for one season of the year than another&#x201D;. 
                                Starting with that volume, the almanac and pocket&#x2010;book features were suppressed, and the subtitle shortened to &#x201C;A Literary Album&#x201D; to signal the concentrated focus. 
                                What had happened was not solely <persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName>&#x02BC;s inspiration, however, but a broader trend reflected in a <title type="periodical" corresp="#MONTHLYREVIEW"><hi rend="italic">Monthly Review</hi></title> article 
                                published one year earlier, which is clearly the source of <persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName>&#x02BC;s announcement of changes being made in <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>. The article presents a brief critical history of the British annual, 
                                celebrating the &#x201C;keen and enterprising spirit of emulation&#x201D; that has enabled &#x201C;our countrymen&#x201D; in a short time to have so improved on the German Taschenbuch that &#x201C;the least elegant of . . . [the British annuals] is greatly superior to any thing produced on the Continent&#x201D;. 
                                The key to this progress, according to the article, lay in a marker that carried a rebuke to the proprietor of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Frienship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>:</p>

                            <p>Since <persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName> quotes the phrase in italics nearly verbatim, it is evident that this review had determined <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName> to rescue <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> from among the &#x201C;few minor productions&#x201D; 
                                that formed the &#x201C;exception&#x201D; to this brilliant tale of British progress. In <date when="1825">1825</date>, probably only one annual represented the pinnacle of achievement&#x2014;the <title type="annual" corresp="#LITERARYSOUVENIR"><hi rend="italic">Literary Souvenir</hi></title>,

Although only first published in <date when="1825">1825</date>, the <title type="annual" corresp="#LITERARYSOUVENIR"><hi rend="italic">Literary Souvenir</hi></title> already benefitted 
                                from a nationalistic evolutionary narrative. (The narrative gained credence from the decision of the <title type="annual" corresp="#LITERARYSOUVENIR"><hi rend="italic">Souvenir&#x02BC;s</hi></title> publisher, <persName corresp="#RH">Hurst, Robinson</persName>, to make way for funding the <title type="annual" corresp="#LITERARYSOUVENIR"><hi rend="italic">Literary Souvenir</hi></title> 
                                by discontinuing an existing annual, <title type="annual" corresp="#GRACES"><hi rend="italic">The Graces</hi></title>, after publishing only one volume. Although the exchange was friendly, <title type="annual" corresp="#GRACES"><hi rend="italic">The Graces</hi></title>, which was born the same year as <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>, 
                                ironically contributed to the evolutionary narrative by claiming British superiority over Continental models for having disburdened itself of the their &#x201C;loaded . . . weight&#x201D; of almanac features, 
                                but then set itself &#x201C;to embrace . . . every topic of accomplishment, elegance, and polite information, that can interest the general reader&#x201D;,

In content, <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName>&#x02BC;s inclusion of pocket&#x2010;book features such as blank diary pages does not necessarily suggest incoherence. As <persName corresp="#SLODGE">Sara Lodge</persName> has noted, during the post&#x2010;Waterloo period <persName corresp="#JHLH">Leigh Hunt</persName> 
                                produced an item, the <title type="annual" corresp="#HUNTSLITERARYPOCKETBOOK"><hi rend="italic">Literary Pocket&#x2010;Book</hi></title> (<date notBefore="1818" notAfter="1822">1818&#x2013;22</date>), which invited the consumer to inscribe poetic effusions on a blank &#x201C;Calendar of Nature&#x201D;, thus activating the reader to put literary response to use in constructing 
                                &#x201C;a sort of Court Calendar&#x201D; of one&#x02BC;s own, as <persName corresp="#JHLH">Hunt</persName> put it (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LODGEROMANTICRELIQUARIES"><persName corresp="#SLODGE">Lodge</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#LODGEROMANTICRELIQUARIES">&#x201C;Romantic Reliquaries&#x201D;</title></ref>, 25). Nonetheless, <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName> seems initially to have had trouble positioning his annual to respond to the conflicting audience demands of the transitional, post&#x2010;Waterloo period. 
                                Externally, the cover and slipcase of the <date when="1825">1825</date> volume have been found to be unexpectedly splendid, as proved by a well-preserved copy acquired by

                            Many contributors labored as editors of competing annuals, magazines, and newspapers, including <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s future personal editor,

                            The takeover was made most immediately apparent to the public by an innovative embossed leather binding, which included the publisher&#x02BC;s name along with the annual&#x02BC;s title integrated into the cover design and stamped sharply into the material.

                            Sales rose, eventually peaking at ten thousand copies per year, helping to assure the fortunes of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> as a publisher.

                            At the same time, they enhanced the keepsake element by redesigning the presentation plate to give greater scope to the presenter and presentee:

                            In his autobiography, <persName corresp="#CK">Knight</persName> describes his role in the transition between publishers as hectic:

                            He credits the success of the ordeal to friends who &#x201C;rallied round&#x201D; with contributions that he considered 
                            more &#x201C;original&#x201D; than the &#x201C;sentimental stories&#x201D; and &#x201C;mawkish&#x201D; verses &#x201C;with their bowers and flowers&#x201D; typical of the annuals

                                which the magazine called &#x201C;the system&#x201D;: &#x201C;The application to distinguished individuals for a specimen of their genius . . . 
                                is not likely to produce any thing beyond a very cold effort; so many of these Annuals, moreover, now appear, 
                                that many writers will be over&#x2010;tasked; it is impossible that they can have a good thing for each of these publications, 
                                which we fear in their rivalry will injure one another like the <placeName corresp="#PADDINGTON">Paddington</placeName> stages, which go from the <placeName type="building" corresp="#BANKOFENGLAND">Bank</placeName> every quarter of an hour,

                        The speaker declines to engage in rivalry with the painter&#x2014;that is, the Renaissance <hi rend="italic">paragone</hi>, which put the competing descriptive powers of writer and painter at odds, instead of unified in their &#x201C;poetry&#x201D;.

                        The poem is formulaic because it has nothing to say about the emotions suggested by <persName corresp="#CLAUDE">Claude</persName>&#x02BC;s landscape in itself

The subject was germane to an ekphrastic miscellany like an annual, 
                        since <persName corresp="#RSU">Raphael</persName> had come to regarded as embodying the art of painting itself. For the French academic artworld, however, <persName corresp="#RSU">Raphael</persName> stood for the art of painting as a 
                        &#x201C;symbolic embodiment of French artistic ideals&#x201D;. He was a &#x201C;&#x2018;modern <persName corresp="#APELLES">Apelles</persName>&#x2019;&#x201D; answering to &#x201C;that complete perfection&#x201D; of art

                        but during the French Empire, when <persName corresp="NBE">Napoleon</persName> had confiscated <persName corresp="#RSU">Raphael</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="artwork" corresp="#RAPHAELTRANSFIGURATION"><hi rend="italic">Transfiguration</hi></title> from the <placeName corresp="#VATICAN">Vatican</placeName>, 
                        the Raphaelesque aesthetic ideal also became politicized. <persName corresp="#PNB">Bergeret</persName>&#x02BC;s depiction of <persName corresp="#RSU">Raphael</persName>&#x02BC;s wake, attended by powerful nobles as <persName corresp="#GV">Vasari</persName> recounted, 
                        was meant to illustrate the premise that great men are glorified by their homage to great artists. If <persName corresp="#RSU">Raphael</persName> embodied the art of painting, 
                        <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName> would be its possessor (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROSENBERGRAPHAELANDNAPOLEON"><persName corresp="#MROSENBERG">Rosenberg</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#ROSENBERGRAPHAELANDNAPOLEON">&#x201C;Raphael&#x02BC;s Transfiguration and Napoleon&#x02BC;s Cultural Politics&#x201D;</title></ref>, 188, 186, 193, 198).</p>

                        and brings it down to size for the annual. <persName corresp="#RSU">Raphael</persName>&#x02BC;s art is characterized as deathless, not because of the codependency of art with the power of the state, 
                        but because of the shared poetic emotion that appeals to the ordinary heart. 
                        The prone figure of <persName corresp="#RSU">Raphael</persName> is turned with the &#x201C;face of death&#x201D; to the viewer, 
                        a face that is &#x201C;paler and colder than the marble bust&#x201D;, but the artist&#x02BC;s &#x201C;soul&#x201D; remains undiminished, not by its fixation in a classical bust,

                        subjects that especially attracted <persName corresp="#RPB">Bonington</persName>&#x2014;such as the coastal scenery of <placeName corresp="#NORMANDY">Normandy</placeName> 
                        and the Gothic architecture of <placeName corresp="#ROUEN">Rouen</placeName>&#x2014;seemed random and meaningless, low on the scale of the traditional ordering of the Sister Arts. 
                        Students&#x02BC; understanding should be elevated by historical and religious subjects rather than by landscape&#x2014;much less by the localized, provincial scenes 
                        that characterized the British school, as opposed to the timeless classical landscapes of the French tradition. Yet, to the alarm of those who defended 
                        the tradition of <persName corresp="#AJG">Gros</persName>&#x02BC;s teacher, <persName corresp="#JLD">Jacques&#x2010;Louis David</persName> (<date notBefore="1748" notAfter="1825">1748&#x2013;1825</date>), 
                        British&#x2010;influenced picturesque subjects were gaining popularity in <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>. French critics also rejected the loose style of the British school, 
                        such as the textured brushstrokes of oils by <persName corresp="#CONSTABLEARTIST">John Constable</persName>, and the tonal rather than linear definition of architectural drawing 
                        by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="prout_samuel_note.php"><persName corresp="#SP">Samuel Prout</persName></ref> and others of the <orgName corresp="#MONROSCHOOL">&#x201C;Monro School&#x201D;</orgName>. 
                        (<persName corresp="#RPB">Bonington</persName> almost certainly encountered <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName> personally in <placeName corresp="#NORMANDY">Normandy</placeName> 
                        and in <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName>.) The seeming disregard for finish by British painters violated the priority that neoclassicism awarded to <hi rend="italic">disegno</hi>, 
                        the conceptual emphasis on design, line, and form (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#NOONBONINGTONPAINTINGS"><persName corresp="#PNOON">Noon</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#NOONBONINGTONPAINTINGS"><hi rend="italic">Richard Parkes Bonington: The Complete Paintings</hi></title></ref>, 14&#x2013;18;

                    <p>Nonetheless, English style had recently gained impetus in <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> from the success of <persName corresp="#CONSTABLEARTIST">John Constable</persName>,

                        Fired by enthusiasm for British landscape art and for the naturalistic approach it represented, <persName corresp="#RPB">Bonington</persName> visited <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> 
                        in <date when="1825">1825</date>, in the company of <persName corresp="#AMC">Alexandre&#x2010;Marie Colin</persName> (<date notBefore="1798" notAfter="1875">1798&#x2013;1875</date>),

                        For his contacts in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, <persName corresp="#RPB">Bonington</persName> relied on engravers, including the <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="cooke_family_note.php">Cooke family</ref>,

<!-- NEW DCH review --><p>Ironically, as presented in the two annuals, the French&#x2010;English affiliations behind <persName corresp="#RPB">Bonington</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s river scenes are turned into rivalries. 
                        Both poems composed respectively for the plates rely on Wordsworthian tropes of return and loss to prompt wistful responses to the scenes; however, the speaker of

                    <p>Besides landscape in volume 26 of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>, 
                        figure compositions by French artists likewise reflect the tensions between neoclassicism and Romanticism.  
                        In two plates based on paintings by <persName corresp="#HV">Horace Vernet</persName> (<date notBefore="1789" notAfter="1863">1789&#x2013;1863</date>),

                        battlefield scenes are combined with genre subjects highlighting the loyalty of domestic animals amid the carnage of war. From the standpoint of the critic

                        represented a confusion of genre and history painting, threatening the conceptual basis of <hi rend="italic">grande peinture</hi>

                        Worse, <persName corresp="#HV">Vernet</persName> disseminated a taste for such mixed subjects by embracing contemporary forms of art reproduction, such as lithography and aquatint, 
                        which challenged the authority given to line engraving by the <orgName corresp="#ACADEMYOFFRANCE">French Academy</orgName>

                    <p>Overall, volume 26 of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> would have been regarded by a traditionalist French critic as representative 
                        of how the invidious commercialization of art through book illustration, and through such popular spectacles as the diorama, threatened a degeneration of the ideology propping up the traditional ordering of the arts. 
                        Even the volume&#x02BC;s single example approaching Davidian neoclassicism (softened by color and eroticism),

                                blocked in gilt in the center of the full front cover. Thus, again, a comparison of the <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName> and the <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> embossed bindings can be viewed in terms of continuity as well as of change in kind&#x2014;retaining and developing some design elements, 
                                as the new machine&#x2010;embossing technology was applied first to paper and then to leather.</p>

                                The reviewer regarded the &#x201C;substituting for the usual paper covering [i.e., the former printed and glazed paper boards], an elegantly embossed leather binding&#x201d; to be &#x201C;altogether an improvement on the original plan,

                                A perceived advantage of embossed leather appears to have been to combine luxury with durability, overcoming the need for a slipcase; however, <persName corresp="#EJ">Eleanore Jamieson</persName> comments that the leather bindings were not as practical as they appeared. 
                                The embossing could not withstand shelfwear, and the books remained on the drawing&#x2010;room table (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JAMIESONENGLISHEMBOSSEDBINDINGS"><title type="book" corresp="JAMIESONENGLISHEMBOSSEDBINDINGS"><hi rend="italic">English Embossed Bindings</hi></title></ref>, 3).</p>

                                As was being urged contemporaneously in a review of the annuals for <date when="1827">1827</date> in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#LONDONMAGAZINE"><hi rend="italic">London Magazine</hi></title>,

                                by offering the leather binding in a variety of colors. According to a review of the first <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> volume (<date when="1828">1828</date>), 
                                &#x201C;the colour . . . [was] varied&#x201D; in the leather binding &#x201C;for the gratification of different tastes&#x201D;

                                Today, surviving copies are found most commonly in a sober maroon&#x2010;brown, but a brighter red and possibly a green can still be found, as well.</p>

                            <p>The design of the <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> embossing was called <hi rend="italic">arabesque</hi>, 
                                a formal floral and leaf pattern, suggestive of Renaissance or Rococo ornament, as distinct from <hi rend="italic">cathedral</hi> patterns, in the style of Gothic architectural ornament

                                The cathedral style was associated with devotional publications, although, as we have seen, the printed boards and slipcase of the <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName> annual might be called <hi rend="italic">cathedral</hi>. 
                                <!--A cheaper alternative means of embossing was to employ

                                would have suggested the bindings of prayer books and bibles&#x2014;the only bound stock, besides gift books, that retailers typically offered over the counter 
                                (as opposed to temporary paper&#x2010;covered boards, meant to be replaced by the consumer). These &#x201C;gospel&#x2010;like bindings&#x201D; may have been meant 
                                &#x201C;to convince the reading public of the wholesome value of the literature and engravings within&#x201D;

                                If these associations are valid, then <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> might be viewed as maintaining the sacred connotation of <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName>&#x02BC;s binding; however, by replacing a cathedral design with an arabesque,
                                the later publisher may have disassociated their new look from a more specifically ecclesiastical appearance&#x2014;a possible source of anxiety, as the rise in popularity of the annuals in the later <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> coincided with the growing religious controversy surrounding the <title type="law" corresp="#CATHOLICEMANCIPATION">Catholic Emancipation Act</title> of <date when="1829">1829</date>.</p>

                            <p>While the decorated leather binding was able to dispense with a slipcase, new copies were protected by a paper wrapper. 
                                As <persName corresp="#GMSMITH">George Murray Smith</persName> (<date notBefore="1824" notAfter="1901">1824&#x2013;1901</date>) recalled, when he was a youth learning the business from the bottom up in his father&#x02BC;s firm, 
                                he took part in the preparation of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> for its holday&#x2010;season release by enclosing copies in their wrappers: 
                                &#x201C;&#x2018;For two or three days before the day of appearance everybody remained after the shop had closed. 
                                Tables were set out, and we sealed up each copy in a wrapper. When the work was all over we were regaled with wine and cake and sang songs&#x2019;&#x201D;
                                (quoted in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER"><persName corresp="#LHUXLEY">Huxley</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER"><hi rend="italic">House of Smith, Elder</hi></title></ref>, 14). 
                                The wrapper was a distinct style of <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1899">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date> dust&#x2010;jacket that completely enclosed the book like gift&#x2010;wrapping, 
                                the point being both to protect the fancy binding and to market the annual as a seasonal gift.

                                of a publisher&#x02BC;s dust&#x2010;jacket or wrapper (i.e., a paper envelope manufactured and applied by the publisher, as opposed to handmade or bespoke dust&#x2010;jackets contrived for private or institutional use, which are known to have existed much earlier;

                                It is not known whether <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName> used a wrapper to provide additional protection for copies of his <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> in their printed slipcases.</p>
                                <p>As <persName corresp="#MRG">Mark Godburn</persName> explains, the history of <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1899">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date> publishers&#x02BC; dust&#x2010;jackets, as told by <date notBefore="1900" notAfter="1999">twentieth&#x2010;century</date> bibliographers, 
                                    attributed their emergence to publishers&#x02BC; adoption of ready&#x2010;made bindings, which resulted from the innovation and mechanization of binding processes in the <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1829">first two decades of the century</date>. 
                                    While the earlier bibliographic account fixated on the invention of cloth binding, which was developed in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> at about the same time as case binding

                                    <persName corresp="#MRG">Godburn</persName> points out that dust&#x2010;jackets and wrappers were made a necessity by the broader variety of fancy bindings early in the century, not just the more decorated examples of cloth bindings; 
                                    and he suggests that the paper coverings were especially associated with marketing the annuals and their predecessors, the pocket books. 
                                    The surviving wrapper for the <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1830"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering . . . for <date when="1830">1830</date></hi></title> reveals that even this ephemeral covering was designed to flatter buyers with a luxury commodity. 
                                    <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> had it made from quality paper, and fastened it with red sealing wax. It was printed so that, when folded around the book, 
                                    the front, back, and spine of the package would show a decorated title, advertisements for additional collector&#x02BC;s items 
                                    (e.g., separate portfolios of the volume&#x02BC;s engravings), and the annual&#x02BC;s signature verse epigraph, which the buyer would find also inside, printed on the title page, 
                                    having been authored by the winner of the publisher&#x02BC;s contest for an appropriate motto 
                                    (16&#x2013;20, 30, 28; and for the motto contest, see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER"><persName corresp="#LHUXLEY">Huxley</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER"><hi rend="italic">House of Smith Elder</hi></title></ref>, 12).
