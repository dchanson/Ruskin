      was published by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="allen_george_note.php"><persName corresp="#GA">George Allen</persName></ref> in <date when="1891">1891</date>. The two&#x2010;volume edition was released in the two forms that, by then, 
      <persName corresp="#GA">Allen</persName> had established on a plan that was profitable while remaining responsive to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s standards of quality for bookmaking and to his ideas of fair trade in selling and distributing books. 
                    That is, for modest consumers, <persName corresp="#GA">Allen</persName> made the two volumes available for ten shillings net, in the sturdy and serviceable <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="uniform_edition_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSUNIFORMEDITION">Uniform Edition</title></ref>. 
                    For collectors, <persName corresp="#GA">Allen</persName> produced a deluxe edition, lavishing his craftsman&#x02bc;s love of fine bookmaking on what a <date when="1900">1900</date> advertisement described as 
      &#x201c;a Large Edition, with 23 Illustrations in Photogravure from Drawings by the Author and Facsimiles of MSS. Medium 4to&#x201d;, priced at thirty shillings for the two volumes 
      (reproduced in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DAWSONPEOPLESRUSKIN"><persName corresp="#PDAWSON">Dawson</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#DAWSONPEOPLESRUSKIN"><hi rend="italic">The People&#x02bc;s Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, ii). 
                    Even in the less expensive <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="uniform_edition_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSUNIFORMEDITION">Uniform Edition</title></ref> format, a few plates were bound into volume 1, which facsimiled samples of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s boyhood handwriting&#x2014;embellishments

                        <p>Sporadic evidence suggests that plans for publication of the poems developed over a number of years. 
                            Presumably, from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s standpoint, his father&#x02bc;s private publication of <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1850_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1850"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> by <persName corresp="#JR">J. R.</persName> (<date when="1850">1850</date>)</ref> had long ago brought to a close 
                            any perceived need for further collecting of the poems. Ironically, it was the existence of that private publication that, 
                            because of its rarity and increasing interest as a collector&#x02bc;s item in the final third of the century, prompted the American publisher 
                            <orgName corresp="#JWILEY">John Wiley &#x0026; Sons</orgName> to release an unauthorized edition, 
                            <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1882"><hi rend="italic">Poems by John Ruskin</hi></title>, in <date when="1882">1882</date>. 
                            The volume was &#x201c;collected and edited&#x201d; by <persName corresp="#JOWRIGHT">John Osborne Wright</persName>, 
                            basing his copytext on poems published in the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">literay annuals</ref>. 
                            The wording of the title page, <hi rend="italic">collected and edited</hi>, was clearly designed to evoke the sought&#x2010;after 
                            <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1850"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> by <persName corresp="#JR">J. R.</persName> &#x201c;collected | <date when="1850">1850</date>&#x201d;; 
                            and <persName corresp="#JOWRIGHT">Wright</persName>&#x02bc;s preface highlighted the rising desirability of the <date when="1850">1850</date> volume, 
                            while pretending to scoff at the rare&#x2010;book market in which &#x201c;copies have become virtually inaccessible except to the most rabid bibliomaniac, 
                            whose heavy purse enables him to successfully outbid competitors in the auction room and bookstore&#x201d;. 
                            A footnote pointed to the sale of a copy in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> two years earlier for 41 guineas 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS1886"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1886"><hi rend="italic">Poems by John Ruskin</hi></title>, ed. <persName corresp="#JOWRIGHT">Osborne</persName></ref>, i, iv). 
                            While the <persName corresp="#JOWRIGHT">Osborne</persName> edition capitalized on the phenomenon of 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.php">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</ref>, 
                            the book&#x02bc;s preface conveys an impression, however disingenuously, that its piracy was justified as a democratic public service, 
                            by bringing a rare and expensive resource within reach of the common reader.</p>
                        
                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> reacted aggressively to counter what he recognized as piracy, but his reaction was complicated by his ambivalence toward his early writings. 
                            Writing in <date when="1882">1882</date> to <ref type="note" target="wedderburn_note.php"><persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName></ref>, he fumed perhaps less about piratical practices by American publishers or about an opportunistic reprint trade 
                            that was simultaneousy pursued by British publishers&#x2014;issues that increasingly worried <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="allen_george_note.php"><persName corresp="#GA">George Allen</persName></ref> 
                            (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DAWSONGEORGEALLENOFSUNNYSIDE"><persName corresp="#PDAWSON">Dawson</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#DAWSONGEORGEALLENOFSUNNYSIDE"><hi rend="italic">George Allen of Sunnyside</hi></title></ref>, 22, 25&#x2013;26). 
                            Rather, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> at least pretended to be outraged more about English law, 
                            half&#x2010;playfully holding <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> personally responsible for his profession as a barrister: &#x201c;what a beast British law is! 
                            I&#x02bc;m obliged to print these&#x2014;at least a lot out of&#x2014;these idiotisms&#x2014;because another fellow&#x2014;a blackguard&#x2014;called Wily! [punning on <orgName corresp="#JWILEY">Wiley</orgName>&#x02bc;s name]&#x2014;has 
                            published them without my leave&#x2014;copyright of [the literary annual] <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02bc;s Offering</hi></title> being out! Theft &#x0026; libel in one!&#x201d; 
                            To <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, literary piracy was mere theft, whether at home or abroad, another way in which authors were denied 
                            fair pay in the tangled system of book dealing, from which he had attempted to extricate his work by setting up <persName corresp="#GA">Allen</persName> as his personal publisher. 
                            As <persName corresp="#BEM">Brian Maidment</persName> has argued, however, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s seemingly personalized complaints were more broadly polemical 
                            than the anger or resignation expressed by other British writers toward American piracy 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MAIDMENTPIRATEDBOOKS"><persName corresp="#BEM">Maidment</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#MAIDMENTPIRATEDBOOKS">&#x201c;John Ruskin, George Allen, and American Pirated Books&#x201d;</title></ref>, 7&#x2013;8). 
                            What especially piqued <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> about the <orgName corresp="#JWILEY">Wiley</orgName> edition was that, as he states in his letter to <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>, 
                            the publication combined theft with a &#x201c;libel&#x201d;, meaning that he disowned the poems as &#x201c;idiotisms&#x201d;, 
                            even as he was compelled to protect his property as a writer, since English copyright law failed to do so on his behalf 
                            (<title type="letter" corresp="#jr_to_aw_1882-02-07">Ruskin to A. Wedderburn</title>, <date when="1882-02-07">7 February 1882</date>,

                            an unknown hand docketed this letter &#x201c;83&#x201d; in pencil above <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s &#x201c;82&#x201d; for the year).</p>
                        
                        <p>With only seeming irrelevance, the letter goes on to call out <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>

                            (Although <persName corresp="#JAMW">Whistler</persName> won his suit, the victory was pyrrhic, since he was awarded only a farthing in damages, 
                            while the plaintiff and defendant had to split court costs, which amounted to ???<!-- DCH finish this --> on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s part [see <!-- SOURCE NEEDED --> 
                            (<title type="letter" corresp="#jr_to_aw_1882-02-07">Ruskin to A. Wedderburn</title>, <date when="1882-02-07">7 February 1882</date>,

                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s analogy equates what he sees as parallel cases of American chicanery from which English law 
                            failed to protect him&#x2014;the painter&#x02bc;s coxcomb &#x201c;impudence&#x201d; of charging high prices for &#x201c;flinging a pot of paint in the public face&#x201d;, 
                            and the &#x201c;blackguard&#x201d; wiliness of the American publisher scooping up <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s unprotected property and tossing it 
                            into an overheated book market, which the editor pretends to disparage while capitalizing on the exaggerated prices surrounding <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s poems. 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> leaves unsaid, however, whether it is the edition or the poems themselves that constitute a &#x201c;libel&#x201d; on his reputation. 
                            Would he have conceded the logic of <persName corresp="#JAMW">Whistler</persName>&#x02bc;s self&#x2010;defense that the pricing of any portion of his work ought to be calibrated according to the artist&#x02bc;s 
                            &#x201c;knowledge of a lifetime&#x2012d;? It would seem that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> ought to have allowed the point, 
                            given the biographical approach that he later adopted in his preface to his own edition, the <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title>, 
                            attributing a &#x201c;peculiar interest&#x201d; to the seemingly worthless juveniia as a witness to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s &#x201c;development&#x201d; and &#x201c;growth&#x201d;

Although published in the year of the <title type="law" corresp="#CHACEACT">International Copyright Act (&#x201c;Chace Act&#x201d;)</title>,

                            Nonetheless, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02bc;s edition was published in the <placeName corresp="#USA">United States</placeName> legally, as part of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSBRANTWOODEDITION">Brantwood Edition</title> of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s works, 
                            which was produced under an agreement with the <placeName corresp="#NYC">New York</placeName> firm, <orgName corresp="#MERRILLCO">Charles E. Merrill &#x0026; Company</orgName>. While the 
                            <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSBRANTWOODEDITION">Brantwood Edition</title> did not prove very profitable, it did pay royalties to the author 
                            while upholding <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s expectations for quality of bookmaking. This venture provided the foundation

                            for producing and marketing an &#x201c;honest Ruskin&#x201d; edition in the <placeName corresp="#USA">United States</placeName>, although in the end the agreement seems to have led only to suspicion and grievance on both sides 
                            (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MAIDMENTPIRATEDBOOKS"><persName corresp="#BEM">Maidment</persName>, <title corresp="#MAIDMENTPIRATEDBOOKS">&#x201c;John Ruskin, George Allen, and American Pirated Books&#x201d;</title></ref>).</p>

Probably, no prefatory remarks were needed, 
                            since <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02bc;s edition was a new work with an introduction of its own, as opposed to the older works making up

                            It was also hoped that <persName corresp="#CEN">Norton</persName>&#x02bc;s name on the title pages would persuade consummers to justify the price of the edition, compared with the cheap and widely available American piracies.</p>

                                                while the works were in preparation, give to this edition a rare and unique value. The two volumes of poetry written between the ages

                        By the <date notBefore="1890" notAfter="1899">1890s</date>, the privately printed and distributed <date when="1850">1850</date> edition of the <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> had taken on a talismanic aura for rare book collectors, 
                        and <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>inevitably justified the purposes of the <date when="1891">1891</date> edition in part by appealing to the &#x201C;no idle curiosity . . .  that prompts the admirers 
                        of Mr. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s works to collect his boyish writings and to learn the story of his youth&#x201D;. But he also denies playing to this audience, 
                        arguing that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> is &#x201c;misunderstood by the casual reader&#x201d; etc. (v&#x2013;vi).
                    </p>
                    <p>In his editorial rationale, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>, admitted that the poems&#x02BC; &#x201C;author himself has never brought them forward&#x201D;, 
                        it being &#x201C;impossible for him to offer his own juvenile productions as examples of the lofty ideal he preached&#x201D; in his attempt to elevate 
                        &#x201C;the public taste in poetry as well as art&#x201D; (a half truth, since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did occasionally quote from his juvenilia, 
                        with precisely the purpose of showing that they adumbrated his ideals). <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>, however, was determined to shape the corpus 
                        of early writing in favor of the &#x201C;sonorous line and noble thought&#x201D;, the &#x201C;genuine feeling and fine, enthusiastic description&#x201D;. 
                        Without expurgating irony and fun, <persName corresp="#WGC">the editor</persName> felt obliged to present the consistency of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        &#x201C;ways, and aims, and attitude&#x201D;&#x2014;conditions that &#x201C;in his case, more than with&#x201D; other writers, were &#x201C;determined at an early age, 
                        and illustrated in his early writings. That is the recurrent burden of his autobiography:&#x2014;&#x2018;I find in myself nothing whatsoever <hi rend="italic">changed</hi>&#x2019;&#x201D;

                        probably reflects in its title the accurate relation of the &#x201c;Note&#x201d; to the remainder of the edition. As a &#x201c;preliminary&#x201d; effort, the descriptive bibliography dates at least in part to <date when="1889">1889</date> or earlier, 
                        on the evidence of the binding history of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title>. In the &#x201c;Note&#x201d;, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> describes <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title> as &#x201c;an envelope containing loose papers&#x201d;,
                        whereas in its present state this manuscript is bound in several volumes. These bindings originated in <date when="1889">1889</date> at the latest, although the physical and documentary evidence is obscured and somewhat muddled 
                        <!-- ref tag?-->(<ref type="apparatus" target="msxi_apparatus.php#DESCRIPTION">see MS XI: Description</ref>). Thus, while <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> apparently failed to revise his &#x201c;Note&#x201d; to reflect ongoing efforts respecting the manuscripts&#x02bc; preservation and provenance&#x2014;efforts that may 
                        have been beyond his ken (<!-- ref tag?-->see Provenance of Early Manuscripts at Denmark Hill and Brantwood)&#x2014;the &#x201c;Note&#x201d; does record a &#x201c;preliminary&#x201d; stage of the editorial project. And this makes sense, 
                        as the note&#x02bc;s stated purpose is to justify the chronology that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> used to arrange the edition: &#x201c;After some study of these ancient Codices, . . . the Editor has been able to disentangle their contents 
                        and to arrange them in chronological order; which it may be worth while to note here, both for the assistance of future students, and in jusification of the hypothetical dates assigned to some of the poems&#x201d;

                        that <persName corresp="#TJW">Wise</persName> could forge in the form of &#x201C;rare&#x201D; pamphlets (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENWISERUSKINI"><persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName>, &#x201C;<title type="essay" corresp="#DEARDENWISERUSKINI">Wise and Ruskin I</title>&#x201D;</ref>, 46&#x2013;47;
