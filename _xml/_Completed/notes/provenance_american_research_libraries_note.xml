                <head type="title">Ruskin Manuscript Collecting by American Research Libraries</head>
                <p>Since the largest holdings of early <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts ended up the <placeName corresp="#USA">United States</placeName>, 
                    this note discusses institutional factors that may have influenced collecting of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                    in general, and of the early <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in particular, by American research and university libraries.</p>
                
                <p>An indirect factor was the influence of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s ideas over the architecture of American university campuses. 
                    The built environment reflected American aspirations about higher education and evolving ideas about the place of the library in campus life. 
                    While these aspirations did not necessarily favor collecting <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> over other canonical writers, 
                    some special impetus may have arisen from interest in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s educational as well as aesthetic ideals. 
                    Another, less exalted factor among Ivy League university libraries was competition, 
                    with <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName> envying <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>&#x02bc;s larger and more impressive holdings, 
                    and both institutions eyeing the vast resources at <orgName corresp="#HARVARD">Harvard</orgName>. 
                    As the first issue of the newsletter of the <orgName corresp="#FPUL">Friends of Princeton University Library</orgName> pointedly reminded its readers in <date when="1930">1930</date>, 
                    <orgName corresp="#HARVARDLIBRARY">Harvard University Library</orgName> was &#x201c;vigorously furthering her effort to improve what . . . 
                    ranked already as fifth in order of size among the world&#x02bc;s collections of books&#x201d; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PAREDITORIALFPUL"><persName corresp="#PAR">Rollins</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#PAREDITORIALFPUL">editorial</title></ref>, 1). 
                    Rivalry was specifically invoked as justification for <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName>&#x02bc;s first major acquisistion of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#THORPRUSKINMANUSCRIPTS"><persName corresp="#WT">Thorp</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#THORPRUSKINMANUSCRIPTS">&#x201c;The Ruskin Manuscripts&#x201d;</title></ref>, 2).</p>
                
                <p>Rare&#x2010;book departments of university libraries absorbed the tastes and interests of their individual 
                    donors. The generation of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collectors in America represented by 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="adam_r_b_note.php"><persName corresp="#RBA">R. B. Adam II (<date notBefore="1863" notAfter="1940">1863&#x2013;1940</date>)</persName></ref>,

                    was guided by the phenomenon of <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.php">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</ref>. 
                    In following this trend, collectors aspired to acquire every printed item in its original published state that was produced by the modern author of the collector&#x02bc;s choice&#x2014;a comprehensive collection from juvenilia to last words. 
                    Thus, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collectors searched for the author&#x02bc;s poems as first published in the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">annuals</ref>, 
                    and especially as collected in the prized <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1850_note.php"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1850)</ref>. Some collectors were also able to extend their comprehensive print collections 
                    with various states of manuscript production such as marked proofs and touched engravings, as well as with letters and drawings. 
                    Juvenile manuscripts were inaccessible to collectors, however, until the opportunity to enhance the scope of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscript and graphic holdings was exponentially raised by the estate dispersal sales in <date notBefore="1930" notAfter="1931">1930&#x2013;31</date>, with the

                    The chief American buyer at these sales was the <placeName corresp="#BOSTON">Boston</placeName> rare&#x2010;book dealer, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="goodspeed_charles_note.php"><persName corresp="#CG">Charles E. Goodspeed</persName></ref>, 
                    who sold in turn to <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale University Library</orgName> and to <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Princeton University Library</orgName>.</p>
                
                <p><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> meanwhile had built his personal collection of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>. 
                    The collection was primarily print, &#x201c;its scope . . . enlarged to include all the authorized editions of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and his biographies&#x201d; 
                    comprising &#x201c;more than five hundred volumes&#x201d;, but also including drawings, letters, and other materials. <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> donated the collection to <orgName corresp="#WELLESLEYC">Wellesley College</orgName> in <date notBefore="1920" notAfter="1921">1920&#x2013;21</date>, 
                    &#x201c;principally in consideration of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s interest in the education of girls&#x201d; 
                    and because his own daughters had graduated from <orgName corresp="#WELLESLEYC">Wellesley</orgName> (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><title type="book" corresp="#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><hi rend="italic">Yankee Bookseller</hi></title></ref>, 265). 
                    <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> continued adding to the collection throughout the <date notBefore="1920" notAfter="1940">1920s through 1940s</date>.</p>

                        <p>At <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale University</orgName> between the World Wars, collecting of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and of much else was driven by

                            who advocated for building the library&#x02bc;s special collections and encouraged their use by graduate students. <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName> generously opened his personal rare book 
                            and manuscript collection to students&#x02bc; use and persuaded his friend and fellow collector 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="adam_r_b_note.php"><persName corresp="#RBA">R. B. Adam II</persName></ref> to do the same. 
                            While <persName corresp="#RBA">Adam</persName>&#x02bc;s collection was devoted primarily to <persName corresp="#SJ">Samuel Johnson</persName> and his circle, he inherited a <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection from his father, which he built 
                            into one of the most comprehensive print collections of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in <placeName corresp="#USA">America</placeName>. <persName corresp="#RBA">Adam</persName> donated his <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection largely intact to <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale University Library</orgName> in <date when="1929">1929</date>. 
                            One year later, <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> took the opportunity to complement <persName corresp="#RBA">Adam</persName>&#x02bc;s bequest with acquisitions from the

                            Through the agency of <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> and perhaps others, the sale afforded <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> 
                            with a range of manuscripts that was representative both of the chronology and diversity of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s career (see 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php#YALE"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1930">1930</date>: <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, the <date when="1930">1930</date> Acquisitions, and <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale University Library</orgName></ref>).</p>
                        
                        <p>In <date when="1930">1930</date>, acquisition of a <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscript collection by <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale Library</orgName> formed a timely complement 
                            not only to the <title type="archive" corresp="#RBARUSKINCOLLECTION">Adam Collection</title> but also to the library&#x02bc;s new home, 
                            the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling Memorial Building</placeName>. Designed in a Gothic Revival style, 
                            the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling</placeName> would inevitably have brought <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s 
                            ideas to mind, though the building was also very modern. The structure wraps a Gothic cathedral&#x2010; and cloister&#x2010;like shell, 
                            which houses the reading and circulation spaces, around a setback skyscraper tower, containing the stacks and technical operations. 
                            In context of this project, a research collection of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was probably considered appropriate, but not vital, 
                            to discussion about architectural style at <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>.</p>
                        
                        <p>The time was past when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s ideas were realized directly in designs for <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>&#x02bc;s campus buildings. 
                            Ruskinian Gothic flourished from <date when="1864">1864</date>, with <persName corresp="#PBW">P. B. Wight</persName>&#x02bc;s (<date notBefore="1838" notAfter="1925">1838&#x2013;1925</date>) design for the Street Fine Arts Building, 
                            through the mid&#x2010;1880s, with <persName corresp="#RSTURGIS">Russell Sturgis</persName>&#x02bc;s (<date notBefore="1836" notAfter="1909">1836&#x2013;1909</date>) work on Battell Chapel and other buildings. 
                            These men were <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> enthusiasts, and their understanding of his architectural and social ideas found supporters among the faculty 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LYNNBUILDINGYALE"><persName corresp="#CLYNN">Lynn</persName>, &#x201c;Building Yale and Razing It from the Civil War to the Great Depression&#x201d;</ref>, 110&#x2013;18). 
                            But by the <date notBefore="1920" notAfter="1939">1920s&#x2013;30s</date>, Victorian thinking about architecture was being displaced by Bauhaus. 
                            Gothic Revival did persist in <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>&#x02bc;s campus development, just as &#x201c;collegiate Gothic&#x201d; thrived on American campuses elsewhere, 
                            and teachers like <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName>, who edited <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, must have directed students to the critic&#x02bc;s theories. Nonetheless, it is questionable 
                            whether <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s ideas retained the force of an ideology for architects of American universities. 
                            According to <persName corresp="#PGOLDBERGER">Paul Goldberger</persName>, the designer of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling Memorial Library</placeName>, 
                            <persName corresp="#JGR">James Gamble Rogers</persName> (<date notBefore="1867" notAfter="1947">1867&#x2013;1947</date>), was not prone to defend either its neo&#x2010;Gothic design or its skyscraper functionality on ideological grounds. 
                            <persName corresp="#JGR">Rogers</persName>&#x02bc;s buildings, <persName corresp="#PGOLDBERGER">Goldberger</persName> believes, did not aspire to &#x201c;the same kind of moral authority 
                            that <persName corresp="#AWNP">[Augustus Welby] Pugin&#x02bc;s</persName> or <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s Gothic possessed in the <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth century</date>&#x201d; 
                            and that <persName corresp="#PBW">Wight</persName>&#x02bc;s and <persName corresp="#RSTURGIS">Sturgis</persName>&#x02bc;s campus buildings had articulated for <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> a half&#x2010;century earlier; <persName corresp="#JGR">Rogers</persName> sought, rather, 
                            &#x201c;to provide pleasure for the eye along with a casual, undemanding association with the past&#x201d; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GOLDBERGERROGERS">&#x201c;James Gamble Rogers and the Shaping of Yale in the Twentieth Century&#x201d;</ref>, 272).</p>
                        
                        <p>At the same time, the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling building</placeName> epitomized what one historian has characterized as the &#x201c;golden age&#x201d; of the American university library (<date notBefore="1890" notAfter="1940">1890&#x2013;1940</date>), 
                            when free&#x2010;standing, architecturally imposing library buildings were erected at the geographical and intellectual heart of the university campus. 
                            Earlier, in the colonial era, college libraries occupied a single room in a multipurpose building; and then in the nineteenth century, 
                            larger colleges such as <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> constructed dedicated library buildings&#x2014;in either neoclassical or (modeled on the English universities) Gothic Revival styles&#x2014;which 
                            sat on the edge of campus and functioned more as glorified book repositories than as circulating libraries. Starting in the late nineteenth century, 
                            with the erection of vast and imposing library buildings, situated at the center of a revised campus plan, a new message was conveyed: 
                            &#x201c;educators considered these structures to be ennobling, uplifting students by providing them with opportunities for cultural improvement, 
                            whether by studying library books or the building that housed the books&#x201d; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GYUREHEARTOFTHEUNIVERSITY"><persName corresp="#DAGYURE">Gyure</persName>, &#x201c;The Heart of the University&#x201d;</ref>, passim and 119). 
                            The architectural rhetoric mixed overwhelming cultural authority with individualistic aspiration and enfranchisement&#x2014;values 
                            that are combined in a challenging and disconcerting fashion in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s lectures about books and reading, <title type="book" corresp="#JRSESAME"><hi rend="italic">Sesame and Lilies</hi></title> (<date when="1865">1865</date>). 
                            During the golden age of American university library building, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s book servied as a universal school prize&#x2014;small presentation volumes, 
                            which were tricked out as decoratively within their means as the ornate buildings to which the prizes were meant to direct the grateful recipient.</p>
                        
                        <p>While <persName corresp="#JGR">James Gamble Rogers</persName> may have been no ideologue according to <persName corresp="#PGOLDBERGER">Goldberger</persName>, 
                            he did contend for maintaining &#x201c;religion, or at least a version of it, at the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> center&#x201d;, according to another architectural historian; 
                            like other campus planners and library architects of his period, <persName corresp="#JGR">Rogers</persName> proposed &#x201c;creating a new kind of sacred space for the modern American university&#x2014;a 
                            cathedral library laden with quasi&#x2010;religious iconography&#x201d;. Not only did the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling</placeName>&#x02bc;s structural plan encase 
                            &#x201c;the functions of a modern library within the shell of a neo&#x2010;Gothic cathedral&#x201d;; the building&#x02bc;s elaborate decoration scheme of Gothic detail 
                            encompassed an extensive iconographic program, which was perceived as important enough to sacrifice 
                            &#x201c;six tiers of book stacks in order to fund more ornament&#x201d; in stone and wood carving, glass and mural painting, and other media

                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s books on architecture were well&#x2010;known primers for reading iconographic programs, although the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling</placeName>&#x02bc;s scheme 
                            appears not to have incoporated a direct homage to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#STERLINGLIBRARY">&#x201c;The Sterling Memorial Library&#x201d;</ref>).</p>

                        <p>As at <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>, the acquisition of a <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection at <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName> marked a period of library expansion.

                            <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Princeton University Library</orgName> with a similarly representative manuscript collection 
                            of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, which was drawn from acquisitions from the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1931_note.php"><date when="1931">1931</date> <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s sale</ref> (see

                            The key figure in securing the collection was <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="thorp_willard_note.php"><persName corresp="#WT">Willard Thorp</persName> (<date notBefore="1899" notAfter="1990">1899&#x2013;1990</date>)</ref>, who, like

                            and was teaching Victorian poetry at the time.</p>
                        
                        <p>For <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName>, however, the cachet of acquiring a <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection 
                            at this juncture was probably even less significant ideologically than it had been for <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>, 
                            since the pressing architectural problems were functional rather than aesthetic. <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName> already possessed a Ruskinian&#x2010;influenced library building, 
                            the <placeName type="building" corresp="#CHANCELLORGREENLIB">Chancellor Green Library</placeName> (<date when="1872">1872</date>), designed in the Venetian polychromatic Gothic style 
                            by <persName corresp="#WAP">William Appleton Potter</persName> (<date notBefore="1842" notAfter="1909">1842&#x2013;1909</date>). The building&#x02bc;s octagonal plan&#x2014;centered on a panopticon&#x2010;like reference desk, 
                            which was encircled by radiating shelves and reading desks&#x2014;was responsive to librarians&#x02bc; thinking of the time, 
                            that services should be &#x201c;tri&#x2010;partitioned&#x201d; into staff services, secure stacks, and patron reading areas. 
                            This facility was rapidly outgrown, so the <placeName type="building" corresp="#CHANCELLORGREENLIB">Chancellor Green</placeName> was extended in <date when="1897">1897</date>, by being joined to the new <placeName type="building" corresp="#PYNELIBRARY">Pyne Library</placeName>&#x2014;a 
                            more practical rectangular building, designed by <persName corresp="#WAP">Potter</persName> in &#x201c;collegiate&#x201d; Tudor Gothic

                        <p>Even the combined <placeName type="building" corresp="#CHANCELLORGREENLIB">Chancellor Green</placeName> and <placeName type="building" corresp="#PYNELIBRARY">Pyne</placeName> buildings soon reached capacity, despite what was regarded as an embarrassingly modest pace of growth, 
                            compared to the mammoth collections held by <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> and <orgName corresp="#HARVARD">Harvard</orgName>. Moreover, the buildings were not designed to accommodate the flexibility and increased usage demanded 
                            by the pedagogical innovations that <persName corresp="WWILSON">Woodrow Wilson</persName> introduced as president of the university in <date when="1905">1905</date>&#x2014;the preceptorial method of instruction&#x2014;and 
                            that were further developed in <date when="1923">1923</date> as the &#x201c;Four&#x2010;Course&#x201d; plan, which stressed independent and wide&#x2010;ranging reading. 
                            In <date when="1930">1930</date>, when <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale Library</orgName> was moving to the new <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling Building</placeName>, <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName> took an important step toward addressing these limitations 
                            by organizing the <orgName corresp="#FPUL">Friends of Princeton University Library</orgName>. While the <orgName corresp="#FPUL">Friends</orgName> organization was at heart devoted more 
                            to amassing a competitive rare books and manuscript collection for the library than to advocating for brick&#x2010;and&#x2010;mortar issues, 
                            they nonetheless gravitated to a natural alliance with the bookish humanities and social sciences faculty, since, as <persName corresp="#JAXTELL">James Axtell</persName> remarks, 
                            they expected their donations to be well cared for and used in an up&#x2010;to&#x2010;date special collections facility, 
                            as opposed to the dank storage and paltry exhibition space allowed by the <placeName type="building" corresp="#PYNELIBRARY">Pyne</placeName>

                        <p>The alignment of these forces is reflected in the funding for the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> purchase from <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, 
                            which was secured &#x201c;almost entirely by means of contributions&#x201d; from the <orgName corresp="#FPUL">Friends</orgName> organization, 
                            faculty in the Department of English and Department of Art, and alumni. Among the contributing English Department faculty
