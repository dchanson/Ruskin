                    The primary buyer at these sales for the American market was the Boston rare book dealer,

                    Another participant stateside in the <date when="1930">1930</date> sale was the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> English Department professor and <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale Library</orgName> keeper of rare books,

                    At <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName>, a key figure in securing several of <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s acquisitions from the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1931_note.php"><date when="1931">1931</date> <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s sale</ref> for the university library was

                <p>At these institutions, collecting <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in general, and the early manuscripts in particular, grew out of earlier trends in private collecting, 
                    which led to donations benefiting the libraries. At <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> between the World Wars, collecting of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and of much else was driven by 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="tinker_c_b_note.php"><persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName></ref>, 
                    who advocated for building the library&#x02bc;s special collections and encouraged their use by graduate students. <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName> generously opened his personal rare book 
                    and manuscript collection to students&#x02bc; use and persuaded his friend and fellow collector 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="adam_r_b_note.php"><persName corresp="#RBA">R. B. Adam II</persName> (<date notBefore="1863" notAfter="1940">1863&#x2013;1940</date>)</ref> to do the same. 
                    <persName corresp="#RBA">Adam</persName>&#x02bc;s collection was devoted primarily to <persName corresp="#SJ">Samuel Johnson</persName> and his circle, but he also inherited a <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection from his father, which he built 
                    into one of the most comprehensive print collections of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in <placeName corresp="#USA">America</placeName>. <persName corresp="#RBA">Adam</persName> donated his <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection largely intact to <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale University Library</orgName> in <date when="1929">1929</date>, 
                    just one year previous to the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> <date when="1930">1930</date> sale</ref>, 
                    in which <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> took the opportunity to complement <persName corresp="#RBA">Adam</persName>&#x02bc;s comprehensive print collection of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                    with a range of manuscripts that was representative both of the chronology and diversity of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s career. 
                    At <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName>, nearly a decade later in <date when="1939">1939</date>, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="thorp_willard_note.php"><persName corresp="#WT">Willard Thorp</persName></ref>, 
                    who like <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName> was a professor in the English Department and an advocate for developing the university library&#x02bc;s special collections, 
                    dealt with <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="goodspeed_charles_note.php"><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName></ref>, 
                    to acquire a similarly representative manuscript collection of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drawn from acquisitions from the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1931_note.php"><date when="1931">1931</date> <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s sale</ref>. 
                    <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> meanwhile had built his personal <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection&#x2014;primarily print, &#x201c;its scope . . . enlarged to include all the authorized editions of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and his biographies&#x201d; 
                    comprising &#x201c;more than five hundred volumes&#x201d;, but also including drawings, letters, and other materials&#x2014;which he donated to <orgName corresp="#WELLESLEYC">Wellesley College</orgName> in <date notBefore="1920" notAfter="1921">1920&#x2013;21</date>, 
                    &#x201c;principally in consideration of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s interest in the education of girls&#x201d; 
                    and because his own daughters had graduated from <orgName corresp="#WELLESLEYC">Wellesley</orgName> (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><title type="book" corresp="#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER">Yankee Bookseller</title></ref>, 265). 
                    <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> continued adding to the collection throughout the <date notBefore="1920" notAfter="1940">1920s through 1940s</date>.</p>
                
                <p>The generation of American collectors represented by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="adam_r_b_note.php"><persName corresp="#RBA">Adam</persName></ref>, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="tinker_c_b_note.php"><persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName></ref>, and <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="goodspeed_charles_note.php"><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName></ref> was guided in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collecting by the phenomenon of 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.html">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</ref>, 
                    which aspired to comprehensive acquisition of every printed item in its original published state produced by the modern author of the collector&#x02bc;s choice, juvenilia to last words. 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collectors mirrored this ambition for comprehensiveness in the author&#x02bc;s print production by seeking complementary holdings of drawings, letters, marked proofs and touched engravings, and other materials. 
                    For private and institutional collectors in <placeName corresp="#USA">America</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>, the opportunity to enhance the scope of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscript and graphic holdings was exponentially raised by the three <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s sales in <date notBefore="1930" notAfter="1931">1930&#x2013;31</date>, 
                    and the final <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName> estate sale in <date when="1931">1931</date>. The bibliographical details concerning those sales and their buyers, especially as related to <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, are described in

                    The present note discusses institutional factors that influenced <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collecting at American libraries and universities, especially architecture. 
                    The motives animating American libraries&#x02bc; acquisition of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscript and rare&#x2010;book collections 
                    were tied to American aspirations about higher education and evolving ideas about the place of the library in campus life, 
                    which probably did not favor collecting <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> over other canonical writers, but which perhaps gave an impetus to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collecting owing to 
                    the influence that his ideas had already exercised over American campus architecture and educational ideals. Another, not insignificant factor 
                    affecting acquisitions by Ivy League university libraries was competition, 
                    with <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName> envying <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>&#x02bc;s larger and more impressive holdings (both in its general and its special collections), and both institutions eyeing the vast resources at <orgName corresp="#HARVARDLIBRARY">Harvard</orgName>, 
                    which, as the first&#x2010;issue newsletter of the <orgName corresp="#FPUL">Friends of Princeton University Library</orgName> prodded its readers in <date when="1930">1930</date>, was &#x201c;vigorously furthering her effort to improve what . . . 
                    ranked already as fifth in order of size among the world&#x02bc;s collections of books&#x201d; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PAREDITORIALFPUL"><persName corresp="#PAR">Rollins</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#PAREDITORIALFPUL">editorial</title></ref>, 1).</p>

                            (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php#YALE"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1930">1930</date>: <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, the <date when="1930">1930</date> Acquisitions, and <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale University Library</orgName></ref>), 
                            it would not have been lost on <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="tinker_c_b_note.php"><persName corresp="#CBT">Chauncey Tinker</persName></ref> that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> materials formed an appropriate acquisition at the time when the <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale Library</orgName> 
                            was moving to the newly completed <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling Memorial Building</placeName>. Architecturally, the structure wraps a Gothic cathedral&#x2010; and cloister&#x2010;like shell, 
                            which houses the reading and circulation spaces, around a setback skyscraper tower, containing the stacks and technical operations. 
                            In context of this project, a research collection of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was perhaps considered appropriate, but not vital, 
                            to discussion about architectural style at <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>.</p>
                        
                        <p>The time was past when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s ideas were realized directly in designs for <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>&#x02bc;s campus buildings. 
                            Ruskinian Gothic flourished from <date when="1864">1864</date>, with P. B. Wight&#x02bc;s (<date notBefore="1838" notAfter="1925">1838&#x2013;1925</date>) design for the Street Fine Arts Building, 
                            through the mid&#x2010;1880s, with Russell Sturgis&#x02bc;s (<date notBefore="1836" notAfter="1909">1836&#x2013;1909</date>) work on Battell Chapel and other buildings. 
                            These men were <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> enthusiasts, and their understanding of his architectural and social ideas found supporters among the faculty 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LYNNBUILDINGYALE"><persName corresp="#CLYNN">Lynn</persName>, &#x201c;Building Yale and Razing It from the Civil War to the Great Depression&#x201d;</ref>, 110&#x2013;18). 
                            But by the <date notBefore="1920" notAfter="1939">1920s&#x2013;30s</date>, Victorian thinking about architecture was being displaced by Bauhaus; 
                            and while Gothic Revival persisted in <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>&#x02bc;s campus development, just as &#x201c;collegiate Gothic&#x201d; thrived on American campuses elsewhere, 
                            which teachers like <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName> and their students must have connected with their readings in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, it is questionable 
                            whether <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s ideas retained the force of an ideology for architects of American universities. 
                            According to <persName corresp="#PGOLDBERGER">Paul Goldberger</persName>, the designer of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling Memorial Library</placeName>, 
                            <persName corresp="#JGR">James Gamble Rogers</persName> (<date notBefore="1867" notAfter="1947">1867&#x2013;1947</date>), was not prone to defend either its neo&#x2010;Gothic design or its skyscraper functionality on ideological grounds. 
                            <persName corresp="#JGR">Rogers</persName>&#x02bc;s buildings, <persName corresp="#PGOLDBERGER">Goldberger</persName> believes, did not aspire to &#x201c;the same kind of moral authority 
                            that <persName corresp="#AWNP">[Augustus Welby] Pugin&#x02bc;s</persName> or <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s Gothic possessed in the <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth century</date>&#x201d; 
                            and that Wight&#x02bc;s and Sturgis&#x02bc;s campus buildings articulated for <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> a half&#x2010;century earlier; <persName corresp="#JGR">Rogers</persName> sought, rather,

                        <p>At the same time, the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling building</placeName> epitomized what one historian has characterized as the &#x201c;golden age&#x201d; of the American university library (<date notBefore="1890" notAfter="1940">1890&#x2013;1940</date>), 
                            when free&#x2010;standing, architecturally imposing library buildings were erected at the geographical and intellectual heart of the university campus. 
                            Earlier, in the colonial era, college libraries occupied a single room in a multipurpose building; and then in the nineteenth century, 
                            larger colleges such as <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> constructed dedicated library buildings&#x2014;in either neoclassical or (modeled on the English universities) Gothic Revival styles&#x2014;which 
                            sat on the edge of campus and functioned more as glorified book repositories than as circulating libraries. Starting in the late nineteenth century, 
                            with the erection of vast and imposing library buildings, situated at the center of a revised campus plan, a new message was conveyed: 
                            &#x201c;educators considered these structures to be ennobling, uplifting students by providing them with opportunities for cultural improvement, 
                            whether by studying library books or the building that housed the books&#x201d; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GYUREHEARTOFTHEUNIVERSITY"><persName corresp="#DAGYURE">Gyure</persName>, &#x201c;The Heart of the University&#x201d;</ref>, passim and 119). 
                            The architectural rhetoric mixed overwhelming cultural authority with individualistic aspiration and enfranchisement&#x2014;values 
                            that are combined in a challenging and disconcerting fashion in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s lectures about books and reading, <title type="book" corresp="#JRSESAME"><hi rend="italic">Sesame and Lilies</hi></title> (<date when="1865">1865</date>). 
                            During the golden age of American university library building, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s book servied as a universal school prize&#x2014;small presentation volumes, 
                            which were tricked out as decoratively within their means as the ornate buildings to which the prizes were meant to direct the grateful recipient.</p>
                        
                        <p>While <persName corresp="#JGR">James Gamble Rogers</persName> may have been no ideologue according to <persName corresp="#PGOLDBERGER">Goldberger</persName>, 
                            he did contend for maintaining &#x201c;religion, or at least a version of it, at the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> center&#x201d;, according to another architectural historian; 
                            like other campus planners and library architects of his period, <persName corresp="#JGR">Rogers</persName> proposed &#x201c;creating a new kind of sacred space for the modern American university&#x2014;a 
                            cathedral library laden with quasi&#x2010;religious iconography&#x201d;. Not only did the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling</placeName>&#x02bc;s structural plan encase 
                            &#x201c;the functions of a modern library within the shell of a neo&#x2010;Gothic cathedral&#x201d;; the building&#x02bc;s elaborate decoration scheme of Gothic detail 
                            encompassed an extensive iconographic program, which was perceived as important enough to sacrifice 
                            &#x201c;six tiers of book stacks in order to fund more ornament&#x201d; in stone and wood carving, glass and mural painting, and other media

                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s books on architecture were well&#x2010;known primers for reading iconographic programs, although the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling</placeName>&#x02bc;s scheme 
                            appears not to have incoporated a direct homage to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#STERLINGLIBRARY">&#x201c;The Sterling Memorial Library&#x201d;</ref>).</p>

                        <p>As at <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>, the acquisition of a <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection at <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName> marked a period of library expansion (see 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1931_note.php#PRINCETON"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1931">1931</date>: <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> and <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Princeton University Library</orgName></ref>. 
                            However, the chachet of acquiring a <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection at this juncture was probably less significant for <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName> than for <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> 
                            since the pressing architectural problems were functional rather than aesthetic. <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName> already possessed a Ruskinian&#x2010;influenced library building, 
                            the Chancellor Green Library (<date when="1872">1872</date>), designed in the Venetian polychromatic Gothic style 
                            by William Appleton Potter (<date notBefore="1842" notAfter="1909">1842&#x2013;1909</date>). The building&#x02bc;s octagonal plan&#x2014;centered on a panopticon&#x2010;like reference desk, 
                            which was encircled by radiating shelves and reading desks&#x2014;was responsive to librarians&#x02bc; thinking of the time, 
                            that services should be &#x201c;tri&#x2010;partitioned&#x201d; into staff services, secure stacks, and patron reading areas. 
                            This facility was rapidly outgrown, so the Chancellor Green was extended in <date when="1897">1897</date>, by being joined to the new Pyne Librry&#x2014;a 
                            more practical rectangular building, designed by Potter in &#x201c;collegiate&#x201d; Tudor Gothic

                        <p>Even the combined Chancellor Green and Pyne buildings soon reached capacity, despite what was regarded as an embarrassingly modest pace of growth, 
                            compared to the mammoth collections held by <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> and <orgName corresp="#HARVARDLIBRARY">Harvard</orgName>. Moreover, the buildings were not designed to accommodate the flexibility and increased usage demanded 
                            by the pedagogical innovations that <persName corresp="WWILSON">Woodrow Wilson</persName> introduced as president of the university in <date when="1905">1905</date>&#x2014;the preceptorial method of instruction&#x2014;and 
                            that were further developed in <date when="1923">1923</date> as the &#x201c;Four&#x2010;Course&#x201d; plan, which stressed independent and wide&#x2010;ranging reading. 
                            In <date when="1930">1930</date>, when <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale Library</orgName> was moving to the new <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling Building</placeName>, <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName> took an important step toward addressing these limitations 
                            by organizing the <orgName corresp="#FPUL">Friends of Princeton University Library</orgName>. While the <orgName corresp="#FPUL">Friends</orgName> organization was at heart devoted more 
                            to amassing a competitive rare books and manuscript collection for the library than to advocating for brick&#x2010;and&#x2010;mortar issues, 
                            they nonetheless gravitated to a natural alliance with the bookish humanities and social sciences faculty, since, as <persName corresp="#JAXTELL">James Axtell</persName> remarks, 
                            they expected their donations to be well cared for and used in an up&#x2010;to&#x2010;date special collections facility, 
                            as opposed to the dank storage and paltry exhibition space allowed by the Pyne 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#AXTELLMAKINGOFPUL"><persName corresp="#JAXTELL">Axtell</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#AXTELLMAKINGOFPUL">&#x201C;The Making of the Princeton University Library&#x201D;</title></ref>, 507&#x2013;10, 513, 521&#x2013;23).</p>
                        
                        <p>The alignment of these forces is reflected in the funding for the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> purchase from <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, 
                            which was secured &#x201c;almost entirely by means of contributions&#x201d; from the <orgName corresp="#FPUL">Friends</orgName> organization, 
                            faculty in the Department of English and Department of Art, and alumni. Among the contributing English Department faculty 
                            were <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="thorp_willard_note.php"><persName corresp="#WT">Willard Thorp</persName></ref>&#x2014;well&#x2010;known
