                <p><persName corresp="#CG">Charles Eliot Goodspeed</persName> was significant both as a personal collector of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and as a seller to other <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collectors, 
                    operating from his shop in <placeName corresp="#BOSTON">Boston, Massachusetts</placeName>, first opened in <date when="1898">1898</date> (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WHITEHILLGOODSPEED"><persName corresp="WMWHITEHILL">Whitehill</persName>, <title type="dictionary_entry" corresp="#WHITEHILLGOODSPEED">&#x201c;Charles Eliot Goodspeed&#x201d;</title></ref>, 261). 
                    In his memoir, <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><title type="book" corresp="#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><hi rend="italic">Yankee Bookseller</hi></title></ref> (<date when="1937">1937</date>), <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> dates his <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collecting from his youth in the <date notBefore="1880" notAfter="1889">1880s</date>, 
                    giving two reasons for &#x201c;the spell of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x201d;. First, his books occupied, &#x201c;if not the highest, at least high rank in modern English literature&#x201d;, 
                    for &#x201c;although his style is criticised&#x201d;, he &#x201c;is conceded to be a great prose writer&#x201d;. Second, for collectors, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s books presented outstanding 
                    &#x201c;examples of book&#x2010;making&#x201d;, excelling &#x201c;principally in illustration&#x201d; but also in the &#x201c;minute attention&#x201d; that the author gave to all aspects 
                    of book&#x2010;making in such works as &#x201c;<title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRDEUCALION"><hi rend="italic">Deucalion</hi></title>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRPROSERPINA"><hi rend="italic">Proserpina</hi></title>, and the other books issued [originally] in parts&#x201d; (pp. 263, 264). 
                    It was perhaps the bibliophile&#x02bc;s enchantment with the illustrations in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s books that caused <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> to take a special interest in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s own drawings.</p>
                
                <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s standard for &#x201c;book&#x2010;making&#x201d; inspired <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> also as a publisher. In the <date when="1939">1939</date> edition of 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LEHMANNHAUPTBOOKINAMERICA"><title type="book" corresp="#LEHMANNHAUPTBOOKINAMERICA"><hi rend="italic">The Book in America</hi></title></ref>, 
                    <persName corresp="#HLH">Hellmut Lehmann&#x2010;Haupt</persName> characterized <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> as &#x201c;a disciple of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, and moved by many interests which he shared with the <orgName corresp="#STONEKIMBALL">Stone and Kimball</orgName> generation&#x201d; (p. 254), 
                    referring to the small art&#x2010;nouveau publishers of the <date notBefore="1890" notAfter="1899">1890s</date>, such as <orgName corresp="#STONEKIMBALL">Stone &#x0026; Kimball</orgName> in <placeName corresp="#CHICAGO">Chicago</placeName> and 
                    <orgName corresp="#COPELANDDAY">Copeland &#x0026; Day</orgName> in <placeName corresp="#BOSTON">Boston</placeName>. These publishers, according to <persName corresp="#HLH">Lehmann&#x2010;Haupt</persName>, &#x201c;had in common their determination 
                    to publish only works of literary quality and to bring out their selections in an attractive and distinctive format&#x201d; (p. 211). 
                    From the founding of his bookselling business through the early <date notBefore="1930" notAfter="1935">1930s</date>, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> realized these art&#x2010;book ambitions in small publishing projects of his own, 
                    which were printed by the <orgName corresp="#MERRYMOUNTPRESS">Merrymount Press</orgName> (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MAHONEYGOODSPEED"><persName corresp="#MMAHONEY">Mahoney</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#MAHONEYGOODSPEED">&#x201c;C. E. Goodspeed and Company&#x201d;</title></ref>, 180).</p>
                
                <p>The spell of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> for <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> was not confined to bibliographical appeal, however. <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> was a thorough and admiring student of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s ideas, 
                    as demonstrated by the scholarship he brought to a not insignificant bibliographical contribution to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> studies in the <date notBefore="1930" notAfter="1939">1930s</date>, his 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GOODSPEEDCAT"><title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCAT"><hi rend="italic">Catalogue of Paintings, Drawings, and Manuscripts by John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, 
                    published by <orgName corresp="#GOODSPEEDSBOOKSHOP">Goodspeed&#x02BC;s Book Shop</orgName> 
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1931_note.php#BUYERS"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1931">1931</date>: The Buyers</ref>). 
                    <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s approach to thinking through <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears to have been primarily biographical. 
                    His most cherished collector&#x02bc;s possession was the manuscript of <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>; 
                    and according to a record of a talk he gave at <orgName corresp="#WELLESLEYC">Wellesley College</orgName> Library in <date when="1933">1933</date>, 
                    he chose to interest his listeners in &#x201c;<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s youth&#x201d; and &#x201c;his love in later life for <persName corresp="#RLT">Rose La Touche</persName>&#x201d;, 
                    illustrating the talk with &#x201c;his own collection of early <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drawings and other material illustrative of his life&#x201d;, 
                    including <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s portrait drawing of <persName corresp="#RLT">Rose La Touche</persName>, and one of <persName corresp="#GR">George Richmond</persName>&#x02bc;s portrait drawings of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>

                    In <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><title type="book" corresp="#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><hi rend="italic">Yankee Bookseller</hi></title></ref>, he planned to devote part of the chapter on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to &#x201c;the story of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and <persName corresp="#RLT">Rose La Touche</persName>, prefaced by an account of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s 
                    marriage with <persName corresp="#ECG">Euphemia Gray</persName>&#x201d;, ultimately deciding to save the topic for treatment elsewhere (p. 268).</p>
                
                <p><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> also took a practical interest in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>. Judging by <persName corresp="#WMWHITEHILL">Walter Muir Whitehill</persName>&#x02bc;s remarks about the hobbies that the bookseller pursued in his retirement years, 
                    <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s interests appear to have been inspired by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s works, such as tending to rare, wild plant species in his woodland garden 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WHITEHILLGOODSPEED"><title type="dictionary_entry" corresp="#WHITEHILLGOODSPEED">&#x201c;Charles Eliot Goodspeed&#x201d;</title></ref>, 361). His most regretted loss at the final <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName> estate sale in <date when="1931-07">July 1931</date> was <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s 
                    mineral cabinet, an &#x201c;item [that] excited me greatly, for it revived my early interest in mineralogical specimens, never entirely lost&#x201d;

                    <p>As one of most prominent <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collectors stateside in the first half of the twentieth century, 
                        <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> exhibited characteristics of the trend for 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.php">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</ref>, 
                        which committed collectors to assembling comprehensive runs of an author&#x02bc;s first editions in their original condition. 
                        In his memoir, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> comments on his &#x201c;mistake&#x201d; as a young collector in causing his fledgling <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection to be uniformly rebound, 
                        instead of preserving the items in their original state. He therefore disposed of that false start and rebuilt his <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection 
                        on &#x201c;the primary rule that pamphlet issues of all kinds, if intended for sale to collectors, 
                        must be preserved in their original form&#x201d;. Eventually, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection reached over five hundred items 
                        of first editions along with &#x201c;all the authorized editions of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and his biographies&#x201d; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><title type="book" corresp="#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><hi rend="italic">Yankee Bookseller</hi></title></ref>, 261&#x2013;62, 265). 
                        The volume count is comparable in scope with a contemporaneous comprehensive <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection assembled by the American collector, 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="adam_r_b_note.php"><persName corresp="#RBA">R. B. Adam II</persName> (<date notBefore="1863" notAfter="1940">1863&#x2013;1940</date>)</ref> 
                        and his father by adoption, <persName corresp="#RBAI">Robert Borthwick Adam I</persName> (<date notBefore="1833" notAfter="1904">1833&#x2013;1904</date>).</p>
                    
                    <p>As a bookseller, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> held to the standard of &#x201c;<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> firsts&#x201d;, just as he had done as a collector; 
                        and he believed he &#x201c;bought more&#x201d; of these editions &#x201c;abroad than any other American dealer&#x201d;. As a <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> specialist, 
                        he distinguished his shop from the &#x201c;larger booksellers&#x201d;, who could be counted on to stock 
                        &#x201c;the nine&#x2010;volume set comprising <title type="book" corresp="#JRMODERNPAINTERS"><hi rend="italic">Modern Painters</hi></title>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRSEVENLAMPS"><hi rend="italic">The Seven Lamps of Architecture</hi></title>, and <title type="book" corresp="#JRSTONESOFVENICE"><hi rend="italic">The Stones of Venice</hi></title>&#x201d; 
                        in a uniform size with illustrations&#x2014;the latter caveats obscuring what the initiated <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collector would have recognized, 
                        that these sets were made up with later editions of <title type="book" corresp="#JRMODERNPAINTERS1"><hi rend="italic">Modern Painters I</hi></title> and <title type="book" corresp="#JRMODERNPAINTERS2"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="italic">Modern Painters II</hi></hi></title> rather than the first editions of those two volumes, 
                        not so much because the firsts were a different size than the other volumes (and in the case of <title type="book" corresp="#JRMODERNPAINTERS1"><hi rend="italic">Modern Painters I</hi></title>, lacked illustrations), but because the first editions of those two volumes were extremely rare. 
                        Scouring <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> firsts, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> says that, other than the prized <title type="book" corresp="#JRMODERNPAINTERS1"><hi rend="italic">Modern Painters</hi> I</title> and <title type="book" corresp="#JRMODERNPAINTERS2">II</title> and

                        he &#x201c;found no competition&#x201d; for first editions of lesser&#x2010;known <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> titles&#x2014;namely, the dozens of books and pamphlets beyond the titles making up the standard 
                        nine&#x2010;volume sets always available &#x201c;on the shelves of the larger booksellers&#x201c; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><title type="book" corresp="#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><hi rend="italic">Yankee Bookseller</hi></title></ref>, 262&#x2013;63).</p>
                   
                    <p><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> credited the influence of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s American friend and <orgName corresp="#HARVARD">Harvard</orgName> professor of the history of art,

                        for the &#x201c;mild local interest in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> then prevalent&#x201d; in the first third of the twentieth century, 
                        and he believed his own &#x201c;earnestness&#x201d; contributed to upholding the &#x201c;fading <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> tradition&#x201d; at least in New England. 
                        (He hoped that the chapter on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in his memoir would &#x201c;arouse a new interest in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, at least with collectors&#x201d;, 
                        when the author had become so &#x201c;strangely neglected today&#x201d;). While he knew the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collector <persName corresp="#RBA">R. B. Adam</persName> only by reputation, not as a client, 
                        <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> supplied other important American collectors, including

                        not only for print but also for manuscripts. His knowledge about the full scope of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s writing and bibliography

                    <p>As a <placeName corresp="#BOSTON">Boston</placeName> dealer, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> was well positioned to acquire <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> rarities connected with the region&#x2014;for example, 
                        acquisitions from the estate of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s friend, <persName corresp="#FALEXANDER">Francesca Alexander</persName>, which he gave to <orgName corresp="#WELLESLEYC">Wellesley</orgName>. 
                        The thoughtful variety and scope of his collection when donated to <orgName corresp="#WELLESLEYC">Wellesley</orgName> shows, however, that he had long searched beyond the antiquarian book trade 
                        to build up his holdings. His most significant opportunity to contibute stateside to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> archives came in <date notBefore="1930" notAfter="1931">1930&#x2013;31</date>, 
                        when he played a highly competitive role in the

                    <p><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s strategy as a buyer at these sales of manuscripts and drawings appears to have corresponded to his approach as a dealer 
                        in printed <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> items&#x2014;that is, to seize on what was then considered less canonical <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, 
                        an area in which competition could be expected to be less keen. (His agent at the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> sales, the <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> firm, <orgName corresp="#BFSTEVENSBROWN">B. F. Stevens &#x0026; Brown</orgName>, 
                        felt able to assure their other major <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> client, <persName corresp="#JHW">J. H. Whitehouse</persName>, that the firm could work with mutual advantage for both <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> and <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName>. 
                        See <title type="letter" corresp="#b_f_stevens_to_j_h_whitehouse_1931-07-17"><persName corresp="#RBROWN">Ralph Brown</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1931-07-17">17 July 1931</date> letter to <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName></title>, quoted in

                        It seems likely, however, that, although avoiding squaring off against competitors like <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName> who targeted the more canonical 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> took on considerable risk. Not only had the Great Depression begun in <placeName corresp="#USA">America</placeName>, 
                        but, even before the crash, interest in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was declining, as <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> later admitted in <title type="book" corresp="#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><hi rend="italic">Yankee Bookseller</hi></title>. 
                        The decline was evident by <date when="1929">1929</date> even before <date when="1929-10-29">Black Tuesday</date>, since by that date <persName corresp="#RBA">R. B.

                        after having unsuccessfully attempted for the previous six years to sell the collection through the major <placeName corresp="#NEWYORK">New York</placeName> dealer, <persName corresp="#ASWR">A. S. W. Rosenbach</persName>

                        which must have entailed a significant expense in itself. One recipient of the catalogue in 1932<!-- CHECK --> was <persName corresp="#JHW">J. H. Whitehouse</persName>, 
                        whom <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> hoped to interest especially in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drawings, though <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName>

                        must have been prompted by the slowing sales of his <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s acquisitions. Not until <date when="1939">1939</date> were many of the items in <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s

                        Salvaging viable remains of books and manuscripts from the catastrophe, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> donated

                        that I have most regard. I had bought . . . [the autobiography] when published in periodical form, looking forward to each succeeding number
