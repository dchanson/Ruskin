                    presents the <persName corresp="#EA">Reverend Andrews</persName> as combining evangelical seriousness with a robust appreciation of the arts. 
                    Descended from a learned and sophisticated <geogName corresp="#ESSEX">Essex</geogName> family, he followed his father and grandfather into the Nonconformist clergy, 
                    studying at <orgName corresp="#HOXTONACAD">Hoxton Theological College</orgName>, and then at <orgName corresp="#GLASGOWUNIV">Glasgow University</orgName> (the latter a Scottish connection 
                    that perhaps recommended him to the Ruskins&#x20BC; favor)

                    According to <persName corresp="#EPH">Edwin Paxton Hood</persName> (<date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1885">1820&#x2010;85</date>), a <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregational</orgName> minister and a prolific writer about the preaching of his time, 
                    <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> maintained that &#x201C;God . . . should be worshipped with the best of everything . . . best architecture, best painting, 
                    best music, best sculpture, best poetry, and best genius&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HOODVOCATIONPREACHER">Hood, <hi rend="italic">Vocation of the Preacher</hi></ref>, 209).</p>
                 <p><persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> entered the <orgName corresp= "#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalist</orgName> <orgName corresp="#HOXTONACAD">Hoxton Academy</orgName> in <date when="1808">1808</date>. 
                     Founded in <date when="1778">1778</date>, <orgName corresp="#HOXTONACAD">Hoxton</orgName> was at this time a growing and important academy, 
                    accommodating thirty to forty students in residence (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GLENLAUNCHINGCLERICALCAREER">Glen, &#x201C;Launching a Clerical Career in Late Georgian <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>&#x201D;</ref>, 645). 
                    The principal, a Scottish divine, <persName corresp="#RSREV">Robert Simpson</persName> (1746&#x2013;1817), did not have the reputation of a scholar, 
                     and candidates were chosen primarily for their &#x201C;good natural abilities,&#x201D; zeal, and commitment to evangelical doctrine 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#NUTTALLTRAININGHOXTON">Nuttall, &#x201C;Training for Hoxton and Highbury&#x201D;</ref>, 477;

                     Nonetheless, by the time of <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s matriculation, the <orgName corresp="#HOXTONACAD">Academy</orgName> was observing higher standards of learning, 
                    including securing scholarships to <orgName corresp="#GLASGOWUNIV">Glasgow University</orgName>. An <date when="1810">1810</date> syllabus shows that available studies included the following subjects, 
                     divided among three tutors: &#x201C;Hebrew and biblical criticism, Jewish antiquities, 
                    evidences of divine revelation, systematic divinity, ecclesiastical history, and its connexion with profane [especially Roman] history; . . . 
                    English grammar, geography, Latin (including prose composition) and Greek; . . . pneumatology, logic, and belles lettres, 
                    with special regard to pulpit composition and elocution.&#x201D; Students who, like <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>, proceeded to <orgName corresp="#GLASGOWUNIV">Glasgow University</orgName> fell under 
                     the supervision of <persName corresp="#GEREV">Greville Ewing</persName> (1767&#x2013;1841), a <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregational</orgName> minister and a tutor at the <orgName corresp="#GLASGOWTHEOACAD">Glasgow Theological Academy</orgName>
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#THOMPSONHOXTON">Thompson, &#x201C;Hoxton [Independent] Academy (1791&#x2013;1826) and Highbury College (1826&#x2013;1850)&#x201D;</ref>).</p>
                <p>The Ruskins began hearing <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> preach in the parish of <placeName corresp="#WALWORTH">Walworth</placeName>, which was a village lying only a few miles south of 
                    <placeName corresp="#LONDONBRDG">London Bridge</placeName>. Like <ref type="note" subtype="geographical" target="camberwell_note.php"><placeName corresp="#CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</placeName></ref>, a little farther to the south 
                    where the Ruskins lived, <placeName corresp="#WALWORTH">Walworth</placeName> was a rapidly growing suburb but still on the edge of the open country and woods around <placeName corresp="#NORWOOD">Norwood</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#DULWICH">Dulwich</placeName>. 
                    The Andrewses&#x02BC; household resembled the Ruskins&#x02BC; with its growing collection of pictures on the walls, a substantial library on the shelves, and gardens outside, 
                    but it would have been a much busier and noisier place than <ref type="note" subtype="geographical" target="herne_hill_note.php"><placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName></ref>. 
                    By the beginning of <date when="1831">1831</date>, the manse had seventeen inhabitants, including <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> and his wife, 
                    <persName corresp="#EHSA">Elizabeth (n&#x00E9;e Elizabeth Honor Symons)</persName>, who was learned and fond of music like her husband; twelve children 
                    (by <date when="1831-06">June 1831</date>, two would die in infancy); three servants; and a few penurious clergymen dependent on the Andrews family&#x02BC;s charity. 
                    In addition, a constant flow of visitors was drawn to the house 
                    by the family&#x02BC;s sociability and parish responsibilities 
                    (<ref type="bibiography" target="bibliography.php#ANSTRUTHERCOVENTRYPATMORESANGEL"><hi rend="italic">Coventry Patmore&#x02BC;s Angel</hi></ref>, 13, 19).</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> officiated in his own chapel in <placeName corresp="#WALKWORTH">Walworth</placeName>, <placeName type="building" corresp="#BERESFORDSTREETCHAPEL">Beresford Street Chapel</placeName>, which adjoined his house. 
                    He was at first a candidate for <placeName type="building" corresp="#CAMDENCHAPEL">Camden Chapel</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#WALKWORTH">Camberwell</placeName>, 
                    where he stirred such excitement that the congregation demanded him for their pastor. Blocked by their trustees, 
                    some members of the congregation broke away and built the <placeName type="building" corresp="#WALWORTHCHAPEL">Walworth Chapel</placeName> for him, financed to some extent by <persName corresp ="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s wealthy father&#x2010;in&#x2010;law 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CLEALSTORYCONGREGATIONALISM">Cleal, <hi rend="italic">The Story of Congregationalism in Surrey</hi></ref>, 105;

                    Such generous arrangements were not unheard&#x2010;of among the most popular preachers&#x2014;especially those whose congregations included wealthy members&#x2014;the 
                    largest of such complexes being <placeName type="building" corresp="#SURREYCHAPEL">Surrey Chapel</placeName>, built to accommodate audiences of 3,000 for the preaching 
                    of <persName corresp="#RHREV">Rowland Hill</persName> (1744&#x2013;1833) in <placeName corresp="#BLACKFRIARS">Blackfriars</placeName>, London 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GLENLAUNCHINGCLERICALCAREER">Glen, &#x201C;Launching a Clerical Career in Late Georgian England&#x201D;</ref>, 649; 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HILLDNB">Munden, &#x201C;Hill, Rowland (1744&#x2013;1833)&#x201D;</ref>). The crowds pressing to hear <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>  
                    soon grew too large for the <placeName type="building" corresp="#BERESFORDCHAPEL">Beresford Street Chapel</placeName>, and <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> decided to finance an expansion with the aid of a new mortgage, which ultimately proved a ruinous 
                    encumberment (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CLEALSTORYCONGREGATIONALISM">Cleal, <hi rend="italic">The Story of Congregationalism in Surrey</hi></ref>, 105). 
                    In his glory days, <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> attracted crowds larger than could gain seating even in the expanded structure accommodating 1,600 seats 
                    (<ref type="bibiography" target="bibliography.php#ANSTRUTHERCOVENTRYPATMORESANGEL"><hi rend="italic">Coventry Patmore&#x02BC;s Angel</hi></ref>, 22&#x2013;23).</p>
                <p>In <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> remembered the chapel as an example of 
                    &#x201C;the Londonian chapel in its perfect type, definable as accurately as a Roman basilica,&#x2014;an oblong, flat&#x2010;ceiled barn, 
                    lighted by windows with semi&#x2010;circular heads, brick&#x2010;arched, filled by small&#x2010;paned glass held by iron bars, like fine threaded halves of cobwebs; galleries propped 
                    on iron pipes, up both side; pews, well shut in, each of them, by partitions of plain deal, and neatly brass&#x2010;latched deal doors, filling the barn floor, 
                    all but its two lateral straw&#x2010;matted passages; pulpit, sublimely isolated, central from sides and clear of altar rails at end; a stout, four&#x2010;legged box 
                    of well&#x2010;grained wainscot, high as the level of front galleries, and decorated with a cushion of crimson velvet, padded six inches thick, with gold tassels at the corners, 
                    which was a great resource to me when I was tired of the sermon, because I liked watching the rich colour of the folds and creases that came in it when the clergyman thumped it.&#x201D; 
                    Like his representation in the autobiography of the toyless austerity of his boyhood, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> exaggerated this description, here in order to make the point that his 
                    &#x201C;well&#x2010;formed habit [in youth] of narrowing myself to happiness within . . . four brick walls&#x201D; supported his &#x201C;acute perception and deep feeling of the beauty of architecture 
                    and scenery abroad&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 35:132); and see

                    that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x20BC;s prose picture captures accurately enough the &#x201C;perfect type&#x201D; of the late&#x2010;Georgian meeting house, 
                    <persName corresp="#EPH">Hood</persName> remembered that the building&#x02BC;s unusually rich adornments &#x201C;gave you certainly no idea of the dissenting conventicle.&#x201D; 
                    There were &#x201C;stained glass, and the <persName corresp="#AARON">Aaronic</persName> and <persName corresp="#MOSES">Mosaic</persName> figures, 
                    the <persName corresp="STJOHNTHEBAPTIST">Baptist</persName> and <persName corresp="#STPAUL">St. Paul</persName> in carving&#x2014;the rich, loud organ, and the altar&#x2010;piece&#x201D;&#x2014;the 
                    grander fittings perhaps features of the heavily mortgaged expansion, and &#x201C;far beyond what was usual in Nonconformist buildings of that period&#x201D;

                <p>The organ, which members of the Andrews family played, was a particularly vital resource for recitalists contributing musical culture in the locale. 
                    <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> himself was proficient on several instruments, and his accomplishments extended to other arts, as well 
                    (<ref type="bibiography" target="bibliography.php#ANSTRUTHERCOVENTRYPATMORESANGEL"><hi rend="italic">Coventry Patmore&#x20BC;s Angel</hi></ref>, 18). 
                    He had some success as a sacred dramatist, with titles including <title type="drama" corresp="#ANDREWSVINEYARDNABOTH"><hi rend="italic">The Vineyard of Naboth: A Dramatic Fragment</hi></title> 
                    (&#x201C;translated from the original Hebrew(&#x201D;), which was printed in <date when="1825">1825</date>. Another title, <title type="drama" corresp="#ANDREWSSAMPSON"><hi rend="italic">Sampson</hi></title>,

                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HOODVOCATIONPREACHER"><hi rend="italic">Vocation of the Preacher</hi></ref>, 212, 231). 
                    Of <persName corresp="#EA">Andrew</persName>s&#x02BC;s varied pursuits&#x2014;many of which were self&#x2010;financed, like his chapel&#x2014;a crucial one for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was the role of editor. As proprietor and editor of the

                    by printing versions of the youth&#x02BC;s poem, <ref type="apparatus" target="on_skiddaw_and_derwentwater_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwentwater&#x201D;</title></ref>

                <p>In preaching, the method recommended by <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s principal at <orgName corresp="#HOXTONACAD">Hoxton</orgName>, <persName corresp="#RSIMP">Robert Simpson</persName> , was to commit written sermons to memory in order to enjoy more &#x201C;liberty in the pulpit,&#x201D; 
                    and thereby cultivate the &#x201C;new style&#x201D; of sermonizing by <orgName corresp="#DISSENTERS">evangelical Dissenters</orgName> , which pursued passion and drama and at least the impression of extempore inspiration

                    This method seems to account for <persName corresp="#EPH">Hood</persName>&#x02BC;s anecdotes about <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;eccentricities,&#x201D; such as his pausing in the middle of a sermon, confessing that &#x201C;&#x2018;as I came up those 
                    pulpit stairs, I had all the parts of this sermon well written on my mind,&#x2019;&#x201D; but that now he could not remember the third head; and so he commanded the organist to &#x201C;&#x2018;strike up 
                    a symphony&#x2019;&#x201D; while the remainder came back to him. His &#x201C;luxuriant fancy&#x201D; seemed all the more glorious &#x201C;because apparently so unpremeditated&#x201D;

                    The earliest reference to <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s preaching in a Ruskin family letter&#x2014;the &#x201C;best sermon from Dr. Andrews,&#x201D; <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> declared, that she &#x201C;ever heard him preach,&#x201D;

                    <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> grew old enough to pay attention to the sermons in <date when="1829">1829</date>, shortly before his tenth birthday: &#x201C;I always liked him,&#x201D; he explained to a family friend,

                    were usually carried out in conspiracy with <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s older cousin,

                <p>Within four months of declaring this infatuation to <persName corresp="#MONROROBERTMRS">Mrs. Monro</persName>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> entered 
                    &#x201C;a most important aera of my life . . . the coming of [<persName corresp="#EA">Dr. Andrews</persName> as his] . . . tutor for the first time&#x201D;&#x2014;an event that he 
                    dated three weeks prior to his writing this, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> said, which would have been about <date when="1829-04-20">20 April 1829</date>) 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 200). 
                    <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>, who came to <placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName> to give lessons on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays (<ref type="witness" target="letter_to_mrs_monro_msii.xml">Letter to Mrs. Monro</ref>), 
                    tutored <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> in classics, the boy having started learning rudimentary Latin probably in <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1827">1826 or 1827</date> 
                    under his parents&#x02BC; supervision (see <ref type="apparatus" target="latin_exercises_apparatus.php">Latin Exercises</ref>). <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> was thus 
                    the first outsider to take over <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x20BC;s parents&#x20BC; role of teaching, causing <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> to retreat to another room in the small <placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName> household, 
                    although she eventually took an active share in <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s Hebrew lessons

                <p>Judgments vary about the scope of <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x20BC;s abilities as a linguist and classicist. Two late&#x2010;century reports are at odds, one pronouncing him 
                    &#x201C;one of the first Greek scholars of the day, . . . said to have derived an income of &#x00A3;1,000 a year from teaching the sons of nobility&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CLEALSTORYCONGREGATIONALISM">Cleal, <hi rend="italic">The Story of Congregationalism in Surrey</hi></ref>, 105), and the other,

                    &#x201C;little more of Greek than the letters, and declensions of nouns,&#x201D; although &#x201C;he wrote the letters prettily, 
                    and had an accurate and sensitive ear for rhythm&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 35:74). 
                    Whatever his qualifications for meeting the boy&#x02BC;s admittedly basic needs, <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x20BC;s most persuasive talent in the youthful <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x20BC;s estimation was that he was fun. 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> reported that &#x201C;makes me laugh almost but not quite to use one of his own expressions . . . he is so funny comparing <persName type="fictional" corresp="#NEPTUNE">Neptune</persName>s lifting up

                    &#x201C;What a nice face he has,&#x201D; <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> decided; &#x201C;I do think to use one of his own expressions he looks best when he frowns next when he laughs and next when he neither frowns nor laughs  Every thing he does is nice&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 200). When <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> and <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> first accosted him in his career 
                    through the lanes of <placeName corresp="#WALWORTH">Walworth</placeName>, he was arrested by the curtsy of the Ruskins&#x201D; nurse, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="strachan_ann_note.php">Ann Strachan</ref>,

                <p>In his innocence, <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> was unprepared to cope with increasing family and financial troubles. Following her twelfth child, <persName corresp="#EHSA">Elizabeth</persName> grew ill. 
                    Long weakened by consumption, she would die in <date when="1831-04">April 1831</date>, followed shortly her two youngest infants

                    In <date when="1831-03">March 1831</date>, as these calamities approached <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> paid an unseemly morning visit to 
                    <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>, to unload &#x201C;a long account of [his <persName corresp="#EHSA">wife</persName>&#x20BC;s] 
                    complaints in the hope,&#x201C; <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> felt certain, &#x201C;that I should say there was no chance of her living long,&#x201D; 
                    for despite such an &#x201C;imprudent&#x201D; confession to a parishioner whom he had known &#x201C;so short a time,&#x201D; 
                    <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> could not prevent himself from &#x201C;enlarg[ing] much on the torment she had been to him for these last ten years,&#x201D; making him endure &#x201C;caprice, jealousy, 
                    unreasonableness and violence&#x201D; that &#x201C;has marred his respectability and fortune and prevented his filling that place in society his talents entitle him to&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 242&#x2013;43). <persName corresp="#MRC">Margaret</persName>&#x20BC;s account incidentally suggests 
                    that <persName corresp="#EHSA">Elizabeth</persName>&#x20BC;s real offense may have been that she was an intellectual and talented woman who had earned censure 
                    for failing to observe the boundaries that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would later define for &#x201C;queens,&#x201D; 
                    in his <date when="1864">1864</date> lecture, <title type="essay" corresp="#JRQUEENS">&#x201C;Of Queens&#x20BC; Gardens&#x201D;</title>. 
                    Women&#x20BC;s education, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would opine, should be &#x201C;nearly, in its course and material of study, the same as a boy&#x20BC;s; 
                    but quite differently directed,&#x201D; in order to &#x201C;sympathize in her husband&#x20BC;s pleasures, 
                    and in those of his best friends.&#x201D; <persName corresp="#EHSA">Elizabeth</persName> was condemned of lacking sympathetic supportiveness, since her perceived mania, whatever it was, 
                    had damaged her husband&#x20BC;s &#x201C;respectability and fortune and prevented his filling that place in society his talents entitle him to.&#x201D; 
                    Regardless of whether <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x20BC;s studies qualified as the male&#x20BC;s &#x201C;foundational and progressive&#x201D; 
                    labor that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would pronounce deserving of female sympathy, no one evidently thought to ask whether this woman&#x20BC;s studies might have been even more so

                <p><persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>, at least, pointed out that <persName corresp="#EA">Edward Andrews</persName> owed his share of blame for his <persName corresp="#EHSA">wife</persName>&#x20BC;s condition, 
                    since &#x201C;to any woman with so numerous a family [he must] have caused much serious and distressing apprehension,&#x201D; 
                    given his &#x201C;flighty . . . habits and manner of conducting his secular affairs, though with the best and kindest intentions.&#x201D; In criticizing his flightiness, 
                    <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> perhaps referred to <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x20BC;s extravagance 
                    in bearing children no less than in cultivating the arts and expensive tastes, the Ruskins having obviously demonstrated greater self&#x2010;government 
                    in childbearing, much less any proneness to &#x201C;unwise indulgence of . . . caprice&#x201C; in women
