                    <p>In a biography of <persName corresp="#EAP">Emily Patmore</persName>, <persName corresp="#IA">Ian Anstruther</persName> characterizes her father, 
                        <persName corresp="#EA">Reverend Andrews</persName>, as combining evangelical seriousness with a robust appreciation of the arts. 
                    Descended from a learned and sophisticated <geogName corresp="#ESSEX">Essex</geogName> family, he followed his father and grandfather into the Nonconformist clergy, 
                    studying at <orgName corresp="#HOXTONACAD">Hoxton Theological College</orgName>, and then at <orgName corresp="#GLASGOWUNIV">Glasgow University</orgName> (the latter a Scottish connection 
                    that perhaps recommended him to the Ruskins&#x02BC; favor)

                    According to <persName corresp="#EPH">Edwin Paxton Hood</persName> (<date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1885">1820&#x2013;85</date>), a <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregational</orgName> minister and a prolific writer about the preaching of his time, 
                    <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> maintained that &#x201C;God . . . should be worshipped with the best of everything . . . best architecture, best painting,

                 <p><persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> entered the <orgName corresp= "#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalist</orgName> <orgName corresp="#HOXTONACAD">Hoxton Academy</orgName> in <date when="1808">1808</date>. 
                     Founded in <date when="1778">1778</date>, <orgName corresp="#HOXTONACAD">Hoxton</orgName> was at this time a growing and important academy, 
                    accommodating thirty to forty students in residence (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GLENLAUNCHINGCLERICALCAREER"><persName corresp="#RGLEN">Glen</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#GLENLAUNCHINGCLERICALCAREER">&#x201C;Launching a Clerical Career in Late Georgian <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>&#x201D;</title></ref>, 645). 
                    The principal, a Scottish divine, <persName corresp="#RSREV">Robert Simpson</persName> (1746&#x2013;1817), did not have the reputation of a scholar, 
                     and candidates were chosen primarily for their &#x201C;good natural abilities&#x201D;, zeal, and commitment to evangelical doctrine 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#NUTTALLTRAININGHOXTON"><persName corresp="#GFNUTTALL">Nuttall</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#NUTTALLTRAININGHOXTON">&#x201C;Training for Hoxton and Highbury&#x201D;</title></ref>, 477;

                     Nonetheless, by the time of <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s matriculation, the <orgName corresp="#HOXTONACAD">Academy</orgName> was observing higher standards of learning, 
                    including securing scholarships to <orgName corresp="#GLASGOWUNIV">Glasgow University</orgName>. An <date when="1810">1810</date> syllabus shows that available studies included the following subjects, 
                     divided among three tutors: &#x201C;Hebrew and biblical criticism, Jewish antiquities, 
                    evidences of divine revelation, systematic divinity, ecclesiastical history, and its connexion with profane [especially Roman] history; . . . 
                    English grammar, geography, Latin (including prose composition) and Greek; . . . pneumatology, logic, and belles lettres, 
                    with special regard to pulpit composition and elocution&#x201D;. Students who, like <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>, proceeded to <orgName corresp="#GLASGOWUNIV">Glasgow University</orgName> fell under 
                     the supervision of <persName corresp="#GEREV">Greville Ewing</persName> (1767&#x2013;1841), a <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregational</orgName> minister and a tutor at the <orgName corresp="#GLASGOWTHEOACAD">Glasgow Theological Academy</orgName>
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#THOMPSONHOXTON"><persName corresp="#DTHOMPSON">Thompson</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#THOMPSONHOXTON">&#x201C;<orgName corresp="#HOXTONACAD">Hoxton [Independent] Academy</orgName> (<date notBefore="1791" notAfter="1826">1791&#x2013;1826</date>) and <orgName corresp="#HIGHBURYCOLLEGE">Highbury College</orgName> (<date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1850">1826&#x2013;1850</date>)&#x201D;</title></ref>).</p>
                <p>The Ruskins began hearing <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> preach in the parish of <placeName corresp="#WALWORTH">Walworth</placeName>, which was a village lying only a few miles south of 
                    <placeName corresp="#LONDONBRDG">London Bridge</placeName>. Like <ref type="note" subtype="geographical" target="camberwell_note.php"><placeName corresp="#CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</placeName></ref>, a little farther to the south 
                    where the Ruskins lived, <placeName corresp="#WALWORTH">Walworth</placeName> was a rapidly growing suburb but still on the edge of the open country and woods around <placeName corresp="#NORWOOD">Norwood</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#DULWICH">Dulwich</placeName>. 
                    The Andrewses&#x02BC; household resembled the Ruskins&#x02BC; with its growing collection of pictures on the walls, a substantial library on the shelves, and gardens outside, 
                    but it would have been a much busier and noisier place than <ref type="note" subtype="geographical" target="herne_hill_note.php"><placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName></ref>. 
                    By the beginning of <date when="1831">1831</date>, the manse had seventeen inhabitants, including <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> and his wife, 
                    <persName corresp="#EHSA">Elizabeth (n&#x00E9;e Elizabeth Honor Symons)</persName>, who was learned and fond of music like her husband; twelve children 
                    (by <date when="1831-06">June 1831</date>, two would die in infancy); three servants; and a few penurious clergymen dependent on the Andrews family&#x02BC;s charity. 
                    In addition, a constant flow of visitors was drawn to the house by the family&#x02BC;s sociability and parish responsibilities. This rising star of the metropolitan pulpit was highly visible, 
                    helped by a dashing appearance that commanded no fewer than a dozen painted, engraved, and sculpted portraits in his relatively brief prime 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ANSTRUTHERCOVENTRYPATMORESANGEL"><title type="book" corresp="#ANSTRUTHERCOVENTRYPATMORESANGEL"><hi rend="italic">Coventry Patmore&#x02BC;s Angel</hi></title></ref>, 13, 19, 123&#x2013;24).</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> officiated in his own chapel in <placeName corresp="#WALKWORTH">Walworth</placeName>, <placeName type="building" corresp="#BERESFORDSTREETCHAPEL">Beresford Street Chapel</placeName>, which adjoined his house. 
                    He was at first a candidate for <placeName type="building" corresp="#CAMDENCHAPEL">Camden Chapel</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#WALKWORTH">Camberwell</placeName>, 
                    where he stirred such excitement that the congregation demanded him for their pastor. Blocked by their trustees, 
                    some members of the congregation broke away and built the <placeName type="building" corresp="#WALWORTHCHAPEL">Walworth Chapel</placeName> for him, financed to some extent by <persName corresp ="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s wealthy father&#x2010;in&#x2010;law 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CLEALSTORYCONGREGATIONALISM"><persName corresp="#EECLEAL">Cleal</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#CLEALSTORYCONGREGATIONALISM"><hi rend="italic">The Story of <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalism</orgName> in <placeName corresp="#SURREY">Surrey</placeName></hi></title></ref>, 105;

                    Such generous arrangements were not unheard&#x2010;of among the most popular preachers&#x2014;especially those whose congregations included wealthy members&#x2014;the 
                    largest of such complexes being <placeName type="building" corresp="#SURREYCHAPEL">Surrey Chapel</placeName>, built to accommodate audiences of 3,000 for the preaching 
                    of <persName corresp="#RHREV">Rowland Hill</persName> (<date notBefore="1744" notAfter="1833">1744&#x2013;1833</date>) in <placeName corresp="#BLACKFRIARS">Blackfriars</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GLENLAUNCHINGCLERICALCAREER"><persName corresp="#RGLEN">Glen</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#GLENLAUNCHINGCLERICALCAREER">&#x201C;Launching a Clerical Career in Late Georgian England&#x201D;</title></ref>, 649;

The crowds pressing to hear <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>  
                    soon grew too large for the <placeName type="building" corresp="#BERESFORDCHAPEL">Beresford Street Chapel</placeName>, and <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> decided to finance an expansion with the aid of a new mortgage, which ultimately proved a ruinous 
                    encumberment (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CLEALSTORYCONGREGATIONALISM"><persName corresp="#EECLEAL">Cleal</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#CLEALSTORYCONGREGATIONALISM"><hi rend="italic">The Story of <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalism</orgName> in <placeName corresp="#SURREY">Surrey</placeName></hi></title></ref>, 105). 
                    In his glory days, <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> attracted crowds larger than could be seated, even in the expanded structure accommodating 1,600 seats 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ANSTRUTHERCOVENTRYPATMORESANGEL"><title type="book" corresp="#ANSTRUTHERCOVENTRYPATMORESANGEL"><hi rend="italic">Coventry Patmore&#x02BC;s Angel</hi></title></ref>, 22&#x2013;23).</p>
                <p>In <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> remembered the chapel as an example of 
                    &#x201C;the Londonian chapel in its perfect type, definable as accurately as a Roman basilica,&#x2014;an oblong, flat&#x2010;ceiled barn, 
                    lighted by windows with semi&#x2010;circular heads, brick&#x2010;arched, filled by small&#x2010;paned glass held by iron bars, like fine threaded halves of cobwebs; galleries propped 
                    on iron pipes, up both side; pews, well shut in, each of them, by partitions of plain deal, and neatly brass&#x2010;latched deal doors, filling the barn floor, 
                    all but its two lateral straw&#x2010;matted passages; pulpit, sublimely isolated, central from sides and clear of altar rails at end; a stout, four&#x2010;legged box 
                    of well&#x2010;grained wainscot, high as the level of front galleries, and decorated with a cushion of crimson velvet, padded six inches thick, with gold tassels at the corners, 
                    which was a great resource to me when I was tired of the sermon, because I liked watching the rich colour of the folds and creases that came in it when the clergyman thumped it&#x201D;. 
                    Like his representation in the autobiography of the toyless austerity of his boyhood, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> exaggerated this description, here in order to make the point that his 
                    &#x201C;well&#x2010;formed habit [in youth] of narrowing myself to happiness within . . . four brick walls&#x201D; supported his &#x201C;acute perception and deep feeling of the beauty of architecture 
                    and scenery abroad&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 35:132; and see

                    that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s prose picture captures accurately enough the &#x201C;perfect type&#x201D; of the late&#x2010;Georgian meeting house, 
                    <persName corresp="#EPH">Hood</persName> remembered that the building&#x02BC;s unusually rich adornments &#x201C;gave you certainly no idea of the dissenting conventicle&#x201D;. 
                    There were &#x201C;stained glass, and the <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#AARON">Aaronic</persName> and <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#MOSES">Mosaic</persName> figures,

                    <p>The 1829 exercises of abstracting Andrews's sermons were a joint project with <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s older cousin, 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_mary_note.php"><persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName> (<date notBefore="1815" notAfter="1849">1815&#x2013;49</date>)</ref>. 
                        At that time, Ruskin's orphaned cousin, who was between thirteen and fourteen, had come to live with her aunt and uncle permanently less than a year earlier, 
                    and she would have only recently passed through the stage of deepest mourning for her mother. It was likely Mary's enthusiasm, therefore, 
                    that fired John's sudden attraction to a preacher who had been familiar to the family for at least three years, since John was six or seven. 
                    On Monday, 19 January 1829, "We that is Mary I" were "so delighted" with Andrews's "beautiful Sermon" the day before, John reported to his father, 
                    that they persuaded the family nurse to venture "out in a hunt after Dr Andrews" and encountered "him running full-speed". 
                    The nurse, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="strachan_ann_note.php"><persName corresp="#ASB">Ann Strachan</persName></ref>, intercepted him with a curtsey; and after the clergyman asked "a few questions"--Andrews evidently did not recognize the children--"he 
                    patted [the dog] gipsey and ran off as he came" 
                    (<title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_jjr_1829-01-19">letter of 19 January 1829</title>, in

                    <p>Within only three months of this encounter, "papa seeing how fond I was of the doctor and knowing him to be an excellent latin scholar 
                    got him for me as a tutor", as John explained to Mrs. Monro (<ref type="witness" target="jr_to_monrorobertmrs_1829_msii.php"><title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_monrorobertmrs_1829">Letter to Mrs. Monro</title></ref>). 
                        In John James's household account ledger, he dated his first payment to Andrews on 8 April 1829 for &#x00A3;20 (the same amount was paid again in July and September 
                        [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28">Account Book</ref>, 11v]). In his letter to Mrs. Monro, John at first wrote "bought him for me as tutor" 
                        and then corrected <hi rend="italic">bought</hi> to <hi rend="italic">got</hi>--a telling slip, suggesting that John perceived Andrews's engagement 
                        in the manner of his father's coming-home present (perhaps in competition with Mary), John James having been traveling on business from January through at least mid-March, 
                        during the height of the Andrews fever. By May, however, following his first lessons with Andrews, and after a family friend had impressed on him 
                        that "the coming of the tutor for the first time&#x201D; constituted &#x201C;a most important aera of my life", Ruskin wrote more solemnly 
                        about his "master" such as "few boys have" (<title type="letter" corresp="#jr_to_jjr_1829-05-10">letter of 10 May 1829</title>, in

                        (According to John's calculations in his <title type="letter" corresp="#jr_to_jjr_1829-05-10">10 May 1829 birthday letter for his father</title>, 
                        his first lesson had occurred "three weeks [ago] and more", or around <date when="1829-04-20">20 April 1829</date>, more than a week after 
                        John James's first payment to Andrews [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 200;

                        The lessons would not have started from scratch, Ruskin having begun learning rudimentary Latin probably 
                    in <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1827">1826 or 1827</date> under his parents&#x02BC; supervision (see 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="latin_exercises_apparatus.php">Latin Exercises</ref>). John James continued to take some part in coaching Latin, 
                    as shown by letters of <title type="letter" corresp="#jjr_to_jr_1829-10-19">19 October</title>, <title type="letter" corresp="#jjr_to_jr_1829-10-26">26 October</title>, and

                    and much later, according to a <title type="letter" corresp="#jr_to_jjr_1829-02-21">letter of 21 February 1831</title>, 
                    when Andrews had moved on to instructing John in Greek and Hebrew, John James required his son to "write regularly a page of 
                    <persName corresp="#JCLARKE">Clarke</persName>" and submit the lesson to  him for correction 
                    (i.e., <persName corresp="#JCLARKE">John Clarke</persName>, <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CLARKELATIN"><title type="lesson" corresp="#CLARKELATIN"><hi rend="italic">An Introduction to the Making of Latin</hi></title></ref>)

                    <p>Margaret probably left the drills to the men, just as, when Andrews started coming to Herne Hill, she retreated from the room in which he held lessons; 
                        nonetheless, she maintained her role in John's education, "supply[ing John James's] place morning and evening as reader" in his absence, 
                        as she reminded her husband. Beyond the daily Bible chapters, diversified by travels and histories, that she had read with John since early boyhood, 
                        Margaret now willingly took on volumes as taxing as <persName corresp="#JHT">John Horne Tooke</persName>'s philosophical approach to grammar, 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#TOOKEDIVERSIONS"><title type="book" corresp="#TOOKEDIVERSIONS"><hi rend="italic">ΕΠΕΑ ΠΤΕΡΟΕΝΤΑ [Epea Pteroenta]; or, the Diversions of Purley</hi></title></ref>. 
                        In choosing to study a grammar text at this juncture in John's education, Margaret demonstrates that she accepted the Englishwoman's role, if not to instruct erudite languages, at least to assist in regulating language. 
                        She thereby supported John's rite of passage to masculinity, advancing him from her teaching of the English mother tongue since infancy, 
                        and passing him along to the male domain of classical languages taught by a master 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#COHENFASHIONING"><persName corresp="#MCOHEN">Cohen</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#COHENFASHIONING"><hi rend="italic">Fashioning Masculinity</hi></title></ref>, 31). 
                        Yet in the choice of a sophisticated philosophical treatise on grammar like Tooke's, Margaret also asserts her own intellectual ambition: while acknowledging to John James that "the greek &#x0026; Latin quotations increase . . . 
                    [the book's] obscurity greatly to me[,] still I think I comprehend more than when I last looked over" the book; and now she finds herself "amused as well as interested[;] how can people who are not always occupied 
                    in business &#x0026; society exist without reading or hearing reading[?]". 
                    Later, Margaret took an active part in <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s Hebrew lessons, introduced by Andrews along with Greek 
                    (letters of <title type="letter" corresp="#mr_to_jjr_1829-03-12">12 March</title> and <title type="letter" corresp="mr_to_jjr_1829-10-31">31 October 1829</title>,

                    <p>As a boy&#x02BC;s preparation for manhood, however, the most pronounced characteristic of <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s pedagogy 
                        was less its strenuousness--at least at first, according to Ruskin's account--than its fun: &#x201C;he makes me laugh almost but not quite to use one of his own expressions", 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> delightedly reported in 1829; "he is so funny comparing <persName type="fictional" corresp="#NEPTUNE">Neptune</persName>s lifting up

                        The opposite of a stern disciplinarian, Andrews was gentle and kind with children, servants, and pets:

                        Ruskin was then looking backward from the eminence of his classical studies of the 1860s and 1870s. In his youth, John and his parents appear to have regarded his progress as substantial. 
                        Taking stock after seven months of lessons, Margaret commented that one day's lesson included fifty lines of Virgil, 
                        which John reviewed with only two errors--an achievement that, for John James, merited declaiming his son as 
                        "a little Horace a small Cicero", deserving the "rank as a Classic" in his own right. Owing to a gap in the family letters for 1830, the next glimpse of Ruskin's study schedule comes more than a year later, 
                        when Margaret considers him very busy at "having every day gone regularly through his latin exercise &#x0026; grammar an hour of Greek 
                        some of prosody and the Bible got by heart" (letters of <title type="letter" corresp="#mr_to_jjr_1829-10-20">20 October</title>, <title type="letter" corresp="jjr_to_jr_1829-10-26">26 October 1829</title>,

                <p>While tutoring Ruskin, <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>'s fortunes declined as rapidly as they had risen. As early as October 1829, 
                    Margaret perceived him as overextended: "I fear the Doctor will undertake too much[;] he is getting more pupils" (<title type="letter" corresp="mr_to_jjr_1829-10-31">letter of 31 October 1829</title>, in

                    In 1831, tragedy beset the family, when Andrews's wife, <persName corresp="#EHSA">Elizabeth</persName>, grew ill from the birth of their twelfth child. 
                    Long weakened by consumption, Elizabeth died in <date when="1831-04">April 1831</date>, followed shortly by the passing of the two youngest infants

                    In <date when="1831-03">March 1831</date>, as these calamities approached, <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> paid what <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> 
                    considered an unseemly morning visit, to unload &#x201C;a long account of [his <persName corresp="#EHSA">wife</persName>&#x02BC;s] 
                    complaints in the hope&#x201C;, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> felt certain, &#x201C;that I should say there was no chance of her living long&#x201D;. 
                    Despite such an &#x201C;imprudent&#x201D; confession to a parishioner whom he had known &#x201C;so short a time&#x201D; in Margaret's estimation, 
                    <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> could not forebear from &#x201C;enlarg[ing] much on the torment [his wife] . . . had been to him for these last ten years&#x201D;, making him endure &#x201C;caprice, jealousy, 
                    unreasonableness and violence&#x201D; that &#x201C;has marred his respectability and fortune and prevented his filling that place in society his talents entitle him to&#x201D;

                    <p><persName corresp="#MRC">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s account incidentally suggests 
                    that <persName corresp="#EHSA">Elizabeth Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s real offense may have been that she was an intellectual and talented woman who had earned censure 
                    for failing to observe the boundaries that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would later define for &#x201C;queens&#x201D; 
                    in his <date when="1864">1864</date> lecture, <title type="essay" corresp="#JRQUEENS">&#x201C;Of Queens&#x02BC; Gardens&#x201D;</title>. 
                    Women&#x02BC;s education, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would opine, should be &#x201C;nearly, in its course and material of study, the same as a boy&#x02BC;s; 
                    but quite differently directed&#x201D; in order to &#x201C;sympathize in her husband&#x02BC;s pleasures, 
                    and in those of his best friends&#x201D;. <persName corresp="#EHSA">Elizabeth</persName> was condemned of lacking sympathetic supportiveness, since her perceived mania, whatever it was, 
                    had damaged her husband&#x02BC;s &#x201C;respectability and fortune and prevented his filling that place in society his talents entitle him to&#x201D;. 
                    Regardless of whether <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s vocation and talents qualified as the male&#x02BC;s &#x201C;foundational and progressive&#x201D; 
                    labor that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would later pronounce to be deserving of female sympathy, no one evidently thought to ask whether this woman&#x02BC;s studies might have been just as foundational for her

                <p><persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>, at least, pointed out that <persName corresp="#EA">Edward Andrews</persName> deserved a share of blame for his <persName corresp="#EHSA">wife</persName>&#x02BC;s condition, 
                    since &#x201C;to any woman with so numerous a family [he must] have caused much serious and distressing apprehension&#x201D;, 
                    given his &#x201C;flighty . . . habits and manner of conducting his secular affairs, though with the best and kindest intentions&#x201D;. In criticizing his flightiness, 
                    <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> perhaps referred in part to <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s extravagance 
                    in bearing children, no less than his improvidence in cultivating the arts and expensive tastes beyond a clergyman's sphere--the Ruskins having obviously demonstrated greater self&#x2010;government 
                    in childbearing, much less allowing &#x201C;unwise indulgence of" a woman's alleged "caprice&#x201D;
