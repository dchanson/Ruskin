                    <p>In a biography of <persName corresp="#EAP">Emily Patmore</persName>, <persName corresp="#IA">Ian Anstruther</persName> characterizes her father, 
                        <persName corresp="#EA">Reverend Andrews</persName>, as combining evangelical seriousness with a robust appreciation of the arts. 
                    Descended from a learned and sophisticated <geogName corresp="#ESSEX">Essex</geogName> family, he followed his father and grandfather into the Nonconformist clergy, 
                    studying at <orgName corresp="#HOXTONACAD">Hoxton Theological College</orgName>, and then at <orgName corresp="#GLASGOWUNIV">Glasgow University</orgName> (the latter a Scottish connection

                    According to <persName corresp="#EPH">Edwin Paxton Hood</persName> (<date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1885">1820&#x2013;85</date>), a <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregational</orgName> minister and a prolific writer about the preaching of his time,

                 <p><persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> entered the <orgName corresp= "#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalist</orgName> <orgName corresp="#HOXTONACAD">Hoxton Academy</orgName> in <date when="1808">1808</date>. 
                     Founded in <date when="1778">1778</date>, <orgName corresp="#HOXTONACAD">Hoxton</orgName> was at this time a growing and important academy,

                    The principal, a Scottish divine, <persName corresp="#RSREV">Robert Simpson</persName> (1746&#x2013;1817), did not have the reputation of a scholar, 
                     and candidates were chosen primarily for their &#x201C;good natural abilities&#x201D;, zeal, and commitment to evangelical doctrine 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#NUTTALLTRAININGHOXTON"><persName corresp="#GFNUTTALL">Nuttall</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#NUTTALLTRAININGHOXTON">&#x201C;Training for Hoxton and Highbury&#x201D;</title></ref>, 477;

                     Nonetheless, by the time of <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s matriculation, the <orgName corresp="#HOXTONACAD">Academy</orgName> was observing higher standards of learning, 
                    including securing scholarships to <orgName corresp="#GLASGOWUNIV">Glasgow University</orgName>. An <date when="1810">1810</date> syllabus shows that available studies included the following subjects, 
                     divided among three tutors: &#x201C;Hebrew and biblical criticism, Jewish antiquities, 
                    evidences of divine revelation, systematic divinity, ecclesiastical history, and its connexion with profane [especially Roman] history; . . . 
                    English grammar, geography, Latin (including prose composition) and Greek; . . . pneumatology, logic, and belles lettres, 
                    with special regard to pulpit composition and elocution&#x201D;. Students who, like <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>, proceeded to <orgName corresp="#GLASGOWUNIV">Glasgow University</orgName> fell under 
                     the supervision of <persName corresp="#GEREV">Greville Ewing</persName> (1767&#x2013;1841), a <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregational</orgName> minister and a tutor at the <orgName corresp="#GLASGOWTHEOACAD">Glasgow Theological Academy</orgName>
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#THOMPSONHOXTON"><persName corresp="#DTHOMPSON">Thompson</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#THOMPSONHOXTON">&#x201C;<orgName corresp="#HOXTONACAD">Hoxton [Independent] Academy</orgName> (<date notBefore="1791" notAfter="1826">1791&#x2013;1826</date>) and <orgName corresp="#HIGHBURYCOLLEGE">Highbury College</orgName> (<date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1850">1826&#x2013;1850</date>)&#x201D;</title></ref>).</p>
                <p>The Ruskins began hearing <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> preach in the parish of <placeName corresp="#WALWORTH">Walworth</placeName>, which was a village lying only a few miles south of 
                    <placeName corresp="#LONDONBRDG">London Bridge</placeName>. Like <ref type="note" subtype="geographical" target="camberwell_note.php"><placeName corresp="#CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</placeName></ref>, a little farther to the south 
                    where the Ruskins lived, <placeName corresp="#WALWORTH">Walworth</placeName> was a rapidly growing suburb but still on the edge of the open country and woods around <placeName corresp="#NORWOOD">Norwood</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#DULWICH">Dulwich</placeName>. 
                    The Andrewses&#x02BC; household resembled the Ruskins&#x02BC; with its growing collection of pictures on the walls, a substantial library on the shelves, and gardens outside, 
                    but it would have been a much busier and noisier place than <ref type="note" subtype="geographical" target="herne_hill_note.php"><placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName></ref>. 
                    By the beginning of <date when="1831">1831</date>, the manse had seventeen inhabitants, including <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> and his wife, 
                    <persName corresp="#EHSA">Elizabeth (n&#x00E9;e Elizabeth Honor Symons)</persName>, who was learned and fond of music like her husband; twelve children 
                    (by <date when="1831-06">June 1831</date>, two would die in infancy); three servants; and a few penurious clergymen dependent on the Andrews family&#x02BC;s charity. 
                    In addition, a constant flow of visitors was drawn to the house by the family&#x02BC;s sociability and parish responsibilities. This rising star of the metropolitan pulpit was highly visible, 
                    helped by a dashing appearance that commanded no fewer than a dozen painted, engraved, and sculpted portraits in his relatively brief prime 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ANSTRUTHERCOVENTRYPATMORESANGEL"><title type="book" corresp="#ANSTRUTHERCOVENTRYPATMORESANGEL"><hi rend="italic">Coventry Patmore&#x02BC;s Angel</hi></title></ref>, 13, 19, 123&#x2013;24).</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> officiated in his own chapel in <placeName corresp="#WALKWORTH">Walworth</placeName>, <placeName type="building" corresp="#BERESFORDSTREETCHAPEL">Beresford Street Chapel</placeName>, which adjoined his house. 
                    He was at first a candidate for <placeName type="building" corresp="#CAMDENCHAPEL">Camden Chapel</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#WALKWORTH">Camberwell</placeName>, 
                    where he stirred such excitement that the congregation demanded him for their pastor. Blocked by their trustees, 
                    some members of the congregation broke away and built the <placeName type="building" corresp="#WALWORTHCHAPEL">Walworth Chapel</placeName> for him, financed to some extent by <persName corresp ="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s wealthy father&#x2010;in&#x2010;law 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CLEALSTORYCONGREGATIONALISM"><persName corresp="#EECLEAL">Cleal</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#CLEALSTORYCONGREGATIONALISM"><hi rend="italic">The Story of <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalism</orgName> in <placeName corresp="#SURREY">Surrey</placeName></hi></title></ref>, 105;

                    Such generous arrangements were not unheard&#x2010;of among the most popular preachers&#x2014;especially those whose congregations included wealthy members&#x2014;the 
                    largest of such complexes being <placeName type="building" corresp="#SURREYCHAPEL">Surrey Chapel</placeName>, built to accommodate audiences of 3,000 for the preaching 
                    of <persName corresp="#RHREV">Rowland Hill</persName> (<date notBefore="1744" notAfter="1833">1744&#x2013;1833</date>) in <placeName corresp="#BLACKFRIARS">Blackfriars</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>

The crowds pressing to hear <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>  
                    soon grew too large for the <placeName type="building" corresp="#BERESFORDCHAPEL">Beresford Street Chapel</placeName>, and <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> decided to finance an expansion with the aid of a new mortgage, which ultimately proved a ruinous 
                    encumberment (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CLEALSTORYCONGREGATIONALISM"><persName corresp="#EECLEAL">Cleal</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#CLEALSTORYCONGREGATIONALISM"><hi rend="italic">The Story of <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalism</orgName> in <placeName corresp="#SURREY">Surrey</placeName></hi></title></ref>, 105). 
                    In his glory days, <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> attracted crowds larger than could be seated, even in the expanded structure accommodating 1,600 seats 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ANSTRUTHERCOVENTRYPATMORESANGEL"><title type="book" corresp="#ANSTRUTHERCOVENTRYPATMORESANGEL"><hi rend="italic">Coventry Patmore&#x02BC;s Angel</hi></title></ref>, 22&#x2013;23).</p>
                <p>In <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> remembered the chapel as an example of 
                    &#x201C;the Londonian chapel in its perfect type, definable as accurately as a Roman basilica,&#x2014;an oblong, flat&#x2010;ceiled barn, 
                    lighted by windows with semi&#x2010;circular heads, brick&#x2010;arched, filled by small&#x2010;paned glass held by iron bars, like fine threaded halves of cobwebs; galleries propped 
                    on iron pipes, up both side; pews, well shut in, each of them, by partitions of plain deal, and neatly brass&#x2010;latched deal doors, filling the barn floor, 
                    all but its two lateral straw&#x2010;matted passages; pulpit, sublimely isolated, central from sides and clear of altar rails at end; a stout, four&#x2010;legged box 
                    of well&#x2010;grained wainscot, high as the level of front galleries, and decorated with a cushion of crimson velvet, padded six inches thick, with gold tassels at the corners, 
                    which was a great resource to me when I was tired of the sermon, because I liked watching the rich colour of the folds and creases that came in it when the clergyman thumped it&#x201D;. 
                    Like his representation in the autobiography of the toyless austerity of his boyhood, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> exaggerated this description, here in order to make the point that his 
                    &#x201C;well&#x2010;formed habit [in youth] of narrowing myself to happiness within . . . four brick walls&#x201D; supported his &#x201C;acute perception and deep feeling of the beauty of architecture 
                    and scenery abroad&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 35:132; and see

                    <persName corresp="#EPH">Hood</persName> remembered that the building&#x02BC;s unusually rich adornments &#x201C;gave you certainly no idea of the dissenting conventicle&#x201D;. 
                    There were &#x201C;stained glass, and the <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#AARON">Aaronic</persName> and <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#MOSES">Mosaic</persName> figures,

                    <p>How rigorous was <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s tutelage? Judgments vary about the scope of his abilities as a linguist and classicist. Two late&#x2010;century reports are at odds, one pronouncing him

                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was then looking backward from the eminence of his classical studies of the <date notBefore="1860" notAfter="1869">1860s</date> and <date notBefore="1870" notAfter="1879">1870s</date>. In his youth, <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> and his parents appear to have regarded his progress as substantial. 
                        Taking stock after seven months of lessons, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> commented that one day&#x02BC;s lesson included fifty lines of <persName corresp="#PVM">Virgil</persName>,

                    Long weakened by consumption, <persName corresp="#EHSA">Elizabeth</persName> died in <date when="1831-04">April 1831</date>, followed shortly by the passing of the two youngest infants

                    that <persName corresp="#EHSA">Elizabeth Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s real offense may have been that she was an intellectual and talented woman who had earned censure 
                    for failing to observe the boundaries that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would later define for &#x201C;queens&#x201D;

                    Women&#x02BC;s education, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would opine, should be &#x201C;nearly, in its course and material of study, the same as a boy&#x02BC;s; 
                    but quite differently directed&#x201D; in order to &#x201C;sympathize in her husband&#x02BC;s pleasures, 
                    and in those of his best friends&#x201D;. <persName corresp="#EHSA">Elizabeth</persName> was condemned of lacking sympathetic supportiveness, since her perceived mania, whatever it was,

                    labor that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would later pronounce to be deserving of female sympathy, no one evidently thought to ask whether this woman&#x02BC;s studies might have been just as foundational for her

                <p><persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>, at least, pointed out that <persName corresp="#EA">Edward Andrews</persName> deserved a share of blame for his <persName corresp="#EHSA">wife</persName>&#x02BC;s condition,

                    given his &#x201C;flighty . . . habits and manner of conducting his secular affairs, though with the best and kindest intentions&#x201D;. In criticizing his flightiness, 
                    <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> perhaps referred in part to <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s extravagance 
                    in bearing children, no less than his improvidence in cultivating the arts and expensive tastes beyond a clergyman&#x02BC;s sphere&#x2014;the Ruskins having obviously demonstrated greater self&#x2010;government 
                    in childbearing, much less allowing &#x201C;unwise indulgence of&#x201D; a woman&#x02BC;s alleged &#x201C;caprice&#x201D;
