                        <p>The Andron Scriptor Web font used by this project is a special edition of Andreas St&#x00F6;tznerâ€™s Andron Font Project,
                            financed by the Norwegian Research Council and the University of Bergen. It has been issued to support scholarly editing
                            in medieval philological studies and is provided free of charge. The creator and the provider of the font, Andreas
                            St&#x00F6;tzner and the Medieval Unicode Font Initiative (MUFI), have to be credited in colophons of works which utilize
                            the font. Any alteration to the font, including its contents, disposition, glyph shapes, and/or name, is a violation of
                            international copyright law and therefore strictly prohibited. If enhancements and/or improvements to the font are
                            desired, these should be forwarded to MUFI for consideration in future updates of the font. Andron is a trademark of
