My dear mrs monro
	You have no Idea how much I wish you to be here with us but the grove is quite spoiled for in the . . . of it they have cut down the trees on both sides but left the top & bottom trees standing. But what is even worse in the place where the trees are cut down the side of the road where you used to live is full of half built houses which look twice as bad as if they were finished In short the grove is quite ruined but if you could but come and live near us . . . I should be so happy. I was extremely sorry to learn of your illness but also extremely glad to hear that you rallied  . . . you know while you were with us we went to a minister of the name of doctor andrews I always liked him but of late I began to attend to his sermons and write them in a book at . . . and I liked him much better as did also mary

who who you know has come to . . . to live with us. I can give you an instance of our fondness. We that is mary anne and I were walking one day to meet the doctor or as we generally style him the dear doctor  we soon espyed him walking upon the other side of the road and of course we jumped  over to meet him but just as we were coming to him he jumped down the bank and ran across the road so as Mary and I did not wish to miss meeting he doctor we ran back a short way. I . . . across the road and met him bounce in the face. But what is all this trash about I don't see any particular purpose of it except to fill up paper . . . Well papa seeing how fond I was of the doctor -- and knowing him to be an excellent latin scholar <bought> got him for me as a tutor and every lesson I get I like him

better and better for he makes me laugh almost but not quite to use one of his own expressions the whole time he is so funny comparing Neptunes lifting up the wrecked ships of eenaes with his trident to my lifting up a potatoe  with a fork or taking a piece of bread out of a bowl of milk with a spoon and as he is always saying of that kind
