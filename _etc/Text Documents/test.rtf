Methought It sung a dirge for him\
Who once on its green borders drew\
The fanciful the fairy crew\
And seemed a voice in measured tone\
To breathe a melancholy moan\
And whispring <sedgy> sullen soundings sighed\
As mingling with the murmuring tide\
And sorrowing <sounds> notes of woe they gave\
As floating on the mystic wave\
And with the waters born along\
They joined with every zephyrs song\
The billows wept that they no more \
When rolling towrds the hallowed shore\
Might dance unto the living lays\
That minstrels magic <hand> voice could raise\
Where every mocking mountain <sun> rung\
With the rich numbers that he sung\
Where piney forests when he spoke\
Their hoary locks in wonder shook\
And bent their <hoary> spiry heads when he \
