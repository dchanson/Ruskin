                        <p>The archive contains, at the most fundamental level, two sets of edited primary materials: 
                            <hi rend="italic">works</hi> and <hi rend="italic">manuscripts</hi>.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>A <hi rend="italic">work</hi> in this edition consists of a discrete text
                                by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> (e.g., a poem, an essay, a
                                sermon, a mathematical proof), including all available witnesses of that
                                text (each of these edited and annotated), and accompanied by the
                                work&#x02BC;s explanatory apparatus and available facsimiles.</item>
                            <item>A <hi rend="italic">manuscript</hi> is a physical document manifesting
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s texts. 
                                A given work may be confined, so far as presently known, to a single text witness found in a single manuscript; 
                                or a work may be made up of multiple text witnesses found in more than one manuscript. In the archive, 
                                a manuscript is represented by an explanatory apparatus; its contents are represented by the <hi rend="italic">works</hi> 
                                (text witness(es) and apparatuses) that constitute the manuscript.</item>
                        </list>
                        
                        <p>As translated into Web pages, these two sets of materials form a given work&#x02BC;s Work Pages,
                            and a given manuscript&#x02BC;s Manuscript Pages (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="plan_of_archive_note.php">Plan of the Archive</ref>). 
                            This organization arose from our determination editorially to strive for a double centeredness, which reflects 
                            a creative tension between <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s composition of a unitary work and his dynamic conception 
                            of the collection containing that work. From the earliest juvenilia, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was evidently fascinated by the dynamic potential of a work 
                            to contain or be contained by something else&#x2014;doubling the central unit of composition.</p>
                        <p>Historically, a more static editorial approach to the early manuscripts was adopted by 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="collingwood_w_g_note.php"><persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName></ref>, the editor of 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)</title></ref>, and, 
                            following his suit, by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="cook_e_t_note.php"><persName corresp="#ETC">E. T. Cook</persName></ref> and 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="wedderburn_note.php"><persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName></ref>, the editors of the 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title></ref>. 
                            They separated the early writing by genre, poetry and prose, with  <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> taking the lead by dividing his task 
                            into the <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)</title> and a planned complementary edition of prose&#x2014;the latter never realized under his editorship. 
                            Accordingly, when <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> fashioned the first descriptive bibliography of the early manuscripts, the 
                            <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D;</title>, 
                            published as an appendix to the <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)</title>, 
                            he awkwardly set apart the verse manuscripts from prose manuscripts in the archive available to him, 
                            describing and chronologically ordering only those manuscripts containing poetry. 
                            The division has proved problematic even on terms of the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note&#x201D;</title> itself, 
                            which neglects to describe or explain prose works (or prose contained within largely verse works) present in some of the manuscripts that it does acknowledge, 
                            and which altogether omits mention of manuscripts that contain solely prose 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS4D1891"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</title></ref>,1:261&#x2013;67;

                        <p>In the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title></ref>, 
                            <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> addressed the problems raised by this division only imperfectly. 
                            The editors maintained <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s scheme by separately housing early prose and poetry (volumes 1 and 2, respectively), 
                            but in the prose volume they did not attempt to match <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note&#x201D;</title> 
                            on the poetry with a corresponding bibliographical description of the prose. Rather, in volume 1 they hastily repackaged 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="allen_george_note.php"><persName corresp="#GA">George Allen</persName> (<date notBefore="1832" notAfter="1907">1832&#x2013;1907</date>)</ref>
                            existing republications of early prose from the <date notBefore="1890" notAfter="1899">1890s</date>. In the second volume of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>, 
                            &#x201C;Poems,&#x201D; the editors reprinted <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note&#x201D;</title>, 
                            only expanding it with brief descriptions of some additional verse manuscripts, and with lists by title of the poems contained in the manuscripts, 
                            but without questioning the fundamental logic or serviceability of separating poetry manuscripts from prose 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 2:529&#x2013;41). 
                            Of physical manuscripts that the editors found at <placeName corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName> that contained exclusively early prose, 
                            they bound some along with poems (e.g., forming <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title></ref>), 
                            while omitting mention of those prose pieces in their revision of the bibliographical <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note&#x201D;</title>; 
                            and they bound or preserved some other physical manuscripts containing prose early works, relegating their description to the &#x201D;Bibliography&#x201D; volume (vol. 39) 
                            of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>. These latter descriptions were classified as &#x201C;Juvenilia&#x201D;&#x2014;as if 
                            the early poetry manuscripts listed in the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note&#x201D;</title> were not themselves &#x201C;juvenilia.&#x201D; 
                            Thus, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s editorial scheme&#x2014;which, if flawed in its logic, was at least carried out consistently and reasonably accurately&#x2014;was now 
                            confused by inconsistency and unevenness of bibliographical description and editorial procedure (see also 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="history_of_bibliography_and_editing_note.php">History of the Bibliography and Editing of the Early Manuscripts</ref>).
                        </p><!-- DCH, intros to these volumes -->
                        <p><persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s decision to divide the editorial task by genre, while arguably misguided in itself, 
                            and certainly compromised by <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s inconsistencies, 
                            is nonetheless significant for reflecting historical conditions of reception. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in his late autobiographical writing 
                            encouraged readers to conceptualize his career as divided between an early misdirected ambition to become a poet 
                            and a discovery of his true vocation as a prose writer. Moreover, according to autobiographical accounts in <title type="book" corresp="#JRFORS"><hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi></title> 
                            and <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, the prose that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intended as representative of his vocation 
                            was not the poetic prose of his youth, but the allegedly more analytical and plain prose of later years. This account of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            genres is faithfully reflected in fin&#x2010;de&#x2010;si&#x00E8;cle biographical and editorial projects, even 
                            at the cost of distorting facts, such as <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s insistence that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            started his professional writing life by having first published scientific prose, and not poetry, 
                            although <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> definitely knew the opposite to be the truth (see 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="on_skiddaw_and_derwentwater_apparatus.php#COMPPUB"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D;</title>: Composition and Publication</ref>).</p>
                        <p>In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, rather than perpetuating the late&#x2010;century conceptualization of the early manuscripts in terms of a vocational watershed, 
                            the archive is organized around the creatively dynamic tension that is perceivable throughout the early writing&#x2014;the tension, namely, 
                            between the unitary work and the larger anthology or collection containing it. In the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref> 
                            of the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            projected his prose compositions as &#x201C;volumes&#x201D; in an ongoing multi&#x2010;volume series, while filling out each of these &#x201C;volumes&#x201D; 
                            with poems collected into small anthologies. Eventually, he developed unitary works as multi&#x2010;genre anthologies in themselves, 
                            as in the <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php">Account of a Tour on the Continent</ref> 
                            of <date notBefore="1833" notAfter="1834">1833&#x2013;34</date>, which he designed initially as a travelogue solely in verse, 
                            but then re&#x2010;conceived as a composite&#x2010;genre travelogue in verse, prose, and picture. 
                            In his youth, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was interested more in the dynamic relation of poetry and prose than in their separation. 
                            At the same time, it is also true, alongside these increasingly complex and lengthy composite projects, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> observed 
                            the generic boundaries of some poetic, scientific, and theological manuscripts of the mid&#x2010;1830s onward. Inevitably, in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, 
                            the organization of the archive into Work Pages and Manuscript Pages tends to dispel some of these tensions even as the plan attempts to represent 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s compositional practices. Offsetting this inevitable cost in the static architecture of the archive, 
                            we have been able to exploit features of a key <orgName corresp="#TEI">Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)</orgName> element in our attempt to capture 
                            some of the dynamism of the relation between container and contained in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s

                        <p>Editing the early <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts therefore calls for representing both the integrity of a unitary work 
                            and what <persName corresp="#NF">Neil Fraistat</persName> terms its <hi rend="italic">contexture</hi>&#x2014;the work&#x02BC;s 
                            potential to contribute to some grander stage of organization (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRAISTATPOEMANDTHEBOOK">Fraistat, <hi rend="italic">The Poem and the Book</hi></ref>, 4). 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> used his manuscripts to build contexture among the works they contain, sometimes exploring loose associations among rapidly drafted, successive fragments in the rough&#x2010;draft notebooks, 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msvi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title></ref> and <ref type="apparatus" target="msviii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title></ref>, 
                            and sometimes treating manuscripts as &#x201C;volumes&#x201D; or miscellanies in an expanding corpus&#x2014;the individual volumes themselves often made up partly of anthologies, as 
                            found in several of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref> and in 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msv_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title></ref>, <ref type="apparatus" target="msvii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title></ref>, and

                            To represent both the contexture of the unitary work and the integrity of the unitary work in itself, 
                            <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> uses the <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> element, &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009;, 
                            combined with standoff markup using <title type="program" corresp="#XINCLUDE">XInclude</title>. Since &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; can both contain and be contained by other &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; documents, 
                            we have found that the element serves as the most available means to represent <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s double centeredness in both work and manuscript, text and contexture.</p>

                            likewise recognized as the chief entity of the archive, and which he numbered 
                            according to a rough chronological sequence by roman numeral in his <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note&#x201D;</title>.

                            listing the titles in the sequence in which they occur (which is not necessarily an indication of their order of composition), 
                            and they did the same for collections that were not originally bound but that they gathered and bound themselves (usually in red buckram), entitled with a roman numeral, 
                            and inserted into their version of <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note&#x201D;</title>. 
                            This attention to the bound manuscript as a container, in neither <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s nor 
                            <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s case, fundamentally affected an editorial practice 
                            that turned on the discrete text, presented chronologically. In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> likewise, we transcribe and annotate discrete works 
                            (using a documentary approach, not the earlier editors&#x02BC; eclectic and aesthetic approaches), but we also seek to describe 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s strategies for contexture. The results are expressed as what the user finds listed on the Index Page 
                            as <hi rend="italic">manuscripts</hi> and <hi rend="italic">corpora</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Manuscripts that were bound when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first used them (e.g., the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref>, 
                            ledgers, and other half&#x2010; or quarter&#x2010;calf notebooks) presented a space defined by the parameters of their covers, 
                            which he conceptualized filling (at least initially) in some cases as &#x201C;volumes&#x201D; in a series, 
                            such as the volumes of the &#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D; lessons, along with their complementary poetry anthologies (e.g.,

                            and which he formed in other cases as miscellanies, such as the

                            The term <hi rend="italic">corpora</hi> is reserved in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> for those collections showing particularly strong contexture, 
                            because <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> developed them as a unified project, often (but not necessarily) assigning an encompassing title. 
                            Corpora include the separate poetry anthologies found in the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref>; 
                            the serialized works, each of which may be viewed separately as discrete texts, but which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            explicitly linked together as a common project, such as the &#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D; lessons; and most interestingly, works that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            evolved as composite, multi&#x2010;genre compilations, such as the

                        <p>The distinction between corpora and manuscripts admittedly is ambiguous, with the contexture of corpora elevated by only a degree of intentionality above that of manuscripts&#x2014;the 
                            latter exhibiting looser but still definable contexture, such as <ref type="apparatus" target="msv_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title></ref>, 
                            which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> compiled incrementally, open&#x2010;endedly, and somewhat randomly, 
                            one fair&#x2010;copy poem after another, yet still definably as &#x201C;Miscellaneous Poetry.&#x201D; 
                            In terms of <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> markup, both corpora and manuscripts are enclosed by the same &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; element. 
                            The slippage of one category into the other reflects <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            own dynamic process of containment and expansion. He was even apt at times, like <persName corresp="#WW">Wordsworth</persName>, to think of the entirety 
                            of his &#x201C;works&#x201D; as a single corpus, as suggested by an annotation on 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title></ref>.</p>
                        <p>A more conventional way of representing anthologies in <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> markup is to enclose multiple, related texts with the &#x3008;group&#x3009; element. 
                            Since this element can nest only within a &#x3008;TEI&#x3009; document, 
                            and unlike &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; cannot itself contain a &#x3008;TEI&#x3009; document, 
                            the &#x3008;group&#x3009; element is too inflexible to accommodate <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>&#x02BC;s design for both single works and corpora or manuscripts. 
                            Single works are represented by multiple &#x3008;TEI&#x3009; documents&#x2014;typically, an apparatus, multiple witnesses and facsimiles, and glosses&#x2014;while 
                            corpora and manuscripts are also represented by multiple &#x3008;TEI&#x3009; documents, including an apparatus plus the sequence of works comprised by the collection 
                            (each work again consisting of its multiple &#x3008;TEI&#x3009; documents). An advantage that the &#x3008;group&#x3009; element holds over &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; 
                            is that the former is designed to accommodate a &#x3008;head&#x3009; element, which would more satisfyingly encode the title, 
                            <title type="anthology" corresp="#MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">&#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; [MS I Poetry Anthology]</title>, than what is shown in the sample markup above. 
                            Instead, using &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009;, either one must attach the anthology title as a &#x3008;head&#x3009; to the germane witness of the first item in the anthology, 
                            which is badly formed markup; or, as we have done above, one must insert the title as a separate <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> document. Arguably, however, 
                            the latter procedure is as well&#x2010;formed as it is valid in the frequent cases in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s titles and title pages 
                            refuse to conform to the structures that the &#x3008;group&#x3009; element was designed to describe. The &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; element more flexibly 
                            accounts for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s dynamic play with the relation between container and contained.</p>
                        <p>For example, in the originally blank, pre&#x2010;bound notebook that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> named 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref>, 
                            and that the Ruskin family knew as one of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref>, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> used the inside front endboard to make a title page for a text, 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</title></ref>, 
                            possibly intending the work, at least initially, to be coextensive with the entirety of the physical notebook 
                            (see <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php#TITLE"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</title>: Title</ref>, and 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php#TITLE">MS I: Title</ref>). Whatever his initial plan was, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            completed &#x201C;Volume I&#x201D; of this prose work without filling the notebook&#x2014;a terminus 
                            that he declared by inscribing &#x201C;end of harry and Lucy&#x201D;&#x2014;and he went on to extend the contents with an anthology, 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">&#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; [MS I Poetry Anthology]</title></ref>. 
                            This, too, reached a terminus, which he declared with a colophon:</p>
                            <ab type="colophon" rend="center">
                                The end<lb/>
                                <placeName corresp="#HERNE">hernhill</placeName><lb/>
                                <placeName corresp="#FOUNTAINST">fountain street</placeName><lb/>

                            </ab>
                        <p>The colophon reflects the play of closure by declaring a second ending&#x2014;the &#x201C;end of the poems&#x201D;&#x2014;specifying 
                            the end of the poetry anthology. This declaration was erased by somebody, using a rough pencil scratchout, 
                            perhaps in order to shift the emphasis to the end of a larger entity comprising 
                            <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">volume 1 of &#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title> plus the poetry anthology, 
                            <title type="anthology" corresp="#MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">&#x201C;Poetry&#x201D;</title>. The colophon had perceptibly altered the usage of &#x201C;volume&#x201D; 
                            on the title page of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title>, which was clearly meant to apply only to the prose work. 
                            Using the &#x3008;group&#x3009; element, which calls for a &#x3008;front&#x3009; element to contain frontmatter, one cannot represent a title page 
                            that is in flux. One cannot describe <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s dynamically developing ideas much more vividly using &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; 
                            or perhaps any other <title type="program" corresp="#XML">XML</title> element, but we strive at least not to misrepresent his ideas.</p>
                        <p>Our usage of &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; also permits description of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s manuscripts and corpora as collaborative or mediated documents, 
                            which were sometimes glossed by his parents. We do not know who scored through &#x201C;end of the poems&#x201D; in the colophon of 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref>, 
                            but it was certainly <persName corresp="#MR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s mother</persName> who inserted a gloss 
                            amid the poems making up <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">&#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; [MS I Poetry Anthology]</title></ref>. 
                            She wanted to date precisely her son&#x02BC;s beginning and completion of the manuscript. 
                            The determinacy of <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s gloss, with its definite &#x201C;this book begun&#x201D; and &#x201C;finished,&#x201D; 
                            competes with the ambivalent play of <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s closure 
                            (see <ref type="apparatus" target="mr_gloss_dating_msi_apparatus.php"><title type="gloss" corresp="#MRGLOSSMSI">Margaret Ruskin&#x02BC;s Gloss on the Dating of MS I</title></ref>). 
                            While not necessarily intended to impose her will on the manuscript, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s gloss gloss has in any case proved 
                            as ambiguous as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own colophon, 
                            since both are followed by a new work entered on the inside back endboard&#x2014;an emblematical drawing, 
                            <ref type="drawing" target="heights_of_wisdom_drawing_msi.xml">&#x201C;Heights of Wisdom, Depth of Fools&#x201D;</ref>, which 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> dated a few months later than <persName corresp="#MR">his mother</persName>&#x02BC;s gloss. 
                            Such play, whether including an edge of competitiveness or joy of collaboration, cannot be fully described in terms of an 
                            <title type="program" corresp="#XML">XML</title> structure; the dynamics of play can be interpreted and discussed only in the archive&#x02BC;s commentary. 
                            However, the contributions of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s parents are very often convincingly encoded as glosses, 
                            which are not in the same class as the editor&#x02BC;s explanatory and textual glosses that hang from and refer only to specific texts, 
                            but which form stand&#x2010;alone <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> documents (including their own apparatuses and transcriptions) 
                            referring to and forming part of the corpus as a whole.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; markup also easily allows for reordering corpora athwart manuscripts. In the case of 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php"><title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</title></ref>, 
                            an eclectic editorial approach was adopted both by <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> and by <persName corresp="#ETC">E. T. Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName> 
                            on the grounds that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> left extensive writing for the work in draft 
                            along with an ambitious outline for arranging and completing the work; however, prior to realizing that plan, he abandoned the fair copy, 
                            requiring copytext to be drawn from both the fair copy and the draft. <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> justified his approach in <date when="1891">1891</date> as follows: 
                            &#x201C;[A]s I find from a list at the end of . . . <ref type="apparatus" target="msviii_apparatus.php">[MS] VIII</ref>&#x201D; 
                            (i.e., the <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php">Proposed Table of Contents for the Account of a Tour on the Continent</ref>), 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> &#x201C;intended this volume [the <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX fair copy</ref>] 
                            to contain about 150 pieces of prose and poetry, and at least as many drawings! 
                            And in saying [in <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi>] that he did not follow his tour beyond the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>, <persName corresp="#JR">Mr. Ruskin</persName> 
                            refers only to this volume, <ref type="apparatus" target="msix_apparatus.php">No. IX</ref>,&#x201D; and not to what he had in fact composed. 
                            &#x201C;I am pretty certain that he was not aware of the amount of material existing in rough copies at the back of his book&#x2010;shelves&#x201D;

                            In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; is used to compile the respective edited corpora that conjecturally reconstruct <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s work: 
                            <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s, which includes only poems; <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s, 
                            which includes both poems and prose sections; and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s multiple versions of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, 
                            whereby he evolved the work from a poetic travelogue in collaboration with his father into a composite work of poetry, prose, and illustration.</p>
                        <p>Other compelling candidates for separately and eclectically edited corpora witnessing a composite work include a compilation of the &#x201C;volumes&#x201D; 
                            making up the uncompleted &#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D; narrative, 
                            drawn from <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref>,

                            in which the bonds between the sermon texts are stronger than their ties to the manuscripts in which the texts are found. 
                            While arguably the five handsewn booklets containing the fair copies of the sermons 
                            can be treated as a single corpus, the various <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref> 
                            containing rough drafts of the sermons present a particularly attenuated claim on the texts as composing a portion of their corpora considered as manuscripts. 
                            By the time <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> entered the sermon drafts in the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref>, 
                            these notebooks had been demoted to providing leftover, unused space for miscellaneous draft, and the sermon texts run reverso and upside&#x2010;down to what was once a vital corpus.</p>
                        <p>Yet another candidate for &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; markup to describe multiple and conjectural corpora are those that were compiled neither by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            nor his editors, but by members of his circle who were interested in creating anthologies for some special purpose. For example, in <date when="1831">1831</date> 
                            <persName corresp="#MR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s mother</persName> proposed that <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> 
                            make a small &#x201C;parcel&#x201D; of letters and poems to be shared with their intimate friends, the Grays. Such anthologies reveal assumptions 
                            about the intended audience of youthful writing in the nineteenth century (see <ref type="internal" target="#PRIVATE">The Private, Confidential, and Public in the Early Manuscripts</ref>).</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> thought about text in a manner that included the materiality of its presentation. 
                            If the title page and colophon of <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref>, 
                            as explained above in <ref type="internal" target="#TEICORPUS">&#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; Markup and the Tension between Works and Corpora</ref>, 
                            caused <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> perplexities in observing the parameters of text, the enigma lay partly in its textual corpus being co&#x2010;terminous 
                            with the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Book</ref> containing it. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, 
                            like many nineteenth&#x2010;century young authors, modeled his textual production on published texts; and the problem of what constituted &#x201C;Volume I&#x201D; of his 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title></ref> arose 
                            from his having borrowed that physical and textual division from the <date when="1825">1825</date> title page of 
                            <title type="book" corresp="#EDGEWORTHHARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED"><hi rend="italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded; Being the Last Part of Early Lessons</hi></title> 
                            by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="edgeworth_maria_note.php">Maria Edgeworth (1768&#x2013;1849)</ref>&#x2014;a title page that he imitated closely in its typography, 
                            while adapting its publication information to his own circumstances as a &#x201C;little boy&#x201D; who &#x201C;printed and composed&#x201D; and also drew&#x2014;and from his having 
                            conceived of his title page as referring to the space between the red leather covers of the notebook.</p>
                        <p>By pursuing that physical as well as textual imitation to small typographical features, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> invented marks 
                            that present the digital encoder with odd problems in markup. For example, in order to justify his hand&#x2010;printed text with the right margin, as in a printed book, 
                            he invented an end&#x2010;of&#x2010;line mark that resembles a hyphen, but that varies in length according to what is needed to fill out the physical measure of a line 
                            of text. To encode this mark as a hyphen would be misleading, whereas to ignore the mark altogether would be implicitly to assert that the materiality 
                            of text has no bearing on how we study and think about the youthful productions of nineteenth&#x2010;century authors. In this instance, <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> 
                            uses the <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> glyph element, &#x3008;g&#x3009;, assigning it the &#x0040;type &#x201C;justification&#x201D; 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#TRANSCRIPTION">Transcription and Encoding Procedures</ref>).</p>
                        <p>The policy of first&#x2010;pass transcription and encoding in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> is to ignore nothing in the physical witness that can reasonably be inferred as intentional. 
                            Even if we must temporize about solutions to encoding what we see, or revise earlier solutions in light of later and better schooled interpretations, it is inefficient and reckless 
                            to reserve such perplexities for later, after we have captured all the text that seems most &#x201C;significant&#x201D; (read: &#x201C;conventionally text&#x2010;like and interpretable&#x201D;). 
                            Thanks to this policy, we are constantly surprised. For example, we expected that the &#x201C;justification&#x201D; glyph would be required in the course of transcribing only the earliest 
                            and most naive texts, until we discovered <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> employing the end&#x2010;of&#x2010;line mark as late as <date when="1834">1834</date>

                            but not by abandoning materiality for text as abstraction; rather, he engaged with the forms of materiality in the publishing of his time, 
                            the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>, and prepared himself to come forward as an author of his decade by imitating new printing technologies, 
                            particularly the reproductive technologies used for images in illustrated travel writing 
                            (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HANSONRUSKIN1830S">Hanson, &#x201C;Ruskin in the 1830s&#x201D;</ref>). 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s abiding awareness of the materiality of textual production is why the emphasis on <hi rend="italic">manuscripts</hi> 
                            in the title of our archive is so important. The pre&#x2010;bound notebooks, ledgers, handsewn pamphlets, folded sheets, and other media for his early writing was always interesting to 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, engaging him as boundaries which he could both exploit as opportunities and resist as flexible barriers. 
                            This exhibition of engagement with the materiality of print culture lends a special kind of authority to the &#x201C;private&#x201D; or &#x201C;confidential&#x201D;

                            private and confidential manuscripts from those they employ in presenting public documents.&#x201D; <persName corresp="#DHR">Reiman</persName> defines these three categories,

                            but by &#x201C;the nature and extent of the writer&#x02BC;s intended audience. 
                            A manuscript is <hi rend="italic">private</hi> if its author intended it to be read only by one person

                        <p>As an example of a problematic editorial procedure that can arise from ignoring these distinctions between the private, confidential, and public, 
                            <persName corresp="#DHR">Reiman</persName> points to nineteenth&#x2010;century editions of <persName corresp="#PBS">Percy Bysshe Shelley</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            (<date notBefore="1792" notAfter="1822">1792&#x2013;1822</date>) poems that were arranged 
                            &#x201C;primarily by chronology, rather than by the author&#x02BC;s intentions.&#x201D; 
                            This organization resulted in indiscriminate mixing of <persName corresp="#PBS">Shelley</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;false starts and rejected fragments,&#x201D; 
                            which &#x201C;<persName corresp="#MWS">Mary Shelley</persName> (<date notBefore="1797" notAfter="1851">1797&#x2013;1851</date>) had so assiduously 
                            rescued from his draft notebooks,&#x201D; with his &#x201C;highly polished completed poems 
                            (with a few fragments) that [the poet had] released for publication.&#x201D; As a consequence, 
                            readers of these chronologically ordered editions inadvertently developed &#x201C;a less positive picture of <persName corresp="#PBS">Shelley</persName>&#x02BC;s intelligence&#x201D;

                        <p>Which of these definitions applies to juvenilia and youthful writing, which often imitates public forms&#x2014;even to the extent of mimicking 
                            the appearance of published documents&#x2014;but which, in practical terms, cannot have been intended for an audience beyond the family circle? 
                            In considering an example of juvenilia, <persName corresp="#JA">Jane Austen</persName>&#x02BC;s (<date notBefore="1775" notAfter="1817">1775&#x2013;1817</date>) 
                            <title type="book" corresp="#AUSTENVOLUMETHEFIRST"><hi rend="italic">Volume the First</hi></title> (begun ca. <date notBefore="1786" notAfter="1787">1786&#x2013;87</date>), 
                            <persName corresp="#DHR">Reiman</persName> proposes a special subcategory, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">polished</hi> private and confidential manuscripts,&#x201D; 
                            and frames the question regarding the intention of such artifacts in terms of manuscript authority. 
                            <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">Nineteenth&#x2010;century</date> juvenilia is a special case among manuscripts belonging to an &#x201C;age of printing&#x201D; 
                            when professional &#x201C;authors realized that their final manuscripts were way stations on the road to a perfected text, rather than the thing itself.&#x201D; 
                            For mature, professional writers in the industrial age of print, <persName corresp="#DHR">Reiman</persName> continues, &#x201C;the manuscript no longer carried 
                            the same textual authority that it once had, even when it represented the author&#x02BC;s final involvement in such matters as the orthography and punctuation 
                            of most of the text.&#x201D; Authors in the age of print sent &#x201C;their work to press . . . anticipating&#x2014;and in many cases hoping&#x2014;that changes in the text 
                            or its presentation [would] be introduced by the printers or the publishers.&#x201D; Not so manuscript &#x201C;poems or other compositions that were intended for the perusal 
                            of a few specific individuals&#x2014;in short, <hi rend="italic">private</hi> or <hi rend="italic">confidential</hi> documents&#x201D;&#x2014;that the author 
                            fair&#x2010;copied for limited distribution, but did not intend for publication. These kinds of artifacts, typical of nineteenth&#x2010;century juvenilia, 
                            bear authority comparable to that of scribal copies of pre&#x2010;modern manuscripts, which &#x201C;the writer never expected . . . to be superseded 
                            by a more authoritative printed text. Such a manuscript had to be more carefully prepared than a press copy, because it would neither be vetted by publisher&#x02BC;s 
                            readers and compositors nor corrected in proof&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#REIMANMODERNMANUSCRIPTS">Reiman, <hi rend="italic">Study of Modern Manuscripts</hi></ref>, 92, 93, 94&#x2013;95).</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#DHR">Reiman</persName> is referring to the authority of copytext; and he lists sensible measures for situating an artifact like 
                            <persName corresp="#JA">Austen</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#AUSTENVOLUMETHEFIRST"><hi rend="italic">Volume the First</hi></title> 
                            in the category of &#x201C;polished&#x201D; confidential or private manuscripts. 
                            In this particular case, &#x201C;since some neighbors and acquaintances whom [<persName corresp="#JA">Austen</persName>] disliked seem to have been targets of her satirical thrusts, 
                            the manuscript was clearly not intended to circulate beyond <persName corresp="#JA">Jane Austen</persName>&#x02BC;s circle of like&#x2010;minded intimates, 
                            who alone could understand the point of these barbs and share the humor of them&#x201D;

                            Similar evidence is available of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s carefully prepared fair&#x2010;copy manuscripts circulating among a close circle of admiring and sympathetic readers, 
                            such as the couple, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="gray_richard_note.php">Richard</ref> and

                            suggesting that, when <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>in his travels neared <placeName corresp="#GLASGOW">Glasgow</placeName>,

                            there survive fair copies in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand, and these were probably the manuscripts that <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> deemed presentable for perusal by initimate friends&#x2014;in

                        <p>What does this classification indicate for the &#x201C;different procedures&#x201D; that, according to <persName corresp="#DHR">Reiman,</persName> should be observed in editing and analyzing private or confidential 
                            manuscripts as compared with public? First, the class of manuscripts that derive authority from both their polished presentation and their confidential status 
                            suggests that readers perceived authority in the material artifact itself, which bore direct witness to the authority of the writer&#x2014;or 
                            of something about the writer. &#x201C;I let <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>s letters come just as he writes them,&#x201D; <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> explained to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> when enclosing their son&#x02BC;s letters inside her own, 
                            &#x201C;that you may not be misled in your judgment as to his hopes and feelings&#x201D; 
                            (<date when="1829-03-04">4 March 1829</date>, in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 1:185). 
                            <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> assumes a Romantic idea about writing as an open window to the writer&#x02BC;s expression, which if copied in her own hand 
                            would not only lose authority, but even potentially mislead the reader. 
                            There do survive copies of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s works in his parents&#x02BC; hands, but these are far less common than <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own fair copies; 
                            and it seems unlikely that what <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> wanted the Grays to &#x201C;see&#x201D;&#x2014;not just read&#x2014;would have been a fair copy in her own hand, 
                            which derived authority from her adult sophistication of punctuation, spelling, orthography, and the like. 
                            Rather, &#x201C;judgment as to [the child writer&#x02BC;s] hopes and feelings&#x201D; derived from an intimate experience and knowledge that were available 
                            only through the authoritative original artifact; and by virtue of the artifact&#x02BC;s materiality, 
                            this experience could be extended to a trusted confidential circle.</p>
                        <p>Evidence suggests that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> shared this sense of an intended confidential audience that, in <persName corresp="#DHR">Reiman</persName>&#x02BC;s defintion, 
                            was most likely &#x201C;personally known to or interested in the author.&#x201D;  
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s understanding of these conditions is indicated by his inclusion of a letter to the Grays&#x02BC; relation, 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="monro_robert_mrs_note.php">Mrs. Robert Monro</ref>, 
                            as part of <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus.php">MS II</ref>, a manuscript that he entitled &#x201C;vol 1&#x201D; of his &#x201C;Works.&#x201D; 
                            By including a letter to <persName corresp="#MONROROBERTMRS">Mrs. Monro</persName> as part of the handsewn pamphlet, which otherwise contains poems, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears implicitly to invite <persName corresp="#MONROROBERTMRS">Mrs. Monro</persName> to form part his confidential audience beyond the immediate family circle. 
                            The designation &#x201C;Works,&#x201D; moreover, attests to the significance of this production, both as a physical thing, a &#x201C;volume,&#x201D; 
                            and as an abstract promise of more to come.</p>
                        <p>It follows that, as an editorial procedure appropriate to a manuscript&#x02BC;s classification as a polished confidential production, 
                            an edition of <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date> juvenilia should include, as does <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, manuscript images; 
                            diplomatic, and not eclectic or otherwise &#x201C;corrected&#x201D; transcriptions of texts; 
                            and a thorough physical description of the manuscript. In <hi rend="italic">fin de si&#x00E8;cle</hi> editions of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early poems and prose, 
                            some interest in the physical manuscripts was attested by facsimiles of selected manuscript pages, 
                            although the basis of selection was rarely made evident, and the sparseness of such examples, which was doubtless legislated in part by cost, was probably also limited also 
                            the perception that such images satisfied curiosity rather than providing essential scholarly information. Manuscript facsimiles in these editions, 
                            like reproductions of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s drawings, were printed on heavier paper stock and bound only into the large&#x2010;paper, 
                            quarto collector&#x02BC;s edition of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)</title></ref>, 
                            and not in the inexpensive octavo editions. In the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title></ref>, 
                            manuscript facsimiles seem to gain scholarly purpose, but in fact the manuscripts selected for reproduction tend to be as random and lacking in context 
                            as those in <persName corresp="#GA">George Allen</persName>&#x02BC;s collector&#x02BC;s editions of the youthful writing published in the <date notBefore="1890" notAfter="1899">1890s</date>. 
                            The early editors did supply descriptive bibliographies of the manuscripts, but the descriptions were limited in detail; and as argued above in 
                            <ref type="internal" target="#DEFINING">Defining <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Manuscripts</hi></ref>, lost even more coherence and consistency 
                            in the transition from <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)</title> to the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>.</p>
                        <p>While there was a perception among late&#x2010;Victorian editors, then, that the confidentiality of early writing needed to be represented through its artifactual status&#x2014;allowing 
                            a child&#x02BC;s manuscripts to &#x201C;come just as he writes them,&#x201D; as <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> suggested, in order that the reader may form a 
                            &#x201C;judgment as to [the child&#x02BC;s] hopes and feelings&#x201D;&#x2014;editors apparently believed that they met such a need by supplying a few facsimiles 
                            in &#x201C;large&#x2010;paper&#x201D; editions as curiosities for specialized collectors. Once the readership was widened beyond collectors to include the anonymous, 
                            public consumption of a &#x201C;common&#x201D; edition, such curiosities were dropped, and the editor&#x02BC;s duty remained only (in both common and collectors&#x02BC; editions) to 
                            intervene heavily in the texts in order to &#x201C;improve&#x201D; them according to a public standard of uniform punctuation and formal decorum. 
                            As <persName corresp="#CAA">Christine Alexander</persName> comments, in late&#x2010;Victorian editions 
                            of nineteenth&#x2010;century authors&#x02BC; juvenilia, heavy&#x2010;handed &#x201C;improvement&#x201D; of texts was typical of editorial approaches 
                            to what were condescendingly termed an author&#x02BC;s juvenile &#x201C;effusions.&#x201D; 
                            <persName corresp="#CAA">Alexander</persName> somewhat overstates the case that these &#x201C;poorly transcribed, bowdlerized and &#x2018;improved&#x2019;&#x201D; texts 
                            wholely &#x201C;reinforce the attitude of inferiority towards early works and show the kind of 
                            disrespect for childhood that was common well into the twentieth century&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ALEXANDERDEFINING">Alexander, &#x201C;Defining and Representing Literary Juvenilia&#x201D;</ref>, 84, and see 81&#x2013;84), given that 
                            this attitude was tempered to some extent by editors&#x02BC; acknowledgement 
                            of the special artifactual status that juvenile manuscripts held for their original, confidential readership. Nonetheless this materiality retained its value 
                            primarily among collectors and did not affect the the editor&#x02BC;s mission to improve the texts for a modern, anonymous audience.</p>
                        <p>In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> studies, thinking about distinctions between the private, confidential, and public in his manuscripts 
                            is complicated by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s invitation to view his writing as a window to his whole mind, an invitation rendered 
                            paradoxical by his simultaneous insistence on the Carlylean &#x201C;strength&#x201D; required to resist the pathetic fallacy. 
                            Famously, in <title corresp="#JRFORS"><hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi></title>, his open letters to &#x201C;workers,&#x201D; 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> declared that his private letters could be read aloud from the housetops: &#x201C;I never wrote a letter in my life 
                            which all the world are not welcome to read, if they will&#x201D; (letter 59); or, as he expressed the idea more colorfully to the artist, 
                            <persName corresp="JSARTIST">James Smetham</persName> (1821&#x2013;89): &#x201C;I never wrote a private letter to any human being 
                            which I would not let a bill&#x2010;sticker chalk up six feet high on <placeName corresp="#HYDEPARK">Hyde Park</placeName> wall, 
                            and stand myself in <placeName corresp="#PICCADILLY">Piccadilly</placeName> and say &#x2018;I said it&#x2019;&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 28:449, 14:462). 
                            Looking to the juvenilia for the origins of this position, one wonders if this reckless intimacy was born of necessity, 
                            since <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> carried samples of <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s letters on 
                            his travels, perhaps ready to show them to any interested stranger. We can only speculate about such causes, but the result seems to have been a collapsing 
                            of private, confidential, and public into a single category, whether in his youthful or mature writing. The difference between the juvenilia and mature writing is that, 
                            whereas one can usefully parse the mature writing in terms of <persName corresp="#DHR">Reiman</persName>&#x02BC;s distinctions based on authorial intentions about audience,
                            and yet trace a commonality of autobiographical impulse connecting these differing kinds of works, the whole span of youthful writing seems almost indistinguishable 
                            in terms of authorial intention about <hi rend="italic">audience</hi>, while an autobiographical register is typically (albeit not universally, in all works) 
                            submerged below the level of detectable intention. In the manuscripts of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s mature writing, 
                            readers tend to look for private emotion universally, even when these manuscripts can be logically and usefully 
                            sorted as private, confidential, and public; in the early writing, readers are presented with a wide range of theatrical, performative emotion, 
                            but private emotion is much less easily detectable as an intention and must be read by the other means that <persName corresp="#DHR">Reiman</persName> 
                            believes to be misleading for distinguishing the public or confidential from the public&#x2014;the rhetoric of the work, and the depth of the writer&#x02BC;s relation to the person addressed.</p>
                        <p>As <persName corresp="#RBRETON">Rob Breton</persName> remarks, much of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;early verse is notable for its emotional distance and detachment, 
                            despite the intimate, spontaneous, garrulous personae of the poet and the clear imitation of and inspiration from Romantic writing&#x201D;&#x2014;a quality 
                            of detachment consistent with <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s later theory of the pathetic fallacy. If in its &#x201C;refusal of emotion&#x201D; 
                            the early writing nonetheless points also to suppression of &#x201C;pychological burdens,&#x201D; 
                            then the writing often points to those burdens only in terms of their having been &#x201C;duly evaded.&#x201D; 
                            Yet <persName corresp="#RBRETON">Breton</persName> also observes that the detached quality of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            early writing &#x201C;complements&#x201D; an investigation into an opposite tendency in the youthful writing&#x2014;namely, 
                            the existence of private &#x201C;signs of &#x2018;psychological disturbance&#x2019;&#x201D; 
                            that, according to <persName corresp="#DCH">David Hanson</persName>&#x02BC;s reading, were &#x201C;likely caused by his mother&#x02BC;s disapproval of her son&#x02BC;s &#x2018;romantic&#x2019; instincts and devotion to poetry.&#x201D; 
                            It is unlikely that one can coordinate these opposite modes of expression&#x2014;private anger and resentment, and public detachment&#x2014;reliably with authorial intention 
                            respecting private, confidential, and public audience, since most pieces will appear to adopt the detachment appropriate to an imagined public 
                            (i.e., what <persName corresp="#DHR">Reiman</persName> terms &#x201C;polished&#x201D; confidential manuscripts). 
                            It is true that signs of psychological disturbance seems to emerge more consistently in rough&#x2010;draft works than in 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s fair&#x2010;copy manuscripts, 
                            but we do not know to what extent <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> kept the rough&#x2010;draft notebooks private. 
                            The presence of his father&#x02BC;s hand marking some drafts suggests that these notebooks were never secret. 
                            Ruskin&#x02BC;s intentions, therefore, will seem all but uniformly to point in the direction of &#x201C;polished&#x201D; confidentiality, 
                            as in much nineteenth&#x2010;century juvenilia, while proving a deceptive indicator of the emotional bearings of a work. 
                            Private emotion that jars with an intention of public address (or the imitation of public address) is more likely to be signaled by rhetorical or accidental features 
                            such as fragmentation. It is no accident that, even sixty years after their composition, fragmented works were banned from publication in 
                            <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s edition of the <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)</title>, 
                            such works having been deemed by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself or someone in his circle as holding &#x201C;&#x2018;too slight interest&#x2019;&#x201D; 
                            as <persName corresp="#CEN">Charles Eliot Norton</persName> would have said, but also as indicating what was &#x201C;&#x2018;too personal, too intimate&#x2019;&#x201D;

                        <!--The other possible indicator of a manuscript&#x02BC;s private, confidential, or public status that <persName corresp="#DHR">Reiman</persName> rejects 
                            in favor of authorial intention&#x2014;the writer&#x02BC;s personal or professional relation with the addressee&#x2014;tends to be of little use in 
                            analyzing almost any juvenilia since that relation will typically be limited to a confidential one. 
                            Nineteenth&#x2010;century juvenilia often calls for a biographical approach, which aligns the emotion suggested by a work with the writer&#x02BC;s 
                            pyschological relation with a specific family member. In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s case, some works explicitly concern 
                            emotional relations with one parent or the other, as in <ref type="apparatus" target="on_papas_leaving_home_apparatus.php">&#x201C;On Papat&#x02BC;s Leaving Home&#x201D;</ref>, 
                            and I have argued in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HANSONSELFANDREVISION">&#x201C;Self and Revision in Ruskin&#x02BC;s Revaluations of Romanticism&#x201D;</ref>, 
                            for example, that some works can be explained as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s angry response to his <persName corresp="#MR">mother</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            attempts to stem his poetry writing. Specific stories in the Bront&#x00EB; sagas, similarly, 
                            have been interpreted in terms of sibling rivalries. These biographical and psychoanalytic arguments about text can overlap with physical evidence in a manuscript 
                            that might be systematically transcribed and classified, such as signs of heavy revision combined with textual fragmentation. 
                            There is too little evidence, however, to link such features with the identity of specific readers in the Ruskin household. The hands of both <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName> and his <persName corresp="#MR">mother</persName> occur occasionally in the notebooks,  
                            and the fact that only his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName>&#x02BC;s hand appears in the rough&#x2010;draft notebooks 
                            may suggest that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> could control which parent viewed certain pieces, but such evidence cannot be verified.-->

                        <p>Owing to what one stands to learn, then, from the historical, artifactual status of nineteenth&#x2010;century youthful writing as &#x201C;polished&#x201D; private or confidential writing, 
                            we adopt a documenary orientation to editing witnesses of works in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>. 
                            This approach contrasts with <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s editorial procedure in

                            &#x201C;The choice of copy&#x2010;text and the emendations made,&#x201D; from this standpoint, &#x201C;result from an aesthetic preference for forms found in various documents

                            as in the case of many of <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s aesthetic choices, the preferences result not from any documentary or historical evidence at all, 
                            but from the editor&#x02BC;s personal taste.</p>
                        <p>Juvenilia as a field of study privileges a documentary over an eclectic editorial methodology. The aim of documentary editing, 
                            as summarized by <persName corresp="#MJK">Mary&#x2010;Jo Kline</persName> and <persName corresp="#SHP">Susan Holbrook Perdue</persName>, 
                            is to represent &#x201C;artifacts inscribed on paper or a similar medium . . . whose unique physical characteristics and original nature 
                            give them special evidentiary value&#x201D;

                            In the <date notBefore="1985" notAfter="1987">mid&#x2010;1980s</date>, writing in the first edition of the <title type="book" corresp="#KLINEPERDUEDOCUMENTARY"><hi rend="italic">Guide to Documentary Editing</hi></title>, 
                            <persName corresp="#MJK">Kline</persName> could still generalize about a contrast between the documentary approach of historians and the &#x201C;literary editing&#x201D; theorized and practiced by 
                            textual critics and editors in English departments. In that same decade, however, such scholars as <persName corresp="#DFM">Donald McKenzie</persName> and <persName corresp="#JJM">Jerome McGann</persName> 
                            began to sway literary scholars toward a more sociological approach focused on study of the textual artifact in its cultural moment. 
                            Historians came meanwhile to recognize that, in their allegedly purist views of documentary editing, they have tended to overlook their own interventionist and &#x201C;literary&#x201D; practices

                            The study of juvenilia foregrounds the merits that historians have traditionally claimed 
                            for diplomatic editing of manuscript documents while also highlighting the difficulties of achieving purity in a diplomatic method.</p>
                        <p>Nineteenth&#x2010;century editors of the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> juvenilia apparently took for granted that readers would benefit by an editorial approach that was almost the opposite of documenting an artifact. 
                            From <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> and <persName corresp="#WHH">W. H. Harrison</persName> to <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName>, 
                            and to <persName corresp="#ETC">E. T. Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName>, the first editors of 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early writing freely and without acknowledgment regularized punctuation, invented titles, 
                            rewrote lines and reorganized stanzas of poetry, and joined fragments that are unrelated in the manuscripts to form texts that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> never wrote 
                            (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="history_of_bibliography_and_editing_note.php">History of the Bibliography and Editing of the Early Ruskin Manuscripts</ref>). 
                            In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, these heavily edited texts are now themselves treated diplomatically as witnesses to an older conception of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s youthful writing, 
                            bearing evidentiary value for how editors of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date> believed the boy should be &#x201C;brought forward&#x201D; as an author, 
                            and for how editors of the <date notBefore="1880" notAfter="1899">1880s and 1890s</date> perpetuated a myth of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s boyhood, 
                            formed largely by his autobiographical writing.</p>
                        <p>In twentieth&#x2010;century editing of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, even well before the advent of sociological approaches to literary editing, 
                            the orientation swung to a documentary method, prompted in part by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="viljoen_h_g_note.php"><persName corresp="#HGV">Helen Gill Viljoen</persName></ref>&#x02BC;s scorn for the methods 
                            of <persName corresp="#ETC">E. T. Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName> 
                            in the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title></ref>. 
                            (She was less willing to point out similar faults in the practices of <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName>.) Arguably, the 
                            <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> can be credited with favoring a more historical approach, 
                            with its policy of printing unpublished materials, albeit selectively and in heavily edited versions. However, a diplomatic approach to transcribing 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts became the norm only with the editorial labors of <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName>, 
                            whose <date when="1973">1973</date> edition, <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">The Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title>, 
                            influenced Victorian studies by the editor&#x02BC;s insistence on treating the entire family&#x02BC;s historical papers&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">family</hi> 
                            letters&#x2014;as requisite to scholarship, and not just <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s side of the correspondence as a literary accomplishment. 
                            <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> also attempted faithfully to reproduce the idiosyncrasies of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s punctuation, 
                            recognizing that one can detect the pulse of thought in his hand. Just as telling, for <persName corresp="#SE">Sheila Emerson,</persName> 
                            is the scarcity of punctuation in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early writing, which provides a window onto how he 
                            &#x201C;bound his phrases each to each&#x201D; and allowed &#x201C;their movement [to jam] back and forth in the mind&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GENESISOFINVENTION">Emerson, <hi rend="italic">Genesis of Invention</hi></ref>, 27). 
                            In effect, twentieth&#x2010;century editors of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> embraced diplomatic approaches in order to treat 
                            the reader as a confidante, as close as possible to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;hopes and feelings,&#x201D;, 
                            in the belief that those feelings are vividly and importantly legible in the holograph maunscripts.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>&#x02BC;s most passionate statement of this position occurs in his edition of the 
                            <title type="book" corresp="#WINNINGTONLETTERS"><hi rend="italic">The Winnington Letters</hi></title>
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s letters to the schoolmistress, <persName corresp="#MAB">Margaret Alexis Bell</persName>, and the girls at 
                            <placeName corresp="#WINNINGTON">Winnington Hall</placeName>. <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> urges that no edited substitute ultimately can capture the experience of reading 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in manuscript, where syntax and punctuation &#x201C;convey clearly the flow of his ideas and spirit at the moment of writing. 
                            His punctuation, while unconventional, is logical and expressive of the pause, pitch, and stress of his sentences.&#x201D; <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> admits doubt 
                            &#x201C;that print can reproduce the individuality of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s punctuation&#x201D;; 
                            and after a long paragraph entrancingly describing the meaning of every eccentric stroke, his regret is palpable that any endeavor by an editor 
                            &#x201C;to make the transcription of . . . [<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s] punctuation as accurate as printing will permit&#x201D; 
                            can result only in a pale reflection of the experience of reading a <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> letter in manuscript. 
                            The most exacting documentary transcription, <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> declares, can &#x201C;never record the story told by his handwriting, which often reflects his moods,&#x201C; 
                            and he defies the &#x201C;printed page [to] convey the pleasure of opening . . . [<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s] 4&#x00BD; by 2&#x00BD; inch 
                            envelopes, or unfolding his 4&#x00BD; by 7 inch (often double) sheets of blue, grey, or cream stationery&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WINNINGTONLETTERSINTRO">Burd, introduction to <hi rend="italic">Winnington Letters</hi></ref>, 84&#x2013;87).</p>
                        <p>In his edition of the Ruskin family letters, which followed four years later, <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> maintained his practice of a documentary 
                            system of transcription, but with a justification that was advanced in more historicized terms than the hope, 
                            as expressed in the introduction to <hi rend="italic"><title corresp="#WINNINGTONLETTERS">The Winnington Letters</title></hi>, 
                            of bringing the reader &#x201C;close to the flat table on which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote&#x201D;; rather, 
                            <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> more laconically proposed &#x201C;to preserve for the reader the pleasure of discovering . . . [the] 
                            original flavor&#x201D; of the Ruskins&#x02BC; correspondence, by resisting the editorial impulse to impose 
                            &#x201C;a formality which the writers never intended&#x2014;and to which some of them were never educated&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WINNINGTONLETTERSINTRO">Burd, introduction to <hi rend="italic">Winnington Letters</hi></ref>, 88; 
                            <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFLINTRO">Burd, introduction to <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 1:xlv). 
                            In this pattern of basing an approach to manuscript transcription, at first, on an imagined intimacy with a writer and then on a more historicized rationale, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> studies reflects a larger context of manuscript and book collecting, 
                            whereby late&#x2010;Victorian collectors sought &#x201C;modern&#x201D; (i.e., nineteenth&#x2010;century) first editions on grounds of the &#x201C;sentiment&#x201D; 
                            that these copies sponsored of a personal connection with a writer&#x2014;a 
                            sentiment that writers on collecting often figuratively expressed, as <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> later did, as if following 
                            the author&#x02BC;s hand on his writing table. Subsequently, the New Bibliographers of the <date notBefore="1930" notAfter="1939">1930s</date> rejected 
                            such sentiment in favor of more &#x201C;objective&#x201D; approaches 
                            (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.php">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</ref>; 
                            and <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SENTIMENTANDMATERIALITY">Hanson, &#x201C;Sentiment and Materiality in Late&#x2010;Victorian Book Collecting&#x201D;</ref>). 
                            In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> studies, a sentiment of intimacy with the author through collecting or manuscript study seems to have persisted longer, 
                            perhaps because <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself sought such immediacy of connection with audiences, and because more than other authors he acknowledged the act and materiality of writing and not just text, 
                            whether as dramatized in <title corresp="#JRFORS"><hi rend="italic">Fors Claivigera</hi></title> by the act of writing nearly thwarted by piercing steam whistles, 
                            or as represented in <title corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> by a facsimile of his boyhood writing for whatever it might reveal about his youth. 
                            Added to this encouragement by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to think about his writing as a physical act was the historical accident 
                            of manuscripts remaining at <placeName corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName> for discovery by <persName corresp="#HGV">Helen Gill Viljoen</persName> 
                            prior to their dispersal in the estate sale&#x2014;an experience that made her suspect of any form of editorial intervention that might work as a conspiracy 
                            against <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s ideas. Likewise <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, 
                            at least at the start of his career in the introduction to <title corresp="#WINNINGTONLETTERS"><hi rend="italic">The Winnington Letters</hi></title>, 
                            jumps quickly from the record of past editors&#x02BC; attempts to regularize <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s punctuation and grammar 
                            to an accusation that what past editors truly sought was to suppress (quoting <persName corresp="#CEN">Charles Eliot Norton</persName>) 
                            the &#x201C;&#x2018;too personal, too intimate, or of too slight interest&#x2019;&#x201D;

                                (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 1:xxiii)&#x2014;but because 
                                the relative neutrality of the term <hi rend="italic">early</hi> offers the advantage of leaving questions open for investigation. 
                                <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> has been launched at a time when juvenilia studies have been drawing greater curiosity than perhaps ever before; 
                                nevertheless, pejorative views of major authors&#x02BC; childhood writing have a deep history, not least among the authors themselves in their maturity, 
                                and one aim of the archive is not just to combat these prejudices, but to examine the prejudice as a critical problem.</p>
                            <p>For example, a debate formed around the fin de si&#x00E8;cle practice of collecting the juvenilia of &#x201C;modern&#x201D; 
                                (i.e., <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date>) authors, a practice that arose from a larger aim 
                                of compiling collections of modern authors that aimed at comprehensiveness, including the acquisition of every &#x201C;minor&#x201D; publication such as juvenilia. 
                                The debate, which challenged the significance of what were deemed &#x201C;minor&#x201D; publications and deplored the effect of collecting these on the rare book market, 
                                spilled over into scholarly arguments about appropriate bibliographical approaches to these writers&#x02BC; canons. Much rancor arose over a perceived threat 
                                posed by this collecting, especially of juvenilia, to established literary authority and the control exercised over a literary corpus by an author or by the author&#x02BC;s family 
                                (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.php">The Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</ref>; 
                                and <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SENTIMENTANDMATERIALITY">Hanson, &#x201C;Sentiment and Materiality in Late&#x2010;Victorian Book Collecting&#x201D;</ref>). 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collecting held a singular position in this debate, for whereas many authors expressed embarrassment 
                                about their literary juvenilia, and reacted angrily to collectors seeking out early publications, and even prosecuted publishers and editors 
                                who supported this collecting fashion, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appeared to sanction this curiosity. As he wrote in

                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was willing to risk &#x201C;whatever charge of folly may come on me&#x201D; by printing the

                                since &#x201C;the weak little rhyme already&#x201D; demonstrated &#x201C;all that I ever could be, and all that I cannot be&#x201D;

                                as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> surely knew; and like other writers, he reacted with skepticism when listings of his earliest published writing 
                                became the foundation of one of the first comprehensive, single&#x2010;author bibliographies, which began appearing in the 
                                <date notBefore="1860" notAfter="1879">1860s&#x2013;70s</date> as finding aids for rarities sought by collectors 
                                (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="bibliography_of_ruskin_shepherd_note.php"><hi rend="italic">Bibliography of Ruskin</hi> (1878&#x2013;81)</ref>,

                                whereas <persName corresp="#ALT">Alfred Tennyson</persName> and <persName corresp="#RB">Robert Browning</persName> abused such collectors&#x02BC; publications 
                                and hounded the editors and publishers who reprinted their early writings with criminal prosecution for piracy, 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> chose to compete with this publishing phenomenon by appointing young men in his inner circle, 
                                such as <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName>, 
                                to edit these ephemeral pieces under his own supervision.</p>
                            <p>The poem <ref type="apparatus" target="glenfarg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glenfarg&#x201D;</title></ref> 
                                may or may not be a &#x201C;weak little rhyme,&#x201D; but the significance that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was prepared to bestow on it 
                                indicates the difficulty of winnowing a corpus of early writing by identifying the chaff on grounds of literary quality. For some, 
                                this difficulty only justifies their low opinion of juvenilia studies, but these exclusionary policies often carry a hidden agenda that proves 
                                at least as interesting historically as the allegedly minor writing that such policies disqualify for serious study. 
                                <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> believed that the scope of materials included in the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> 
                                was determined by the guarded decorum of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s inner circle&#x2014;a policy, namely, 
                                that &#x201C;nothing should be made public which might reflect adversely, from [the editors&#x02BC;] point of view, 
                                either upon <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> or upon any member of the family&#x201D;; and also (and potentially contradictorily) that 
                                &#x201C;all that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> said autobiographically, especially in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, 
                                about his life and that of his parents should be given unqualified editorial support&#x201D;

                                of what many perceived, at the time of its publication, as the scandalous inclusiveness of the edition,<!-- FILL OUT WITH DEARDEN --> specifically defined omissions 
                                in these late-Victorian can prove revealing. As I have argued elsewhere, the limits that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> 
                                observed in his edition of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early poems,

                                by agreeing to publish only &#x201C;completed&#x201D; works (a ban imposed possibly by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself, or by his caretakers, 
                                the Severns, or by his literary executors) had one effect of suppressing fragmentary expressions of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s

                                of editorial apparatus, <persName corresp="#EW">Wilson</persName> was goaded to a significant extent by his belief that these sophisticated editorial projects 
                                were funded at the expense of his own plan &#x201C;for an American equivalent of the Pl&#x00E9;iade series of Gallimard&#x201D;&#x2014;what became the

                                Similarly, from the <date notBefore="1860" notAfter="1899">1860s through the 1890s</date>, beliefs about what constituted a national <hi rend="italic">literature</hi>, 
                                and about how it should be consumed, prompted negative reactions to the editing of juvenilia. Some opponents to the so&#x2010;called &#x201C;first edition mania&#x201D; 
                                were motivated by class snobbery against faddish enthusiasts and speculators who invaded rare book showrooms and caused prices for such &#x201C;minor&#x201D; works 
                                as juvenilia to balloon at the expense of valuing modern classics. More interesting is the intensely emotional resistance by authors themselves to the 
                                &#x201C;resurrection&#x201D; of their juvenile works by editors and bibliographers&#x2014;the term <hi rend="italic">resurrection</hi>
                                referring to the illicit exhumation of bodies, and evoking the horror that authors and the literary establishment expressed regarding the 
                                &#x201C;vampiric&#x201D; ravages of editors who sought to reprint juvenilia. In this context, it is worth investigating why <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                                did not share the hostility toward &#x201C;resurrection men,&#x201D; but rather hastened to trump their excavations by reprinting his own fugitive pieces, 
                                and even welcomed a &#x201C;charge of folly&#x201D; for printing a juvenile poem. For <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>,

                                As <persName corresp="#CAA">Christine Alexander</persName> and <persName corresp="#JMCM">Juliet McMaster</persName> comment, 
                                owing to the pejorative connotations of the term <hi rend="italic">juvenilia</hi> in literary criticism, the supposed end&#x2010;point of an authors&#x02BC; 
                                &#x201C;apprentice&#x201D; work tends reflect backward on the early writing in negative terms, whether the transition is conceived as a successful 
                                or as an unsuccessful rite of passage. The separation between the Bront&#x00EB; sisters&#x02BC; early writing and mature novels has been treated 
                                by some critics as a &#x201C;problem&#x201D; in a derogatory sense, with the <hi rend="italic">juvenile</hi> understood to persist as a kind of infection 
                                into the later work. On these grounds, <persName corresp="#PBB">Branwell Bront&#x00EB;</persName> (1817&#x2013;48) has been permanently infantilized 
                                by some critics who regard all of his work as &#x201C;juvenilia&#x201D; despite his living and writing until age thirty&#x2010;one

                                Of writers of our own time, the dubious term was applied to the novelist <persName corresp="#PKF">Penelope Fitzgerald</persName> (1916&#x2013;2000)

                                Amid these critical confusions, of which the slippery use of the term <hi rend="italic">juvenilia</hi> is symptomatic, nineteenth&#x2010;century 
                                ideas of a writer&#x02BC;s or artist&#x02BC;s emergence need to be historically defined and situated, as <persName corresp="#CBOCK">Carol Bock</persName>

                            <p>Another rite&#x2010;of&#x2010;passage genre to be explored in nineteenth&#x2010;century juvenilia is the &#x201C;farewell,&#x201D; 
                                a self&#x2010;conscious parting of ways with the writing of one&#x02BC;s youth, particularly as modeled on some popular form such as Byronism. This rite of passage 
                                is epitomized by <persName corresp="#CBW">Charlotte Bront&#x00EB;</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="essay" corresp="#BRONTEFAREWELL">&#x201C;Farewell to Angria&#x201D;</title> (ca. <date when="1839">1839</date>), 
                                in which <persName corresp="#CBW">Bront&#x00EB;</persName> takes leave fondly and reluctantly, but with some relief, of her fictional world of <placeName type="fictional" corresp="#BRONTEANGRIA">Angria</placeName>, 
                                which she represents in this essay as a gallery of landscapes and portraits in varying seasons and moods 
                                (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BRONTESTALES">Alexander, ed., Bront&#x00EB;s, <hi rend="italic">Tales</hi></ref>, 314, 557). 
                                Bront&#x00EB; was relinquishing her Byronism at a high pitch of intensity in her engagement with this poetic trend 
                                (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ALEXANDEREARLYWRITINGS">Alexander, <hi rend="italic">Early Writings of Charlotte Bront&#x00EB;</hi></ref>, 192&#x2013;200). 
                                Her break was deliberate in <title type="essay" corresp="#BRONTEFAREWELL">&#x201C;Farewell to Angria&#x201D;</title>, exhibiting a self&#x2010;consciousness 
                                that perhaps makes this piece a rarity as a genre, rather than what might be found in other youthful writers as a tendency to detachment developing 
                                across a span of pieces of more routine imitativeness. If <persName corresp="#KC">Karen Chase</persName> is correct about the influence of Byronism 
                                on the Bront&#x00EB;s, however, a Carlylean break with Byronic romance was almost inevitable for promising young writers of the

                                early Byronism presented only &#x201C;eros without psyche,&#x201D; in which &#x201C;no Bildung&#x201D; could occur, because characters&#x02BC; 
                                &#x201C;personalties do not develop; they merely intensify&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CHASEEROSANDPSYCHE">Chase, <hi rend="italic">Eros and Psyche</hi></ref>, 15, 14). 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> likewise composed a Byronic romance in <ref type="apparatus" target="leoni_apparatus.php"><title type="story" corresp="#JRLEONI">&#x201C;Leoni&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                                but much of his poetic Byronism took the form, not of erotic tales and personae, but of landscape imagery, as if in realization of <persName corresp="#CBW">Charlotte</persName>&#x02BC;s metaphor 
                                place as landscapes and portraits suffused with Byronism in <title type="essay" corresp="#BRONTEFAREWELL">&#x201C;Farewell to Angria&#x201D;</title>. <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> 
                                contains several such fragmentary imitations of sublime landscapes that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> populates with &#x201C;spirits&#x201D; drawn from <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                                <title type="poem" corresp="#BYRONMANFRED"><hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi></title> as well as from <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s poems and tales, 
                                fragments in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s purpose was perhaps merely redundantly to intensify an effect. In making available all of these previously 
                                unpublished fragments, the benefit of <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>&#x02BC;s comprehensiveness prove only to demonstrate a boyish compulsion. If so, it is against these 
                                repetitious gothic landscape tropes that one may search for signs of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s break with Byronism&#x2014;a change typically

                            &#x201C;the transcriber&#x02BC;s goal is to make an informed decision about what is actually inscribed at each point&#x201D; in a manuscript, 
                            although of course editorial &#x201C;judgment is necessarily involved in deciding what is in fact present,&#x201D; 
                            &#x201C;as when an ambiguously formed character resembles two different letters.&#x201D; Despite these calls on editorial judgment, which must be notated, 
                            in a documentary editorial procedure the resulting &#x201C;text cannot simultaneously be unemended and emended&#x201D; 
                            since &#x201C;no single text&#x201D; can be both a transcription and a critical text; these &#x201C;are mutually exclusive genres&#x201D; of editing, 
                            although the same <hi rend="italic">edition</hi> might contain both transcriptions and emended, critical texts (pp. 201, 203).</p>
                        <p>For most works in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, the editor supplies documentary transcriptions of witnesses paired with facsimiles (if available) of those witnesses. 
                            The archive also provides, as it were, documentary transcriptions of past critical texts of works, because we believe that researchers will benefit 
                            by being able to study, in close proximity with accurate transcriptions of manuscript witnesses, how <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s first editors 
                            saw fit to represent those manuscripts to readers.</p>
                        <p>The editor is responsible for the accuracy of all transcriptions of witnesses in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, having taken most of them himself 
                            over several years from the original manuscripts in the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke Library</orgName>, <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale University</orgName>; 
                            the <orgName corresp="#BERG">Berg Collection, New York Public Library</orgName>; the <orgName corresp="#HUNTINGTON">Huntington Library</orgName>;

                            Later, the project acquired facsimiles in forms ranging from high&#x2010;resolution tiff files to microfilm, which have been used to confirm and improve on 
                            the editor&#x02BC;s original transcriptions, and to post in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> for the reader&#x02BC;s benefit. The editor is also responsible for final decisions 
                            about the interpretation of doubtful readings of manuscripts and for notating these decisions with textual glosses. In scattered instances, mostly involving manuscripts 
                            used to supplement annotation of the works contained in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, the editor initially had time in the physical archives 
                            only to describe a manuscript and gather information for a critical apparatus, and not to transcribe its contents completely; 
                            in those cases, we have sometimes been able to capture a transcription based on a high&#x2010;resolution facsimile. This procedure is noted where it occurs, 
                            with the expectation of later revisiting the physical manuscript.</p>

                            the research underpinning <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> would not have been possible. The editor is also grateful to the staffs of these libraries and archives, 
                            who shared their expertise and supported our research.</p>
                        <p>In the earliest stage of developing the digital archive beyond the research and writing, <persName corresp="#RGARSIDE">Roger Garside</persName>, 
                            formerly senior lecturer in the <orgName corresp="#LANCASTERUCOMPUTING">Department of Computing, Lancaster University</orgName>,
                            devised a helpful program for translating the editor&#x02BC;s word processing files into lightly <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName>&#x2010;encoded 
                            <title type="program" corresp="#XML">XML</title>, and for generating transformations in the form of <title type="program" corresp="#HTML">HTML</title> pages. 
                            This program was subsequently replaced as we elaborated our ideas about describing the early <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts 
                            with <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> markup, and also as we pursued a pedagogy for introducing students to <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> 
                            encoding and to designing and building online scholarly resources. <persName corresp="#RGARSIDE">Garside</persName>&#x02BC;s program, however, 
                            was foundational for helping us to envision the architecture of the archive. Meanwhile, to advance the Digital Humanities program at 
                            <orgName corresp="#SOUTHEASTERNU">Southeastern Louisiana University</orgName>, we benefited from consultation by <persName corresp="#SBAUMAN">Syd Bauman</persName>, 
                            <persName corresp="#MCHRISTY">Matthew Christy</persName>, <persName corresp="#JFLANDERS">Julia Flanders</persName>, <persName corresp="#LMANDELL">Laura Mandell</persName>, 
                            <persName corresp="#DPARKER">Dot Porter</persName>, <persName corresp="#LWOOF">Lawrence Woof</persName>, and the staff of the <date when="2005">2005</date> 
                            <orgName corresp="#NINES">NINES</orgName> Summer Workshop in Digital Scholarship at the <orgName corresp="VIRGINIAU">University of Viriginia</orgName>. 
                            <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> is indebted to these individuals and their institutions for their generosity and good will, 
                            which has persisted long beyond their respective workshops or consultations that got us started.</p>
                        <p>In the ongoing addition of new files to the archive, the following routines are observed by the encoding team. First, using the <orgName corresp="#OXYGEN">SyncRO Soft Oxygen</orgName> XML editor, 
                            encoders pull the word&#x2010;processed files of the editor&#x02BC;s original transcript(s) of a work, along with files of his apparatus and other annotation, 
                            into appropriate templates built for the varying document types included in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>. In a first pass, encoders mark up the editor&#x02BC;s original 
                            transcription and commentary according to the <title type="program" corresp="#TEIP5">TEI P5</title> standard; and the encoder checks the editor&#x02BC;s original transcript 
                            against its manuscript facsimile, querying any possible inaccuracies. Team members are instructed to confirm transcription of every deliberate mark on a manuscript, 
                            in whatever hand. As <persName corresp="#DLVM">Vander Meulen</persName> and <persName corresp="#GTT">Tanselle</persName> comment: &#x201C;Obviously a transcription 
                            cannot exactly reproduce the relative precision or carelessness with which handwritten letters are formed, or their relative sizes, or the amount of space 
                            between words and lines; but it can aim to record every ink or pencil marking of textual significance on the manuscript&#x2014;all letters, punctuation, superscripts, 
                            canceled matter, lines linking or excising passages, and so on&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#VANDERMEULENTANSELLETRANSCRIPTION">&#x201C;System of Manuscript Transcription&#x201D;</ref>, 201). 
                            We consider this aim, and nothing less, as defining the standard for first&#x2010;pass conversion of the editor&#x02BC;s original files, 
                            and for checking or completing transcription against its facsimile at this first stage, because it is impractical and an invitation to oversight to reserve some 
                            portion of transcription for a later stage. One can and should review the accuracy and thoroughness of transcription as often as one likes, but no systematic 
                            procedure for dividing a thorough transcription into stages would be practical, since one would have to redefine the procedure constantly in order to address 
                            the peculiarities of each manuscript.</p>
                        <p>To maintain consistency of markup in this process, the encoding team references a Encoding Guide, compiled by the supervising encoder, 
                            which lists every element, attribute, and value so far employed in the archive, and which is continually updated, as additional <title type="program" corresp="#TEIP5">TEI</title> 
                            elements and attributes or <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> values are discussed and added by the team. The team also constantly references and updates 
                            a project&#x2010;based Regularization Guide, which is a <title type="program" corresp="#MSEXCEL">Microsoft Excel</title> spreadsheet listing every 
                            <title type="program" corresp="#XML">XML</title> file name by category&#x2014;the names, that is, of files in the document&#x2010;type categories of 
                            apparatuses, manuscripts, witnesses, anthologies, drawings, essays, notes, and glosses. The Regularization Guide also lists all standardized editorial titles 
                            for these entities; and it serves as the encoders&#x02BC; crib for hex&#x2010;codes for special characters, <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>&#x02BC;s xml:ids for all proper names, 
                            titles, and bibliography entries used in the archive, the names used to identify hands, and dates and date ranges used to mark historical events. 
                            The team (mainly, in this case, the editor and supervising encoder) continually updates the Regularization Guide as new works, manuscripts, and commentary are added to the archive.</p>
                        <p>To manage workflow, the team uses the shared&#x2010;file system, <title type="program" corresp="#DROPBOX">Dropbox</title>, by <orgName corresp="#DROPBOXINC">Dropbox Incorporated</orgName>. 
                            Encoders work within their assigned <title type="program" corresp="#DROPBOX">Dropbox</title> folders, and for each <title type="program" corresp="#XML">XML</title> file 
                            they add their name and responsibility to the <title type="program" corresp="#TEIP5">TEI P5</title> header. When ready for review by more experienced encoders, 
                            the <title type="program" corresp="#XML">XML</title> file is moved (not copied) from the encoder&#x02BC;s folder and into another folder, 
                            in order to guard against accidental confusion and overwriting of files. The editor examines first&#x2010;pass encoding for accuracy, consulting both his notes 
                            from on&#x2010;site archival research and the facsimile. After the editor has reviewed a file, it passes to the supervising encoder for a final check 
                            of consistency with the <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> Encoding Guide and Regularization Guide and for a review of other matters of well&#x2010;formedness and validation. 
                            Finally, when the files have undergone transformation by <title type="program" corresp="#XSLT">XSLT</title> (written by the supervising encoder) and have been loaded 
                            onto the site, the editor reviews the live Web pages to confirm that the transformations have yielded the desired result and to search for any remaining typographical or encoding errors.</p>
                        <p>Not only is the team steadily adding new works and manuscripts to the archive, but also the editor is constantly researching and developing the commentary 
                            in apparatuses, notes, and glosses in order to increase the usefulness of the archive for researchers. At any given time, hyperlinks to notes are embedded 
                            in the <title type="program" corresp="#XML">XML</title> files that are presently inactive because the source notes are unfinished. 
                            When a source note is completed and added to the archive, any pre&#x2010;existing links to it should become active. All files are subject to revision and reloading 
                            with an appropriately updated version number.</p>

                        <p>Because editing in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> is documentary, we transcribe without correction <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s (remarkably rare) 
                            misspellings and grammatical errors. Also, we retain his capitalizations, ampersands, and unhyphenated spaces in such words such as <hi rend="italic">to day</hi>, 
                            <hi rend="italic">every day</hi>, <hi rend="italic">every one</hi>, and so on. If <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> omits letters from words, 
                            he usually does so to serve poetic meter. Since the reader can in most cases compare the edited typescript against the facsimile, 
                            the cause of an apparent anomaly will be evident (e.g., doubled letters arising from dividing a word between lines, or doubled words occurring before and after page breaks); 
                            nonetheless, potentially confusing anomalies and other distinctive manuscript features receive discussion in a textual gloss. 
                            Some of the most anomalous and challenging markup decisions are presented by the earliest juvenilia, in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> invented his own 
                            solutions for representing the print culture surrounding him.</p>

                            <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s handwriting, like that of any youth, changes and develops steadily over the course of time. 
                                In the years comprised by <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, one can observe his handwriting evolve from print lettering to cursive, 
                                and from an awkward cursive to a skillful command of a range of lettering styles, including a &#x201C;copperplate&#x201D; hand reserved for 
                                fair&#x2010;copying. We can watch him exchange a graphite pencil for pen and ink, and we can even detect evidence of his using a slate, 
                                although all direct traces of that stage of composition have of course vanished. In his fair copies, we can compare his imitations of print typefaces 
                                against models found in a range of trends broadly characterizing English books of the late eighteenth and eary nineteenth centuries as well as against 
                                typographic innovations specific to the historic moment of the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1839">1820s through 1830s</date>.</p>
                            <p>The <title type="program" corresp="#TEIP5">TEI P5</title> element used to establish the rudiments of these evolving skills, media, and cultural conditions 
                                is &#x3008;handShift&#x3009;, which carries attributes of &#x0040;script and &#x0040;medium, 
                                and to which we assign an xml:id based on the calendar year enclosing the manuscript in question&#x2014;the latter a somewhat arbitrary but functional organizing principle. 
                                For a detailed survey of these developments in and influences over <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand, see

                            <head type="sub-subsection">Justification, Runover, and Word Division</head>
                            <p>As discussed in <ref type="internal" target="#MATERIALITY">Expressing the Materiality of the Manuscripts</ref>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                                invented a mark to justify right and left margins in fair&#x2010;copy prose, which saved him from having to adjust space between words in a line of text. 
                                To fill the gap to the margin, he inserted a mark of variable length resembling a hyphen or a dash. Since it would misrepresent the mark&#x02BC;s purpose 
                                to encode it according to length as a hyphen, en&#x2010;dash, or em&#x2010;dash, we use a glyph element, assigning it a &#x0040;type &#x201C;justification&#x201D; 
                                as follows:<lb/>
                                <lb/>
                            <hi rend="center">&#x3008;g type&#x003D;&#x201C;justification&#x201D;&#x3009;-&#x3008;/g&#x3009;.</hi>
                            <lb/></p>
                            <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> often indicated paragraph breaks as minimally as possible. Whether because he meant to use space on a page efficiently, 
                                or because he liked the appearance of a more solid block of text, he often failed to indent a word beginning a new paragraph. The intention of a paragraph break 
                                can be signaled, despite the lack of indentation, by a significant gap between the end of a preceding line and the right margin, with no justification mark used 
                                to take up the slack. Sometimes, however, he fills such spaces with stars, like asterisks, and the following line still seems meant as a new paragraph. 
                                Signals become especially confusing when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> ends a block of text with a dash, which serves some rhetorical purpose 
                                such as an excited pause, and which would be indistinguishable from a justification mark apart from white space following it. In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, 
                                therefore, we insert paragraph breaks in a text when both sense and some definite scribal feature&#x2014;such as significant space at the end of a preceding 
                                line, and/or a rare indentation at the start of the next line&#x2014;seem to call for a new paragraph. If the manuscript evidence is ambiguous, 
                                the editorial decision is marked by a textual gloss.</p>
                            <p>We encode where line breaks fall in prose manuscripts, and we render these as breaks in the <title type="program" corresp="#XSLT">XSLT</title> transformation, 
                                so that prose witnesses match their facsimiles. In poetry, if <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote an extension of a line as a runover, 
                                the line&#x2010;break element &#x3008;lb/&#x3009; is inserted at the start of the runover text within the transcribed line, and the element is assigned a 
                                &#x0040;type &#x201C;runover&#x201D;, thus:<lb/>
                                <lb/>
                                <hi rend="center">&#x3008;lb type&#x003D;&#x201C;runover&#x201D;/&#x3009;&#x3008;space quantity&#x003D;&#x201C;00&#x201D; unit&#x003D;&#x201C;chars&#x201D;/&#x3009;.</hi>
                                <lb/>
                                Here the &#x3008;space&#x3009; element quantifies the number of characters that the runover is indented from the left text margin. 
                                (In <title type="program" corresp="#XSLT">XSLT</title> transformation, the runover also renders as an interlineation.)</p>
                            <p>In some cases of line runover in poetry, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> also signaled the runover with a mark apparently of his own 
                                invention, which in some places resembles an opening square bracket, and in others a vertical bar. Usually, he placed this mark at the start of the runover line. 
                                We tag this mark as a glyph element, &#x0040;type &#x201C;runover&#x201D;:<lb/>
                                <lb/>
                                <hi rend="center">&#x3008;g type&#x003D;&#x201C;runover&#x201D;&#x3009;[&#x3008;/g&#x3009;.</hi>

                                As an example of a runover using this mark, see the opening line of

                            <p>In the earliest juvenilia, those dating from <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1827">1826&#x2013;27</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                                had trouble writing commas and periods on the baseline, with the result that these marks float as if they were apostrophes or quotation marks. 
                                In some cases, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> anchors these with an insertion caret 
                                (see <ref type="internal" target="#DELETIONANDADDITION">Deletion and Addition</ref>),

                                In transcription, these floating marks are interpreted as conventional punctuation on the baseline.</p>
                            <p>In another idiosyncracy of punctuation, occurring throughout the early manuscripts and perhaps related to what <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName> 
                                has identified in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s mature hand as a <hi rend="italic">half&#x2010;comma</hi>, 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> inscribed what look like periods in the middle of sentences, 
                                where syntax calls for commas; and conversely, he wrote what look like commas as terminal punctuation at the end of sentences. 
                                This reversal, while not consistent, occurs regularly enough that the marks can be treated as glyphs. 
                                Thus, the mark is transcribed as the period or comma that its scribal appearance suggests, but the mark is tagged as a glyph, &#x0040;type &#x201C;terminal&#x2010;comma&#x201D; 
                                for what appears intended as terminal punctuation, 
                                and &#x0040;type &#x201C;pause&#x2010;period&#x201D; for what appears meant to indicate a pause, not a terminus.</p>
                            <p>As found likewise in letters written by all three members of the family, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> sometimes omits terminal punctuation and instead allows extra space 
                                between the end of one sentence and the start of the next. In these instances, the gap is encoded using the &#x3008;space&#x3009; element. 
                                However, if terminal punctuation is lacking, and no extra space is evident, we do not supply extra space where it does not exist, 
                                as <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> does in

                                in order to aid the reader&#x02BC;s eye.</p>
                            <p>If random flourishes and other marks in a manuscript appear to serve only decorative or doodling purposes, and no purpose of punctuation can be discerned, 
                                they are ignored in transcription and markup, apart from a textual note atesting to their presence.  
                            </p>
                       <!-- 
                        <p>In the earliest writing, Ruskin appears to have developed some  punctuation peculiar to himself—as obscure, 
                            in some instances, as his later mineralogical code symbols. In the first “Harry and Lucy” (no. 3), 
                            Ruskin ends sentences with a mark that might be a question mark or might be an exclamation point, 
                            and that seems to serve both of those functions. I have interpreted this mark similarly to my treatment of Ruskin’s comma and period reversal, 
                            using [?] for the mark when the sense calls for a question, and [!] for the mark in other cases.</p>
                        <p>As another system of his own in the earlier writing, especially in no. 3, Ruskin added closing quotation marks only to the ends of paragraphs, 
                            never paired with opening quotation marks. Not all the paragraphs with closing quotation marks are dialogue, 
                            and not all dialogue paragraphs have quotation marks. I suspect either that Ruskin misunderstood the symbol as indicating the end of a paragraph, 
                            or that he just liked the mark’s appearance. In either case, the mark would be best omitted altogether in transcription; 
                            however, I have retained it, since another reader might make better sense of it.</p>
                        <p>Still more bizarre is Ruskin’s doubled period, which he uses in the second “Harry and Lucy” (no. 20) and still more frequently in “Eudosia” (no. 27). 
                            The mark certainly does not indicate an emphatic stop; the opposite is more likely, a two-point ellipsis suggesting a slight pause, 
                            in the way a dash would normally be used. Ruskin may have needed to invent his own sign to function as a dash, 
                            since he used dashes and hyphens for another purpose, namely, to fill out and “justify” lines. 
                            In nos. 20 and 27, a bracketed dash [—] is used in place of Ruskin’s double period (..).

                                such as that marked up (using typographical symbols) in

                                albeit limited to the genetic development of a single witness. (A genetic reconstruction of a work&#x02BC;s development using all available draft and fair&#x2010;copy witnesses 
                                is presented discursively in the work&#x02BC;s apparatus.) In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> Showcase, using the Transcription Toggle 
                                on the toolbar (the curved arrow), the reader can view at stage one (indicated on the toggle arrow by its first third being highlighted) 
                                the earliest textual state of a given witness, with text that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> later deleted appearing gray. 
                                At stage two (indicated on the toggle arrow by two&#x2010;thirds being highlighted), the reader views the second state of text, 
                                with the added text replacing the deletion. In stage three (indicated by the toggle arrow being fully highlighted), the reader views 
                                deletions and additions simultaneously&#x2014;that is, the final state of the manuscript witness, as it presently appears&#x2014;with additions appearing above, 
                                below, or overlapping with the (grayed&#x2010;out) deletions, as the case may be.</p>
                            <p>In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, addition and deletion is not marked up as a single act, using the substitution element (&#x3008;subst&#x3009;), 
                                except in cases of overwriting, which cannot be otherwise interpreted. In many instances of deletion followed immediately by a word 
                                that makes sense of the passage, or with such a word placed above or below the line, no other scenario than an immediate substitution seems probable&#x2014;particularly 
                                if the change is reflected in a subsequent fair copy. But we leave these inferences to the reader, relegating our own interpretations to a textual gloss or the apparatus.</p>
                            <p>In the earliest extant juvenilia, a form of erasure and substitution is to allow a mistaken character to stand (or to be erased imperfectly), 
                                but to follow that character with a heavily inscribed character, as if the latter were in boldface, in order to emphasize the substitution.

                                uses marginal symbols to instruct the transposition of two lines from one place in the draft to another place&#x2014;a meaning for the symbols that is confirmed 
                                by his carrying out the transposition in a later fair copy of the poem. We encode <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s symbol for the point of insertion, 
                                an asterisk, with the element &#x3008;metamark&#x3009;, with its &#x0040;function designated in this case as &#x201C;insertion&#x201D;; and we encode the lines to be transposed, 
                                which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> brackets in the margin, as a span of text. This is a striking, early instance of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                                using symbols that function in the way defined by <title type="program" corresp="#TEIP5">TEI P5</title> for &#x3008;metamark&#x3009; &#x2014;to encode a scribal feature in a manuscript that does not form a part of the 
                                work, but that functions as a direction for how to read the text.</p>
                            <p>All metamarks require an editorial gloss to confirm or speculate about their meaning. In general, it seems, the earlier a possible metamark, the more ambiguous its intention, 
                                and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> is more likely to use a word rather than a symbol. In <date when="1827">1827</date>,

                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> inscribed a word, <hi rend="italic">bad</hi>, which might be tagged as a &#x3008;metamark&#x3009;, but its &#x0040;function and &#x0040;target 
                                could not be specified with certainty. That <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intended the word as metadiscourse seems evident in its isolation, placed on the same line 
                                as a runover text without its forming a part of that runover in sense or grammar. We can speculate that he intended this negative judgment as a directive to reject the poem's strophe 
                                and replace it with another that follows; however, in this and any such ambiguous instance, we can only encode the word or symbol as a &#x3008;metamark&#x3009; 
                                without confidently supplying a &#x0040;function or &#x0040;target. Rather, we can only discuss a possible function and target in a textual gloss and/or

                                called <hi rend="italic">notes</hi>, which are free-standing and hyperlinked throughout the archive.
                                (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="plan_of_archive_note.php">Plan of the Archive</ref>). As the term implies, 
                                explanatory glosses contextualize specific passages in a work&#x2014;too specific to be annotated with a &#x3008;note&#x3009; that would be 
                                accessible by hyperlink througout the edition. A textual gloss draws attention a specific textual or bibliographical feature of a witness.</p>
                            <p>Explanatory and textual glosses are accessed through clickable callouts embedded directly in the text. The callouts appear in a different color than 
                                that of the surrounding text; and explanatory gloss callouts are sequenced in arabic numerals, while textual gloss callouts are sequenced by lowercase letters.</p>
                            <p>While it is typically recommended in print editions that such annotations be referenced by line number in order to maintain a clear text, 
                                without the clutter of note callouts (see, e.g., 
                                <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#KLINEPERDUEDOCUMENTARY">Kline and Perdue, <hi rend="italic">Guide to Documentary Editing</hi></ref>, 117), 
                                two factors render embedded callouts more practical in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>. First, because the archive preserves the separate integrity of multiple witnesses 
                                of a work, a gloss must be capable of hyperlinking to the same or similar string of characters found in more than one witness, 
                                without regard to differences between witnesses in line numbering. Second, because the archive preserves the evidence of 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own line numbering, which he applied to some witnesses, annotation callouts need to work independently 
                                that numbering, which is often confused or erroneous.</p>
