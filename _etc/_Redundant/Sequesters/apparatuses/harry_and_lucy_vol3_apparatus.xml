                            has only &#x201C;4 days&#x201D; to finish his poem <title type="poem" corresp="#JRABATTLEIRREGULARMEASURE">&#x201C;A Battle&#x201D;</title> before &#x201C;entering
                        upon another year&#x201D; (i.e., <date notBefore="1828-12-28" notAfter="1828-12-31">December 28&#x2013;31</date>, or possibly <date notBefore="1828-12-29" notAfter="1829-01-01">December
                        29&#x2013;January 1</date>). The poem was completed in time, despite the
                        particularly elaborate fair&#x2010;copying in a special &#x201C;double print&#x201D;
                        lettering (see no. 33). This style of lettering was used also for
                        the capital letters and arabic numerals in the first three pages
                        of <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title> (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIIIA">MS IIIA</title>). From page four, the fancy
                        lettering was abandoned, presumably because time was growing
                        short before New Year&#x02BC;s, and, in the end, the project was left
                        unfinished altogether, both in draft and fair copy.</p>
                        <p>Sources and Background.&#x2014;Although the beginning of the
                        narrative is connected perfunctorily with the <date when="1827">1827</date> homeward trip
                        from <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> at end of no. 20, the main business of this last
                        volume of <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title> is to describe <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">&#x201C;Harry&#x02BC;s&#x201D;</persName> activities at
                        home during <date notBefore="1828-09-22" notAfter="1828-12-21">autumn 1828</date>. While the first volume of <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and
                        Lucy&#x201D;</title> was the most derivative of Edgeworthian scientific projects
                        and the second volume devoted mainly to travel, this third volume
                        is the most domestic, with <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">&#x201C;Harry&#x201D;</persName> rehearsing his daily
                        activities at <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName>. The role of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">&#x201C;Lucy&#x201D;</persName> has probably been
                        assumed by <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cousin from <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>, who had
                        arrived in the household by mid&#x2010;July, orphaned by her mother&#x02BC;s
                        death (TLC, 7).</p>
                    <p>The narrative and its presentation are as obsessive as
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s New Year&#x02BC;s poem with its double lettering. This <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry
                        and Lucy,&#x201D;</title> unlike the two earlier volumes, is unenlivened by
                        &#x201C;plates,&#x201D; although the narrative does mention drawing a good
                        deal. Instead of plates, the volume is burdened with lists,
                        including such pedantry as a list of &#x201C;errata&#x201D; consisting of only
                        one erratum&#x2014;and that single erratum is not really erroneous.
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> has ruled the paper, not only vertically for justifying
                        the margins, but also horizontally for regulating the ascenders
                        and descenders of his letters. In previous <title type="manuscript" corresp="JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title>, the
                        lettering sizes had varied widely.</p>
                        <p>The story opens with <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> punctiliously scheduling times
                        for his &#x201C;various employments,&#x201D; which now include instructing <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName>
                        in the constellations before breakfast. If <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> really did
                        subject his cousin <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> to this numbing exercise, his priggish
                        behavior may have been aimed at establishing dominance over the
                        newcomer to the household. The attitude may have been reserved
                        for female cousins, since male cousins, such as <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName> and
                        <persName corresp="#CTR">Charles</persName>, were regarded with reverence (see, e.g., no. 6).</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have owed his priggishness to <persName corresp="#MRC">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s
                        response to having to cope suddenly two children. While <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MAMMA">Mamma</persName> in
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s stories is always presented as the voice of order, in
                        the first volume she does not check <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName>&#x02BC;s energy, and
                        even rewards them for telling the truth when they cause mischief
                        (no. 3, chap. 3). By contrast, in the third volume, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> seems
                        preoccupied with reporting that &#x201C;he was to do&#x201D; this and &#x201C;had also
                        to&#x201D; do that. While <persName type="fictional" corresp="#JARRY">Harry</persName> remains as active as ever, so much so
                        that he cannot finish his projects, there is a sense of screwing
                        down the hatches, a guarding against threats of disorder to &#x201C;our
                        peaceful home&#x201D; as in the poem <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEDEFIANCEOFWAR">&#x201C;Defiance of War&#x201D;</title> (no. 7), which
                        was written following cousin <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>&#x02BC;s departure and death.</p>
                    <p>In an unpublished passage of <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> summarizing his
                        cousin&#x02BC;s part in the &#x201C;ideal child&#x2010;life&#x201D; at <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>
                        combines condescension toward <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> with guilt over how she was
                        treated.</p>

                                    <p><persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName>&#x02BC;s entrance into its selfish narrowness which had she
                                        been either of less submissive nature, or of brighter
                                        intelligence, might have infused a healthier leaven into
                                        it, brought, instead, an extremely subtle element of evil
                                        in the difference of feeling with which my parents regarded
                                        her and me. They would have been greatly wiser in placing
                                        her at a good school: the girl would have been less
                                        indulged, indeed; but also, less mortified.&#x2014;as it was, her
                                        life passed between moments of checked affection and
                                        repressed indignation; my mother and she were really fond
                                        of each other, and in the main tenor of it, her life was
                                        happy,&#x2014;yet she continually felt herself degraded by
                                        grudged gifts, and neglected, though the object of
                                        reluctant care. My parents thought they did a generous duty
                                        by her in taking her with us always, on our continental
                                        journeys. But <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> had little curiosity and no enthusiasm,
                                        and would have been really happier in the natural and
                                        unvexed life she might have led in a Scottish village, than
                                        in being taken to see palaces and cathedrals on the outside
                                        seat. Her companionship with me, though never felt by me as
                                        an annoyance, was entirely spiritless and colourless: we
                                        neither helped, teazed, nor much pleased each other. On the
                                        whole, I liked better to have <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> with me in a walk than
                                        not,&#x2014;yet our talk was commonplace, and I should have seen
                                        more, and thought to better purpose, had I been with old
                                        Anne.</p>

                    <p>The increased rigidity should viewed in context of the

                    <p>It was the <placeName corresp="#CROYDON">Croydon</placeName> <persName corresp="#MBR">Mary</persName>, not her Scottish cousin, who
                        became a family byword for awkwardness and disruption. As <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>
                        himself notes, <persName corresp="#MBR">Mary Bridget</persName> was denied a place in the <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName>
                        household that <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s relations had sought for her, because

                        acquiesced to the snobbery: &#x201C;[my sister] <persName corresp="#BR">Bridget</persName>,&#x201D; <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> wrote
                        to her husband, &#x201C;feels much mortification that [her daughter]
                        <persName corresp="#MBR">Mary</persName> is not to have her home with us and has suffered greatly but
                        Mr. R[ichardson of <placeName corresp="#CROYDON">Croydon</placeName>, her husband] &#x0026; her brothers are

                        from <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s segue, earlier in this letter, from praising <persName corresp="#JJR">John

                        pecuniary suffering&#x201D; to praising him for &#x201C;the arrangements you
                        have made for <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</placeName>&#x201D; and thereby &#x201C;reliev[ing] me from a weight of
                        anxiety&#x201D; (emphasis added, 162). The two acts of charity are
                        unrelated, the latter referring to the <placeName corresp="#CROYDON">Croydon</placeName> relations, as
                        confirmed by Margaret&#x02BC;s comment, undoubtedly referring to her
                        own, poorer relations, that <persName corresp="#BR">Bridget</persName> &#x201C;says she cannot bear you  
                        should be at such expence but still she seems hurt that I should
                        feel her child such a burden&#x201D; (162&#x2013;63).</p>
                    <p>The charitable &#x201C;arrangements&#x201D; for the <placeName corresp="#CORYDON">Croydon</placeName> <persName corresp="#MBR">Mary</persName> must
                        refer to her schooling by a <persName corresp="#MISSW">Miss Williamson</persName>, to whom <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>
                        made payments at this time. This again is a source of confusion,
                        <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> assuming that the schooling was for <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> of <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL">RFL</title></ref> 157
                        n. 2, 164 n. 3); however, while the <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> cousin is known to have
                        attended this school in <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1831">1830&#x2013;31</date>, that fact proves only that the
