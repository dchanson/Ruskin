                            Collingwood drew on both Ruskin's manuscript fair copy and his draft,
                            but limited his selections to poetry, according to the parameters of the
                            1891 edition. The editors of the Library Edition reprinted Collingwood's
                            poetry texts and expanded them somewhat with additional verse taken from
                            Ruskin's draft, but Cook and Wedderburn's most notable additions were
                            Ruskin's prose sections for the work, revealing for the first time (in
                            published form) the composite genre of the "Account" (Works, 2:340-87).
                            Like Collingwood's solely verse version, Cook and Wedderburn's verse and
                            prose version is a reconstruction from fair copy and draft. To some
                            extent beyond the fair copy (see Ruskin, Works, 2:364 n. 1), that
                            reconstruction is conjectural.</p>

                        <p>See Discussion: Sources, for Ruskin's modeling of the "Account" on the
                            1830 illustrated edition of the topographical poem <hi rend="italic"
                                >Italy</hi> by Samuel Rogers, with engraved vignettes after drawings
                            by J. M. W. Turner, Thomas Stothard and Samuel Prout; and on the 1833
                            edition of lithographs by Samuel Prout, <hi rend="italic">Facsimiles of
                                Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany</hi>. Ruskin's manuscript fair
                            copy of his travelogue is contained in MS IX, which is divided into
                            sections, each entitled by a place name. In its way, Ruskin's fair copy
                            surpasses the ambitions even of its ekphrastic models, in that he
                            elaborating most sections, in prose as well as verse--not just one or
                            the other--and he illustrates each section with hand-drawn imitations of
                            the engraved vignettes and lithographs in the Rogers and Prout volumes.
                            The text is lettered in a careful copperplate-style hand--presumably all
                            by Ruskin, although copyists such as his mother, Margaret Ruskin, and
                            his cousin, Mary Richardson, may have had a hand in the copying, as
                            wel--and the vignettes are drawn in pencil and/or pen and ink on
                            separate paper, which was then cut and pasted into place in MS IX.
                            Ruskin copied some scenes for his vignettes directly from his sources,
                            while for others he invented the scene but realized it stylistically in
                            the manner of Prout or Turner or Stothard.</p>
                        <p>In the fair copy, MS IX, each section except one, "Aix la Chapelle,"
                            consists of both verse and prose; and each section, up to "St. Goar," is
                            illustrated by at least one drawing. ("Aix la Chapelle" lacks a poem,
                            and it is ambiguous whether this section was meant to include one; see
                            item nos. 4-5 in the list below.) Many sections contain blank spaces
                            likely meant to be filled with additional drawings (i.e., the cut-out
                            slips with drawings, to be pasted into the space), which either Ruskin
                            either never completed, or which once were positioned in the manuscript
                            and afterward removed. Starting either with the section for "St. Goar"
                            or with that for "Heidelberg" (the Library Edition's documentation
                            confuses the issue, as explained below), even a single drawing is
                            presently lacking; and the fair copy of the text ends a short way into
                            the prose for "Heidelberg"--so at this point in MS IX, the fair-copy
                            project clearly had broken down, and it is unlikely that once-existing
                            drawings have been removed. These blank spaces in MS IX are as follows

                            unlike the "Watch-tower" sketch, has the appearance of a vignette made
                            for MS IX. If it ever was included in that manuscript, however,
                            Collingwood must have removed it prior to the editing of the Library

                            Ruskin had used since 1831--and would continue to use through 1836--for
                            rough copy of poetry and other imaginative work. The draft for the
                            "Account" in MS VIII first appears following draft for <ref

                            tribute for 1833--logically so, as the family departed for the tour
                            following John James's birthday. In this section of MS VIII, it is not
                            in all instances clear, however, what writing Ruskin intended for the
                            "Account," as he did not entitle the work as a whole, and left many of
                            its parts untitled, as well (see <ref type="apparatus"

                        <p>There is no indication how much time elapsed between composition of the
                            birthday ode in MS VIII, which must have preceded 10 May 1833, and the
                            ensuing entry of draft for the "Account"; Ruskin may not have resumed
                            use of MS VIII until following the family's return from the <ref

                            he took up this notebook to draft the "Account," he had already begun
                            the work in another manuscript or manuscripts. For example, two loose
                            sheets, which are now bound in MS
                            IA,<!-- CITE APPROPRIATE SECTIONS OF IA CONTENTS --> contain draft of
                            portions of the work that are not otherwise represented in the MS VIII
                            draft, and these versions of texts are unquestionably prior to those
                            texts' corresponding fair copies in MS IX, since revisions made to the
                            MS IA drafts are incorporated into the fair copies. Could these MS IA
                            sheets have been composed during the journey itself? There appears no
                            way of knowing for sure.</p>
                        <p>Nor does any extant manuscript evidence establish when Ruskin began
                            fair-copying vis-&#x00E0;-vis drafting. One broad inference on this
                            count does seem well enough justified, however, if not definitively
                            provable: namely, two MS IA draft
                            sheets<!-- CITE APPROPRIATE SECTIONS OF IA CONTENTS -->, which consist
                            solely of verse treatments of places belonging, topographically, to the
                            earliest stages of the tour (i.e., in northern France and Belgium),
                            preceded the MS VIII draft. The latter, in contrast, begins by
                            describing a very late stage of the tour (e.g., Chamouni), and proceeds
                            in no logical topographical order--in fact, turning backward in the
                            middle of the sequence to draft <hi rend="italic">prose</hi> accounts of
                                <hi rend="italic">earliest</hi> stages of the journey (e.g., for
                            Brussels, and for the Meuse). Clearly, then, Ruskin could not have begun
                            the MS VIII draft prior to the advanced stage of the tour with which it
                            begins ("The Source of the Arveron">; and he could not have started the
                            fair copy in MS IX prior to drafting its opening prose sections, which
                            appear well along in the MS VIII draft. The logical inference, then, is
                            that Ruskin started the draft in MS VIII after the family's return home
                            from the tour in late September 1833; and he started the fair copy, with
                            its elaborate drawings, even later in the fall or the winter of 1833-34.
                            That several of the drawings for earlier sections--those for "Cassel"
                            and "Lille," if not one for "Calais," as well--are based on lithographs
                            in Prout's <hi rend="italic">Facsimiles</hi> argues even more strongly
                            for Ruskin starting the fair copy at home, in late 1833, as the huge
                            Prout folio could not have been carried on the journey itself. </p>
                        <p>It may be hazarded, moreover, that the MS IA sheets containing solely
                            verse accounts of the northern France and Belgian stages of the tour
                            represent the earliest conception of the "Account"--whether or not the
                            sheets themselves (or a draft on which they are based) were composed
                            while the family was in progress on the tour. There survives also a
                            sheet--likewise later bound into MS IA, but quite different in
                            appearance from the other two sheets--which does contain both prose and
                            verse, but the selections pick out points along the entire tour,
                            beginning to end, as a kind of epitome of the whole. I hypothesize that
                            this sheet represents a transitional stage, a generic reconsideration of
                            the work, along the way to the composite form that emerges in MS VIII
                            and MS IX. In other words, a still broader inference from the draft
                            remains, and an arresting one, is that Ruskin arrived at the composite
                            genre of his work--verse, prose, and illustration--only gradually and
                            comparatively late in the compositional process, and that the initial
                            plan was for a solely verse account. Another This hypothesis radically
                            contradicts--indeed, inverts--Ruskin's narrative in <hi rend="italic"
                                >Praeterita</hi> of how Rogers's and Prout's ekphrastic works
                            brought about a kind of vocational conversion, prior to departure or
                            even proposing the journey of 1833.</p>

                            placing MS IX in column 1, as necessarily representing a teleological
                            intention, the table allows for an unfolding intentionality. The table
                            complements the following analysis of MS IA and MS VIII.</p>

                        <p>The manuscript portions of the "Account" bound into MS IA (a compilation
                            bound by Ruskin's editors, not by Ruskin himself) consists, first, of
                            two sheets<!-- link to appropriate Contents IA section --> of identical
                            size and containing text running continuously from one sheet to the
                            next. The first of these sheets is partly in the hand of John James
                            Ruskin, and partly in the hand of his son, while the second sheet is
                            entirely in John's hand. Together, these two sheets contain versions of
                            the first five poems of the "Account" as fair-copied in MS IX, and in
                            the order that those poems appear in the fair copy: "Calais," "Cassel,"
                            "Lille," "Brussels," and "The
                            Meuse."<!-- link respectively to IA transcripts --> While these versions
                            appear too neat to represent initial draft, they do contain
                            substitutions, and these changes are reflected in the fair copy, MS IX,
                            suggesting that the sheets may represent interim versions of these poems
                            between a lost earlier draft of these poems and their ultimate fair
                            copies in MS IX. Ruskin numbered the lines of the poems sequentially
                            (1-173)--that is, without starting his numbering anew with each
                            poem--confirming he had established their sequence (and their sequence
                            was established by topography, of course, as the traveler followed the
                            route from Calais to Brussels [see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual"

                        <p>A third sheet in MS IA, which differs physically from the other two
                            sheets, does present a prose section--a draft of the prose for "Calais,"
                            as fair-copied in MS IX. This is followed by draft of two poems that, in
                            topographical terms, skip far ahead in the tour to "Passing the Alps"
                            and "Milan Cathedral"; and then two more poems follow that, in
                            topographical terms, go backwards to the Rhine, "Andernacht" and "St.
                            Goar." The Alpine and Milan poems do not appear at all in the fair copy,
                            MS IX (this draft is the sole source of copytext for these poems in <hi
                                rend="italic">Poems</hi> 1891 and the Library Edition versions of
                            the "Account"). The Rhine poems do appear in MS IX fair copies, versions
                            that incorporate substitutions shown in this draft. (These are not the
                            versions of those two Rhine poems as they would be published in <hi
                                rend="italic">Friendship's Offering</hi> for 1835.) Since the
                            corresponding prose sections for "Andernacht" and "St. Goar" are drafted
                            near the beginning of the "Account" draft in MS VIII, it is reasonable
                            to conclude that this sheet represents a stage of composition between
                            the other two MS IA sheets containing the first five poems, and the
                            rather chaotic draft (in terms of topographical sequence) taken up in
                            the draft notebook, MS VIII. It may be also be hazarded, if more
                            cautiously, that this third sheet represents a transition in terms of
                            work's generic character--from a verse travelogue to a composite work.
                            Possibly carrying along with that development, MS VIII contains rough
                            pen-and-ink sketches.<!-- Give links to MS VIII apparatus --></p>
                        <p>An additional clue tending to confirm this proposed sequence of
                            composition is Ruskin's line numbering for verse draft, which appears
                            both in the MS IA sheets and in the portion of MS VIII devoted to
                            drafting the "Account." As mentioned, the five poems in the two MS IA
                            sheets in John's and John's James's hands are numbered continuously 1 to
                            173. In the third MS IA sheet, starting with "Passing the Alps," the
                            line numbering is again continuous from poem to poem, 360-429. The line
                            numbering in MS VIII begins with line 506. The line numbering carries
                            relentlessly forward along with the physical sequence of the drafts of
                            poems, without regard for their topographical logic (which is mixed),
                            but this fact would seem to reinforce the connection of the numbering
                            with the sequence of composition. (That is, the numbering bears no
                            relation to the ultimate rearrangement of these sections for the fair
                                copy.)<note>One cannot assume, it is true, that the sequence of
                                draft in MS VIII represents exactly the sequence of composition.
                                Take, as an example of possible inconsistency with appearances, the
                                prose section on Brussels, which begins on 62r, three-quarters down
                                the page. Ruskin entitled this segment "Part of Brussels," and
                                extended the draft halfway through 62v. Here, the draft stops in
                                mid-sentence (". . . circumnavigating," for <del>traversing</del>),
                                and is followed by a poem, "Oh softly blew the mounting breeze"
                                (entitled "Chiavenna" in the 1891 Poems and the Library Edition).
                                Ruskin numbered these lines 810-22, which is continuous with a
                                previous installment of verse (778-809, for a quite different poem,
                                "The Black Forest," as so-called in the later editions). The
                                remainder of the prose passage on Brussels ("perambulating . . .
                                tread on it softly") begins at the top of the next recto, 63r, and
                                finishes on 63v. One inference is that Ruskin wrapped the prose
                                around the poem, already drafted in its place, on 62v. Another
                                explanation, however, is that the sequence of composition was what
                                it appears to be, but the abrupt shifts between prose and poetry
                                provide a clue about the process of fair-copying. In the fair copy
                                of this prose passage on Brussels in MS IX, a line of text ends with
                                "circumnavigating for" (the "for" jammed against the justified right
                                margin). The next line of text takes up with
                                "perambulating.&#x2014;Oh woe to the weather" etc. One might infer,
                                then, that Ruskin fair-copied in MS IX as far as he had drafted in
                                MS VIII (62v); crossed out the last word in draft
                                    (<del>traversing</del>), which he could not fit on the line in
                                MS IX (hence, the run-together "circumnavigating,for"); stopped
                                fair-copying to draft the poem "Oh softly blew the mounting breeze,"
                                numbering its lines in correct sequence; and then resumed drafting
                                the prose passage, but changing his mind about the next word (making
                                it "perambulating," rather than "traversing"). Either scenario can
                                be supported by the evidence.</note></p>
                        <p>After the draft in MS VIII supplies the prose sections corresponding to
                            the MS IA "Andernacht" and "St. Goar," it goes on to mix poetry about
                            the Alpine and Italian segments of the tour with draft of prose
                            corresponding to earlier IA poems, such prose descriptions of "Brussels"
                            and "The Meuse." The appearance of such prose pieces may signal Ruskin's
                            simultaneously working on the opening sections of MS IX, but that work
                            may have been delayed until later.</p>
                        <p>In MS VIII, Ruskin's line numbering may lead to some ambiguities in what
                            belongs to the "Account" project. Following the May 1833 birthday ode
                            for Ruskin's father, the first piece to appear sequentially, and the
                            first in MS VIII to exhibit line numbering, is <ref type="apparatus"
                                target="oh_are_there_spirits_apparatus.html">"Oh are there spirits,
                                can there be"</ref>, which picks up the numbering system with line
                            506. As already suggested, many months may have elapsed between
                            composition of the May birthday ode and this poem--a period when Ruskin
                            was drafting the "Account" on loose sheets like those in MS IA. The
                            ambiguity here is that this poem, "Oh are there spirits, can there be,"
                            cannot be definitely associated with the "Account" (Ruskin did not
                            fair-copy the lyric in MS IX, but he left that version far from
                            complete). project. The poem is separated from the preceding verse for
                            the birthday ode by a horizontal line--a designation that, throughout MS
                            VIII, appears to divide one work from another--but Ruskin supplies no
                            title for this piece in particular or for the "Account" in general that
                            establishes the start of the project's draft in MS VIII. The line
                            numbering provides the only clue. If the lyric does belong to the
                            "Account," its reference to spiritual presences, rather than to visible
                            topography, would seem to have significant implications for how Ruskin
                            thought about his first journey abroad, particularly mountain
                            scenery.</p>
                        <p>Following this lyric, both the content of the drafts and other physical
                            indications in the manuscript (see <ref type="apparatus"
                                target="ms_viii_apparatus.html#DESCRIPTION">MS VIII:
                                Description</ref>) leave little doubt that, in this portion of the
                            notebook, Ruskin was exclusively occupied with the "Account." Only
                            toward the end of this portion, draft of sections for the "Account"
                            become mixed with drafts of the May 1834 birthday poems for John James,

                            question whether the line numbering system--which persists into the
                            birthday odes--can serve as a reliable identifier of earlier "Account"
                            draft (such as the enigmatic "Oh are there spirits, can there be"), the
                            run-up of the "Account" draft against the birthday poems does at least
                            provide evidence of dating. Ruskin was now drafting the "Account" in MS
                            VIII, and may have been simultaneously fair-copying in MS IX, into the
                            first quarter of 1834. Moreover, judging by the scarcity of other
                            (extant) work from winter 1833-34, compared to the outpouring of
                            1831-33, he was occupied with the "Account" almost exclusively. It may
                            be that Ruskin largely completed the fair copy of the Account in MS IX
                            through its Rhine journey sections during the winter of 1833 and early
                            1834, since, following the incompletely fair-copied prose section on
                            Heidelberg, which is the last section to be attempted in MS IX, there
                            occur only the drawings of mountain scenery, some of which may have been
                            inspired by illustrations in <ref type="bibliography"

If you wanted your <ref> for "Oh are there spirits, can there be" in msvii_apparatus.xml to point here, you would add the XML ID 1 (see msvii_apparatus.xml) to the <cell> (i.e. <cell role="data" xml:id="1">). Note that a # does NOT precede the XML ID. The symbol is reserved for the @corresp, used to refer back to a unique XML ID, which, in turn, defines some object (e.g. a person, a place). Here, the unique XML ID 1 serves as a navigation anchor; it does not "refer" to a defined object. Because XML IDs are unique, I have NOT added the ID below; if I had, I would have invalidated this document: encoding a unique XML ID twice: once above and then again below.-->

                                        lines 8 and 27 identify what the prose passage calls "our

                                business partner, Henry Telford--of the 1830 illustrated edition of
                                Rogers's <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>. "It is curiously tiresome
                                that Mr. Telford did not himself write my name in the book, and my

                                more curiously, for him, puts no date: if it was a year later [i.e.,

                                Rogers's poem had been in the Ruskin household since 1828 at the

                                also the year that, in disgust over the work's tepid reception, the
                                poet bought out remaining copies of both parts and destroyed them
                                (see <ref type="note" subtype="biographical"

                                (1763-1855)</ref>). Thus, even before the poem achieved popularity
                                in the illustrated edition, the Ruskins could count themselves among
                                the select number of appreciative readers of Rogers's <hi

                                gift of the illustrated version. There is even an outside
                                possibility that Ruskin did not study the illustrated edition until
                                after the family had returned from the Continent, as John James's
                                accounts record purchase of a copy of <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>
                                in October 1833, just shortly after the September homecoming (<ref

                                This could well have been an additional copy, but one cannot
                                discount the possibility that Rogers's tutelage of the Ruskins'
                                viewing of the Alps and Italy was, during the tour itself, solely
                                poetic, without the ekphrastic support of Turner and
                                Stothard.</note> the autobiography's story can be linked reliably to
                            the family's acquisition of Samuel Prout's <hi rend="italic">Facsimiles
                                of Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany</hi>. This work, which
                            appeared in Spring 1833 with John James Ruskin listed among the
                            subscribers, and which is listed in the senior Ruskin's accounts for
                            that year, is most directly credited in <hi rend="italic"
                                >Praeterita</hi> for prompting the family's first major tour of the
                            Continent: "there is no doubt . . . that early in the spring of 1833
                            Prout published his <hi rend="italic">Sketches in Flanders and
                                Germany</hi>. I well remember going with my father into the shop
                            where subscribers entered their names, and being referred to the
                            specimen print, the turreted window over Moselle, at Coblentz. We got
                            the book home to Herne Hill before the time of our usual annual tour."
                            More apocryphal may be the spontaneity of the outcome that Ruskin says
                            to have arisen from enjoyment of Prout's lithographs: "as my mother
                            watched my father's pleasure and mine in looking at the wonderful
                            places, she said, why should we not go and see some of them in reality?
                            My father hesitated a little, then with glittering eyes said--why not?
                            And there were two or three weeks of entirely rapturous and amazed
                            preparation" (<ref type="bibliography"

                        <p>Regardless of how the family's planning actually unfolded respecting the
                            acquisition of these two books, implicit in the story is the books'
                            representative role (whether exclusively so or not) in the family's
                            conceptualization of their northern and southern destinations. Prout's
                                <hi rend="italic">Facsimiles</hi> provided a pictorial tour through
                            Belgium and Germany, whereas Rogers led the reader on the more
                            traditional Grand Tour of the South. The books contrasted also in their
                            material representations. The <hi rend="italic">Facsimiles</hi>
                            consisted of 50 lithographic prints of picturesque architectural sites
                            in Belgium and Germany, with no letterpress--only the place names
                            lettered directly onto the lithographic stone, as part of images,
                            identifying the locales depicted. The lithographs, then a new medium in
                            Britain, would have struck the Ruskins with their dramatically large
                            size (22 by 15 inches) and watercolor-like texture, as compared with the
                            exquisite preciousness of Rogers's <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>,
                            illustrated with vignette engravings (2-3 inches by 3-4 inches). The <hi
                                rend="italic">Italy</hi> was also ekphrastic in the
                            late-eighteenth-century manner, with Rogers's topographical poem
                            assuming priority in topographical description, despite the poem's
                            having gained its popularity solely byt means of the graphic
                            enhancements.</p>
                        <p>Despite these material and substantive contrasts in framing the Ruskins'
                            tour, both books represented the bourgeoning publishing trade that
                            responded to the growth in British travel on the Continent in the
                            decades immediately after Waterloo; and both complemented improvements
                            in transport and tourism with their show of technical advances in
                            printing--lithography in Prout's case, steel engraving in Rogers's (for

                        <p>While Ruskin's later autobiographical account doubtless lays too much
                            weight on these two particular publications, Rogers's and Prout's books
                            can be usefully understaood as representative of changing modes of
                            travel and travel art and literature in the 1820s and 1830s. Critics and
                            biographers, following Ruskin's cue in limiting their view to just these
                            two books, have been lead to treat Ruskin's own literary and artistic
                            response, his "Account," as merely derivative--an imitation--of these
                            sources. For that matter, the "Account" is even more falsely treated as
                            an imitation solely of the 1830 illustrated <hi rend="italic"
                            >Italy</hi>, with Prout's influence passed
                            over.<!-- references needed for this view --> But the "Account" not only
                            responds creatively, and not just derivatively, to these two books, but
                            also reflects with considerable complexity the context of the decades
                            after Waterloo that made these books possible and successful.</p>
                        <p>As remarked in Composition and Publication, the compositional history of
                            the "Account" suggests competing or evolving generic intentions, from
                            the poetic travelogue in early MS IA draft to the composite work
                            developed in MS VIII and MS IX. These evolving manuscript states may
                            point to creative tensions that Ruskin discovered in his sources and
                            creatively exploited. The two MS IA sheets in John's and John James's
                            hands, being solely in verse form, reflect the influence of Rogers's
                            poetic travelogue (although <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> does contain
                            some prose); yet, Ruskin's (and his father's?) poems adapt the poetic
                            travelogue, which Rogers organizes around the traditional Grand Tour, to
                            the Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Belgium, the northern sites depicted by
                            Prout. The MS VIII draft and MS IX fair copy, in contrast, use both
                            verse and prose to represent the northern as well as southern segments
                            of the tour. Thus, the MS IA sheets represent a stage when the project
                            aspired to an exclusively "metrical journal"--the term used ultimately
                            and inaccurately to describe the project when excerpts were published in
                            1835 as "fragments of a metrical journal"--and reflect the influence of
                            Rogers and the tradition of the eighteenth-century topographical poem.
                            The later compositional stage, incorporating prose and illustration,
                            reaches beyond Rogers's neoclassicism to attempt a mixed genre
                            symptomatic of a transitional stage in English travel writing and
                            artistic representation that emerged in the 1820s and 1830s.</p>
                        <p>In these decades, this emergent touristic experience was most vivid in
                            routes through northern Europe rather than along the well-worn path of
                            the Grand Tour to Italy. Ruskin's memory in <hi rend="italic"
                                >Praeterita</hi> of the significance of Prout's <hi rend="italic"
                                >Facsimiles</hi> in prompting the family's journey is corroborated
                            by the novelty that the artist's representations of towns in northern
                            France, Belgium, and Germany afforded to British viewers in 1833. While
                            such scenic representations grew more familiar in the later 1830s and
                            1840s from similar projects by T. M. Richardson (1784-1848), J. D.
                            Harding (1797-1863), T. S. Boys (1803-74), Clarkson Stanfield
                            (1793-1867), and Louis Haghe (1806-85), Prout was a foundational
                            influence on artists seeking architectural picturesque subjects in this
                            region (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#LOCKETTPROUT"
                                >Lockett, <hi rend="italic">Samuel Prout</hi></ref>, 76).</p>
                        <p>Prout's role in this transition remains an emphasis even in Ruskin's
                            later writing about the artist. Despite Ruskin's changing purposes over
                            the years, his writing always refers back to Prout's discovery of
                            northern Europe as the artist's distinction in these earlier decades.
                            For example, in his 1849 article on Prout for the <hi rend="italic">Art
                                Journal</hi>, Ruskin characterizes Prout's first tour of the region
                            in terms of conversion and destiny, "the painter's vocation . . . fixed
                            from that hour. The first effect upon his mind was irrepressible
                            enthusiasm, with a strong feeling of a new-born attachment to Art, in a
                            new world [in northern Europe] of exceeding interest." While the essay
                            is in keeping with the concerns of <hi rend="italic">The Seven Lamps of
                                Architecture</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Stones of
                            Venice</hi>--situating Prout's personal discovery of vocation within a
                            larger history framed by a critique of misguided modernist feeling
                            (Prout "became the interpreter of a great period of the world's history,
                            of that in which age and neglect had cast the interest of ruin over the
                            noblest ecclesiastical structures of Europe, and in which there had been
                            born at their feet a generation . . . which understood not their
                            meaning" and which would destroy those structures, in Ruskin's view, by
                            way of "resoration" [<ref type="bibliography"
                                target="bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Works</hi></ref>, 12:311, 314])--the core of the argument is
                            built arount Prout's discovery of Flanders. Likewise, in his 1879-80 <hi
                                rend="italic">Notes</hi> on Prout prepared to accompany his loan of
                            drawings for exhibition at the Fine Art Society, Ruskin's experience of
                            Prout in the 1830s is preserved in his later purpose, which is to
                            hearken autobiographically to his youth spent with his father in regular
                            attendance at the Old Water Colour Society. There, Ruskin alleges,
                            Prout's discovery of northern Europe earned the artist "by common and
                            tacit consent" the "privilege . . . to introduce foreign elements of
                            romance and amazement into this--perhaps slightly fenny--atmosphere of
                            English common sense" typical of the homelier subjects of other artists
                                (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE"
                                >Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 14:390). This latter
                            characterization comes closest to <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi>'s

                        <p>In 1833, travel in the Pas-de-Calais and Flanders remained comparatively
                            unfamiliar to English tourists except as a route to be got over as
                            quickly as possible on the way to France and Germany. (Prout's even more
                            far-flung destinations in Eastern Europe, such as Prague, which he
                            depicted in the <hi rend="italic">Facsimiles</hi> and exhibited
                            watercolors, found little success with the public.) Since the early
                            1820s, Prout had established his lead in depicting the market towns of
                            this region for the Old Water Color Society. Accordingly, his <hi
                                rend="italic">Facsimiles</hi> of 1833 may well have served as a kind
                            of guide for the Ruskins to adopt a more leisurely and attentive pace
                            through these towns. In fact, the Ruskins traced a route through
                            northern France and Germany similar to that of the artist's sketching
                            tour of 1821, although the sequence of the published lithographs in <hi
                                rend="italic">Facsimiles</hi> departs somewhat from that route,

                            with initiating the modern genre of the English traveler's guidebook,
                            but earlier journeys like the Ruskins', taken between the reopening of
                            the Continent after Waterloo and the late 1830s, had to rely on a
                            transitional period of travel writing and illustration, of which Prout's
                                <hi rend="italic">Facsimiles</hi> formed a part. As Pieter
                            Fran&#x00E7;ois has shown, prior to the publication of Murray's <hi
                                rend="italic">Hand-book</hi>, there appeared between 1815 and the
                            1830s numerous examples of the guidebook genre in an emerging and
                            somewhat inchoate form, particularly as related to the Low Countries.
                            After Waterloo, the modern guidebook gradually emerged as a genre
                            distinct from the travel "account" in offering mainly practical travel
                            advice, as compared with the traditional travel account's emphasis on
                            topographical description and narrative from an individual (but not too
                            individualistic) perspective. In the transitional, post-Waterloo period,
                            however, genres became mixed: the emerging, modern guidebooks, along
                            with their practical advice, often retained traces of the
                            eighteenth-century travel account--for example, by presenting
                            recommendations in epistolary form--whereas, correspondingly, the more
                            traditional travel accounts of the period (which became legion when the
                            Continent reopened) recommended themselves in a crowded field by
                            proferring the detailed practical advice more typical of the guidebook

                        <p>In 1833-34, this transitional and eclectic period of travel writing is
                            reflected in the Ruskins' book purchases, both before setting out on
                            their journey and following their return. Prior to departure, besides
                            admiring Rogers's <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> and Prout's <hi

                            Fran&#x00E7;ois and James Buzard as characteristic of the transitional

                            similarly describes as moving away from the decorum of the

                            regions of Europe in an appendix, the main text remained traditionally
                            focused on getting the traveler first to Paris, and then to Italy. Yet,
                            once arrived in the South, the Ruskins would have found Starke's work
                            handy for its more modern, guidebook-like feature of convenient

                            composition of the "Account" in 1834, John James continued to acquire
                            travel publications typical of this eclectic, transitional period. There
                            were travel accounts written in the immediate post-Waterloo period by
                            Vicomte Fran&#x00E7;ois Ren&#x00E9; de Chateaubriand (1768-1848) and by
                            William Stewart Rose (1775-1843), an associate of Byron and

                            inventive genres of travel writing that were vying to serve the rising
                            tide of middle-class tourism on the Continent. Rogers's neoclassical
                            poetry seems out of step. Turner complied with Rogers's style, reining
                            in his apocalyptic manner in favor of nondramatic perspective and
                            essentializing representations of landscape and buildings (see <ref

                            drew on up-to-date printing methods, exploiting the popularity of the
                            literary "annuals," illustrated by steel engravings that allowed durable
                            mass production for mass production and wide distribution. Even within
                            this mode of production, the 1830 <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> was
                            innovative, in combining intaglio illustration with relief type on the

                            when Pringle ushered the prodigy to St. James Place, Rogers's palace of
                            neoclassical art, to meet the great man. The only known records of this
                            episode, Ruskin's stories about the meeting in much later
                            autobiographical writing, again retain a germ of an essential experience
                            of the 1830s--namely, that the boy "knew more of the vignettes [in <hi
                                rend="italic">Italy</hi>] than the verses" (<ref type="bibliography"
                                target="bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Works</hi></ref>, 34:96, and see also 35:93). Of course he did,
                            as he had been so obsessively studying and copying the engravings for
                            his own "Account," even imitating the fine, intaglio lines in his
                            drawings. The boy probably knew better than Rogers did how this modern
                            refinement of intaglio technique compared with the radically different
                            feel of the new lithography, since Ruskin had imitated both results for
                            his "Account." In fact, while the circumstances are not documented, it
                            is a reasonable guess that Pringle gained Ruskin's access to Rogers by
                            borrowing MS IX beforehand, to exhibit their precocious imitations of
                            the illustrated <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> to the boy's fellow
                            entrepreneur of modern, refined ekphrastic writing.</p>
                        <p>Let's say that the audience with Rogers took place in early 1834, when
                            Ruskin had pushed on with his fair copy of the "Account" in MS IX. By
                            that time, it must have been decided that he would contribute selections
                            from the "Account" to <ref type="bibliography"

                            annual as "fragments" from a "metrical journal," and printing them
                            without their prose or pictorial accompaniments, return the project
                            full-circle to its apparently purely verse beginnings in MS IA; and in
                            so doing, bring the project round to knowing more of the verses than the
                            vignettes, after all. This courteous nod to the eighteenth century would
                            have been arranged not only by Pringle but also, presumably, by his
                            friend, John James Ruskin, whose hand is manifest in the earliest, fully
                            poetic MS IA stage of the project. In this instance, a struggle of
                            intentions between an eighteeenth-century verse genre and a
                            nineteenth-century composite genre won out in the fathers' favor. In the
                            same volume of <hi rend="italic">Friendship's Offering</hi>, however,
                            Ruskin also contributed the poem, "Saltzburg," written to order as
                            accompaniment to a steel-engraved plate, meant to entertain the modern
                            middle-class consumer.</p>

                                however, Ruskin appears completely unconscious of recent political
                                history. Inevitably, as an English travel narrative, the "Account"
                                does comment on national identities, seeing Calais as "an
                                introduction to France, and to the French," but the narrator
                                moralizes in non-specific terms. On the road between Calais and
                                Brussels, climbing to the top of Mont Cassel, the narrator points
                                out the "fifteen battle-fields" visible from the eminence that tell
                                "a fearful tale of the ready ire of nations, yet looking as green
                                and peaceful as if they had never been watered with blood." Nothing
                                is said about such signs of recent conflict as the destruction of
                                the ancient Abbey of St. Bertin at St. Omer; rather, while the
                                narrator, passing St. Omer, sneers at the "serpent folds" of "Romes
                                religion" hidden beneath a religious procession, the English
                                anti-Catholic sentiment associated with that place was as old as the
                                Gunpowder Plot--the Jesuit College at St. Omer having been
                                implicated in that history.</p>
                            <p>Similarly out of date is the poem's passage through France to Belgium
                                and the neglect of any commentary on the Belgian character. The
                                Belgian Revolution of 1830 had established the Kingdom of Belgium as
                                a state separate from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. English
                                attitudes to the new kingdom--as Pieter Fran&#x00E7;ois finds,
                                examining such popular sources as travel guidebooks--were initially
                                divided along party lines, with Whigs approving the Catholic
                                revolutionaries and Tories supporting the Protestant Dutch kingdom
                                (Murray's 1836 <hi rend="italic">Hand-book</hi> remained staunchly
                                Tory). Over the course of the 1830s, however, British opinion
                                unified around a myth of Belgium as a "little Britain" that had
                                copied its neighbor's constitutionalism and rising
                                industrialization, shared a royal connection in King Leopold I, and
                                even harbored an alleged "hidden" protestantism beneath the nation's
                                apparent Catholic national identity (<ref type="bibliography"

                                drawing in MS IX, until his attention was captured by imitating
                                Brockendon in late February 1834--appears corroborated by comparing
                                the sequence of sections in the fair copy against the progress of
                                draft in MS VIII. To facilitate the following comparisons of fair
                                copy with rough draft, Table 1 arranges the sections of the Account
                                in columns according to manuscript. Column ?, listing MS IX, the
                                illustrated fair copy, should be read as the base column, for only
                                here are the sections listed in the order they appear in manuscript.
                                Other manuscript copies of sections (in IA, VII, VIII, and XI) are
                                matched against the base column in order to establish the
                                relationship between drafting and fair-copying. Thus, the columns
                                for MSS IA, VII, VIII, and XI do not show the sequential order of
                                sections in those manuscripts, but the sequences can be inferred
                                from column ?, which lists Ruskin’s continuous line numbering.
                                Ruskin’s line numbering, which he used in MSS IA and VIII, is
                                carried sequentially throughout the poems; i.e., he did not start
                                his numbering anew with each poem but numbered continuously from
                                poem to poem, skipping over the prose draft. Presumably the system
                                served Ruskin as a guide to fair-copying. In the fair copy, MS IX,
                                he left some pages blank for prose or poetry to be added later but
                                pasted in illustrations, and he filled other pages with writing but
                                left blank spaces for illustrations. To work in this piecemeal
                                manner, he must have known the length of the sections to be
                                copied--hence, his line numbering. It is tempting to declare that
                                the numbering also establishes the sequence of composition; however,
                                the numbering could have been added at any time after the poems’
                                drafting. ; however, the order of sections in these manuscripts is
                                more conveniently listed in Part 1. For other directions to
                                interpreting Table 1, see the notes at the bottom of the table.) The
                                chronology of composition is equally conjectural, since Ruskin left
                                no dates on draft or fair copy. The first five poems of the
                                travelogue (“Calais,” “Cassel,” “Lille,” “Brussels,” and “The
                                Meuse”), without their respective prose sections, appear on two
                                sheets in MS IA in the order they are fair-copied in the illustrated
                                version, MS IX (see part 1, MS IA, “Content,” g). These sheets are
                                mostly in Ruskin’s hand but partly in John James’s. What stage of
                                draft they represent cannot be determined, except that they probably
                                predate the fair-copy MS IX, since they share a characteristic of
                                the MS VIII draft--namely, Ruskin’s line numbering, The line
                                numbering on the two MS IA sheets containing the first five poems
                                begins at one and carries through 173 for the first four poems; the
                                fifth poem, “The Meuse,” is unnumbered, because it is crowded
                                sideways on the second sheet, with no space left for numbering. One
                                might infer from these two sheets in MS IA containing the initial
                                poems of the Account that Ruskin composed substantial portions of
                                the verse prior to the prose. Such a conclusion cannot be warranted,
                                however, in absence of the purpose of these sheets. The pieces
                                fair-copied in MS VII cannot be dated, except as probably postdating
                                the last use of that notebook for the fair copy of “Athens.” Since
                                the draft of that epic was abandoned in 1832, prior to the Account
                                project, this lower limiting date is of no use. Only the MS VIII
                                pieces are unquestionably rough drafts and probably more or less
                                sequential, therefore providing clues to the order of composition,
                                if not precise dates. Also, on the back endpapers of MS VIII, Ruskin
                                entered a list of proposed sections of the poem (reproduced in WS,
                                pl. 6b). Table 1 shows that the first draft sections in MS VIII to
                                be fair-copied in MS IX were the prose sections on Andernacht and
                                St. Goar. At this stage MS IX falters to a halt, with spaces for
                                drawings left blank, and the fair copy following St. Goar--on
                                Heidelberg--left incomplete. Since the fter St. Goar, the Meuse,
                                Cologne, and Brussels--respectively, the fourth, fifth, eleventh,
                                twelfth, fifteenth and seventeenth Account-related entries in MS
                                VIII. This may suggest, though with no certainty, that by the time
                                Ruskin was about halfway into the MS VIII draft (i.e., the fifteenth
                                and seventeenth of thirty-seven items in MS VIII), he had already
                                begun fair-copying and illustrating MS IX, i.e., the poetry and
                                prose sections of “Calais,” “Cassel,” “Lille,” “Brussels,” “Meuse,”
                                “Aix-la-Chapelle,” “Cologne,” “Andernacht,” “Ehrenbreitstein,” “St.
                                Goar,” and “Heidelberg.” (Note that MS IX’s relatively late prose
                                sections for “Andernacht” and “St. Goar” occur quite early in MS
                                VIII, the fourth and fifth entries, while “Aix-la-Chapelle” and
                                “Ehrenbreitstein” and “Heidelberg” occur later among the MS VIII
                                entries, scattered between the twenty-first and thirty-third.) Since
                                the verse portions of the five opening sections of MS IX exist in MS
                                IA copy, one might hazard that Ruskin began by drafting,
                                fair-copying, and illustrating the Account as a response to Samuel
                                Prout’s Sketches in Flanders and Germany. MS VIII, despite its
                                drafts related to the German stages of the journey, appears more
                                closely modeled on Samuel Rogers’s Italy. Putting aside the prose
                                sections on Andernacht and St. Goar, MS VIII begins with a cluster
                                of mountain pieces--the Arveron and Arve pieces, the sighting of the
                                Alps from Schaffhausen, the crossing of the Alps into Italy--and
                                then roughly alternates Italian and Swiss with German descriptions.
                                In the absence of benchmark dates except at the point when Ruskin
                                paused amid the “Tour” in MS VIII to compose his father’s birthday
                                poems for 1834 (see app. A, MS VIII, “Content,” [b]), various
                                scenarios are possible. Unquestionably, the fair-copying in MS IX
                                was begun at home, following the journey, since sections as early as
                                “Lille” comment on Italian stages of the itenerary (although the
                                tipped-in drawings conceivably could have been started during the
                                journey). This fair-copying may have started from draft, now lost
                                though possibly represented by sheets in MS IA, that could have been
                                composed during the journey itself, or soon following it. If so, the
                                draft in MS VIII shows Ruskin composing for the on-going
                                fair-copying of Lowland and German sections and, simultaneously, for
                                the later largely Swiss and Italian sections that were never
                                fair-copied. (Ruskin did, however, place illustrations, with no
                                text, in MS IX that depict mountain and lake scenes for the later
                                sections; see Works 2:364 n. 1. For these sketches, he also put to
                                use an older rough-draft notebook, MS VI; see app. A, “Content”
                                [e].) The illustration of the Swiss passages could have been
                                spurred, not only by Rogers’s Italy, but also by William
                                Brockendon’s Illustrations of the Passes of the Alps and H. B.
                                Saussure’s Voyages dans les Alpes, both of which Ruskin received for
                                his birthday in February 1834 (RFL 278). Alternatively, MS VIII
                                could represent Ruskin’s initial poetic response to the
                                Continent--the sublimities of the Alps and the Italian lakes,
                                mediated by Scott, Rogers, and Byron, taking precedence over the
                                Proutian picturesque. (Even the early occurring “Andernacht” and
                                “St. Goar” prose sections concern the psychology of mountain and
                                hill viewing.)</p>
