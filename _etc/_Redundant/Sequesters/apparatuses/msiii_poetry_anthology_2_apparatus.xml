                <head>MS III Second Poetry Anthology</head>
                <p> Ruskin compiled this anthology in MS III in 1828, sometime after New
                    Year&#x02BC;s Day, making it the second anthology in this Red Book, after
                    Poetry Descriptive (1827) (see MS III: Discussion; see also MS III Third Poetry
                    Anthology). Ruskin entitled the collection &#x201C;<hi rend="caps"
                        >Poetry</hi>,&#x201D; just as he had headed the MS I Poetry Anthology
                    as &#x201C;Poetry.&#x201D; The anthology contains the following poems,
                    in order of their appearance: </p>
                <p>

                        <item>&#x201C;The Constellations: Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and
                            Some of the Southern&#x201D;;</item>
                        <item>&#x201C;Time: Blank Verse&#x201D;;</item>
                        <item>&#x201C;The Sun&#x201D;;</item>
                        <item>&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Papa how
                            pretty those icicles are&#x201D;);</item>
                        <item>&#x201C;The Ship&#x201D; [1827];</item>
                        <item>&#x201C;The British Battles.&#x201D;</item>
                    </list>
                </p>
                <p>A drawing, Ship and House, [Miscellaneous Drawing, MS III], falls within the
                    anthology, and probably predates it. Ruskin probably intended the drawing to
                    illustrate &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 2, but, ending the
                    narrative earlier than expected, wrapped the drawing round by &#x201C;Time:
                    Blank Verse.&#x201D; Another drawing, &#x201C;Ragland Castle When
                    Newly Built,&#x201D; [Miscellaneous Drawing, MS III], forms the terminus of
                    the anthology and, again, probably predates it, but this drawing can be dated
                    less securely (see MS III: Discussion; MS III Drawings).</p>
                <p>See Poetry Descriptive for W. G. Collingwood&#x02BC;s assumption that this
                    collection along with the second form a single anthology. Of the second
                    anthology, however, only &#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D;
                    (&#x201C;Papa how pretty those icicles are&#x201D;) is
                    &#x201C;descriptive&#x201D; in the topographical sense of the earlier
                    collection, the second being dominated more by catalog poetry and New
                    Year&#x02BC;s poetry.</p>
