                    <l>Thou sun thou golden sun in beauty rise
                        And show thy yellow face among the clouds
                        Disperse the stars and make bright morning come
                        Break through the clouds and let thy golden beams
                        Shine on the earth. The birds arising sing
                        To hail the approach of thee. At the hot noon
                        Oft have I worked to make my garden nice
                        Till when I stopped the drops of perspiration
                        Fell from my brows. In the sweet afternoon
                        The air is balmy in that pleasant time
                        Oft have I walked with dear mamma beside me
                        To watch the flowers growing and to play
                        Upon the green. Then comes the evening dark
                        In which all nature quiet still remains
                        When seven of these are past a week is gone
                        And four of these a month doth constitute
                        And twelve of these the long long year doth make
                        But yet not all the year doth pass without
                        Some festivals and some of these iâ€™ll name
                        First solemn easter comes then whitsunday
                        Then christmas newyears day
                        And newyears day it is therefore papa
                        I must wish you a happy newyears day
                        And now a little description of the sun
                        The sun when first he rises is so bright
                        That nobody on him can look for if they did
                        Struck by his brightness blind they would be made
                        In the hot noon invisible he is
                        Save by the brightness round him to the eye
                        In Afternoon golden and silvery is he
                        And in dark evening he is not to be seen
                        Though his attendants are the moon comes first
                        Then evening star orion and the plough
                        Then great bear lesser and the northern crown
                        And having named these I end this poem
