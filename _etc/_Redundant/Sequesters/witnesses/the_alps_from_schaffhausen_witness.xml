                <l>Sabbath eve is sinking low </l>
                <l>O&#x02BC;er the blue <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine&#x02BC;s</geogName> sullen flow. </l>
                <l>He has worn a prisoned way </l>
                <l>&#x02BC;Neath the round hills&#x02BC; bending sway. </l>
                <l>Far and near their sides you see </l>
                <l>Gay with vivid greenery. </l>
                <l>Many a branch and bough is bending </l>
                <l>O&#x02BC;er the grey rocks, grim impending. </l>
                <l>Danced the leaves on the bent twigs high, </l>
                <l>Skeleton like on the evening sky. </l>
                <l>And the oaks threw wide their jagged spray </l>
                <l>On their old, straight branches mossed and grey, </l>
                <l>And the foam drove down on the water&#x02BC;s hue </l>
                <l>Like a wreath of snow on the sapphire&#x02BC;s blue. </l>
                <l>And a wreath of mist curled faint and far, </l>
                <l>Where the cataract drove his dreadful war. </l>

                <l>Their fixed solidity of size </l>
                <l>Told that they were not of the skies. </l>

                <l>Was not the wondrous battlement </l>
