                <p>&#x201C;It was drawing towards sunset when we got up to some sort of garden 
                promenade&#x2014;west of the town, I believe ; and high above the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>, so as 
                to command the open country across it to the south and west. At which 
                open country of low undulation, far into blue,&#x2014;gazing as at one of our 
                own distances from Malvern of <placeName corresp="#WORCESTERSHIRE">Worcestershire</placeName>, or Dorking of <placeName corresp="#KENT">Kent</placeName>,&#x2014;sud&#x2010; 
                denly&#x2014;behold&#x2014;beyond !

                <p>
                &#x201C;There was no thought in any of us for a moment of their being clouds. 
                They were clear as crystal, sharp on the pure horizon sky, and already 
                tinged with rose by the sinking sun. Infinitely beyond all that we had 
                ever thought or dreamed,&#x2014;the seen walls of lost Eden could not have 
                been more beautiful to us ; not more awful, round heaven, the walls of 
                sacred Death.&#x201D; (Praierita, I. vi.)

                    <l>On their old, straight branches mossed and grey,</l> 
                    <l>And the foam drove down on the water&#x02BC;s hue</l>
                    <l>Like a wreath of snow on the sapphire&#x02BC;s blue.</l> 
                    <l>And a wreath of mist curled faint and far,</l> 
                    <l>Where the cataract drove his dreadful war.</l>
