                    <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> did not rely on writing and editing as his primary income. In his <span class="title-essay-HARRISONREMINISCENCES">&#x201C;Notes and Reminiscences&#x201D;</span>, 
                    he mentions holding positions in connection with banking houses; and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>,

                    34:99). He refers apparently to the Crown Life Assurance Company, which existed from at least the early 1830s at 
                    New Bridge Street, <span class="placeName-BLACKFRIARS">Blackfriars</span>. (In <span class="date-1856-1858">1856&#x2013;58</span>,

                    As their home residence, the Harrisons lived nearby the Ruskins in the suburb of <span class="placeName-CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</span>, 
                    but <span class="persName-THILTON">Hilton</span> believes that, though <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> often dined at <span class="placeName-building-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> and later <span class="placeName-">Denmark Hill</span>, &#x201C;the Ruskins did not call at his small, poor home&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#HILTONRUSKINLATERYEARS");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-book-HILTONRUSKINLATERYEARS"><i>John Ruskin: The Later Years</i></span></a>, 217). <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> typically addressed <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> at his Crown Life office to discuss editorial business.
      </div>
      
      <div class="p">When the Ruskins first became acquainted with <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> (presumably when he took over editorship of 
                    <span class="title-anthology-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>), he would have been able to regale them 
                    with reports of conversation with such relics of Regency literary society as <span class="persName-WTB">William Beckford</span> (ca. <span class="date-1760-1844">1760&#x2013;1844</span>) 
                    as well as with influential literary men of the day, such as the editor <span class="persName-WJ">William Jerdan</span> (ca. <span class="date-1782-1869">1782&#x2013;1869</span>) 
                    and the author and clergyman <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/croly_george_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-GCREV">George Croly</span> (ca. <span class="date-1780-1860">1780&#x2013;1860</span>)</a>. 
                    <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>&#x02BC;s piquant recollections of famous writers&#x02BC; appearance, haunts, and conversation suggest a man of humor and observation, 
                    and a frequenter of convivial and benevolent institutions such as the Literary Fund Club. <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>, then, was a respectable 
                    City man with minor literary and artistic connections, who for that reason would have appealed to <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, 
                    and who shared <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s ultra&#x2010;Tory opinions about the supremacy of the British church and state as a bulwark against Roman Catholicism. 
                    <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> was also, one suspects, obsequious to the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskins</span>&#x02BC; pretensions and did not object to taking a gentlemanly form of remuneration for his services.
      </div>
      
      <div class="p">According to his reminiscences, <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> traced his first encounter with a famous
                    author to hearing <span class="persName-STC">S. T. Coleridge</span> (ca.<span class="date-1772-1834">1772&#x2013;1834</span>), in lectures that can
                    be dated , when <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> would have been  years old.
                    &#x201C;He was giving a series of lectures on the <span class="title-periodical-LITERARYGAZETTEBELLESLETTRES">Belles

                    <span class="placeName-FLEETST">Fleet Street</span>. . . . I heard <span class="persName-STC">Coleridge</span> lecture the same winter at the Surrey
                        Institution, formerly the Leverean Museum, on the <span class="placeName-SURREY">Surrey</span> side of <span class="placeName-BLACKFRIARSBRIDGE">Blackfriars

                    <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> was also personally acquainted with artists, even prior to
                    his association with the Ruskins. His association with <span class="persName-WE">William Etty</span>
                    (ca. <span class="date-1787-1849">1787&#x2013;1849</span>) reached back to ,

      </div>
      
      <div class="p"> <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> knew <span class="persName-DRP">Roberts</span> from their common association with
                    <span class="title-book-JENNINGSLANDSCAPE"><i>Jennings Landscape Annual</i></span>, but they did not collaborate on
                    <span class="persName-DRP">Roberts</span>&#x02BC;s important work for that publication based on his Spanish
                    excursion of <span class="date-1832-1833">1832&#x2013;33</span>. The letterpress for those volumes of

                    Instead, for the volume of <span class="date-1839">1839</span>, <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> collaborated with the artist <span class="persName-JHP">James
                    Holland</span> (ca. <span class="date-1799-1870">1799&#x2013;1870</span>) on depictions of <span class="placeName-PORTUGAL">Portugal</span>, the logical
                    follow&#x2010;up on the successful Spanish volumes (see
                    Saglia, &#x201C;Imag(in)ing Iberia&#x201D;). Surely it is no accident
                    that <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>&#x02BC;s writing about <span class="placeName-PORTUGAL">Portugal</span> for this important landscape
                    annual fell so close in time to his first introduction to his <span class="placeName-CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</span>

      </div>
      
      <div class="p">Subsequently, <span class="placeName-PORTUGAL">Portugal</span> became something of a specialty of <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>&#x02BC;s,

                    a &#x201C;specialty&#x201D; necessarily reflected a cultural
                    phenomenon&#x2014;in this case, the appeal of the <span class="placeName-IBERIA">Iberian peninsula</span> to the
                    late Romantic and early Victorian imagination, owing to <span class="placeName-SPAIN">Spain</span>&#x02BC;s
                    occupation and looting by <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span> and subsequent liberation, along with

                    fashion of many writers for the ephemeral travel literature of the day, culling
                    and synthesizing information available in the vast outpouring of volumes
                    published by travelers to exotic places. This approach is significant as it
                    provides some basis for speculating about the manner of conversation between
                    <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> and <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, who did possibly travel to <span class="placeName-PORTUGAL">Portugal</span> prior to his
                    marriage , and who was a partner with the Portuguese vintner <span class="persName-PD">Pedro Domecq</span> .

      <div class="p">The reticence of <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>, &#x201C;Notes and Reminiscences,&#x201D; in
                    which he mentions the Ruskins only in passing, perhaps played a part in
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s crafting of the much more delicately balanced
                    rhetoric&#x2014;poised between nostalgic admiration and critical
                    satire&#x2014;of his introduction to these sketches, &#x201C;My First

                    34:93&#x2013;104). For his part, <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> appears to have
                    deemed reflection on his friendship and professional relation with the Ruskins
                    as out of bounds for his &#x201C;Reminiscences&#x201D;, with the
                    possible exception of the section on <span class="placeName-OXFORD">Oxford</span>. That recollection reads like an
                    unused travel sketch for the annuals, recounted by the narrator of his other
                    tales and sketches&#x2014;genial, ironic, given to rhetorical flourish. The
                    sketch concludes by opening a window only slightly on the relationship he
                    developed with the &#x201C;Graduate of Oxford&#x201D;: &#x201C;As
                    in athletics, so in intellectual contests, life is often the price of the prize.
                    Here is a poem from the pen of an undergraduate, who has since achieved a
                    world&#x2010;wide fame. It was published without the name of the author, and I
                    dare not add it&#x201D;&#x2014;and he quotes &#x201C;Christ
