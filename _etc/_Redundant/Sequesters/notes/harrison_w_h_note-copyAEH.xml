                    writing and editing as his primary income: in his reminiscences, he mentions
                    holding positions in connection with banking houses, and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> seats him at a
                    &#x201C;desk in the Crown Life Office&#x201D; (<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <hi rend="italic"> <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title> </hi>,
                    34:99), referring apparently to the Crown Life Assurance Company,
                    which existed from at least the early <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830</date> at New Bridge
                    Street, <placeName corresp="#BLACKFRIARS">Blackfriars</placeName>. (In <date notBefore="1856" notAfter="1858">1856&#x2013;58</date>, the building was handsomely
                    remodeled in Venetian Gothic by <persName corresp="#TND">Deane</persName> and <persName corresp="#BW">Woodward</persName> [O&#x02BC;Dwyer,

                    Like the Ruskin family in the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1849">1830s&#x2013;40</date>s, the Harrisons resided in
                    the suburb of <placeName corresp="#CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</placeName>.</p>
                <p>When the Ruskins first became acquainted with <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> in 18<!--Entry needed here.-->, he would have
                    been able to regale them with reports of conversation with such relics of
                    Regency literary society as <persName corresp="#WTB">William Beckford</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1760" notAfter="1844">1760&#x2013;1844</date>) as well as
                    with minor, but influential literary men of the day, such as the editor <persName corresp="#WJ">William
                    Jerdan</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1782" notAfter="1869">1782&#x2013;1869</date>) and the author and clergyman <persName corresp="#GCREV">George Croly</persName>
                    (ca. <date notBefore="1780" notAfter="1860">1780&#x2013;1860</date>). <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>&#x02BC;s piquant recollections of famous
                    writers&#x02BC; appearance, haunts, and conversation suggest a man of humor
                    and observation, and a frequenter of convivial and benevolent institutions such
                    as the Literary Fund Club. <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>, then, was a respectable City man with
                    literary and artistic connections, who would have appealed to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>,
                    and who importantly could introduce the Ruskins to the fringes of the early
                    Victorian literary world.</p>
                <p>According to his reminiscences, <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> traced his first encounter with a famous
                    author to hearing <persName corresp="#STC">S. T. Coleridge</persName> (ca.<date notBefore="1772" notAfter="1834">1772&#x2013;1834</date>), in lectures that can
                    be dated <!--Entry needed here.-->, when <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> would have been <!--Entry needed here.--> years old.
                    &#x201C;He was giving a series of lectures on the Belles
                    Lettres in a large room on the first floor of a sixth&#2010;rate tavern at
                    the end of a blind alley on the right hand side of <placeName corresp="#FETTERLANE"></placeName>Fetter Lane, not far from
                    <placeName corresp="#FLEETST">Fleet Street</placeName>. . . . I heard <persName corresp="#STC">Coleridge</persName> lecture the same winter at the <orgName corresp="#SURREYINSTITUTION">Surrey
                    Institution</orgName>, formerly the <orgName corresp="#LEVEREANMUSEUM">Leverean Museum</orgName>, on the Surrey side of <placeName corresp="#BLACKFRIARSBRIDGE">Blackfriars

                    Reminiscences&#x201D; [<date when="1878-05">May 1878</date>] 537, 538). These lectures <!--Entry needed here.-->.
                    <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> was also personally acquainted with artists, even prior to
                    his association with the Ruskins. His association with <persName corresp="#WE">William Etty</persName>
                    (ca. <date notBefore="1787" notAfter="1849">1787&#x2013;1849</date>) reached back to <!--Entry needed here.-->,
                    &#x201C;When I first knew <persName corresp="#WE">Etty</persName> he was a pupil of <persName corresp="#STL">Sir Thomas
                    Lawrence</persName>&#x201D; (<persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>, &#x201C;Notes and
                    Reminiscences&#x201D; [<date when="1878-05">May 1878</date>] 538). This was <!--Entry needed here.-->. Where are the

                    50 letters, 1857&#x2013;63 <!--Correction needed here?--> and he mentions inviting <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> as
                    &#x201C;a very young man&#x201D; to dine at his house with artists
                    such as <persName corresp="#DRP">David Roberts</persName> (<date notBefore="1796" notAfter="1864">1796&#x2013;1864</date>) (<persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>, &#x201C;Notes and

                    701&#x2013;2).</p>
                <p> <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> knew <persName corresp="#DRP">Roberts</persName> from their common association with
                    <hi rend="italic"> <title type="book" corresp="#JENNINGSLANDSCAPE">Jennings Landscape Annual</title> </hi>, but they did not collaborate on
                    <persName corresp="#DRP">Roberts</persName>&#x02BC;s important work for that publication based on his Spanish
                    excursion of <date notBefore="1832" notAfter="1833">1832&#x2013;33</date>. The letterpress for those volumes of
                    <!--Entry needed here.-->&#x2013;<!--Entry needed here.--> was written by <persName corresp="#TRT">Thomas Roscoe</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1791" notAfter="1871">1791&#x2013;1871</date>).
                    Instead, for the volume of <date when="1839">1839</date>, <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> collaborated with the artist <persName corresp="#JHP">James
                    Holland</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1799" notAfter="1870">1799&#x2013;1870</date>) on depictions of <placeName corresp="#PORTUGAL">Portugal</placeName>, the logical
                    follow&#2010;up on the successful Spanish volumes (see
                    Saglia, &#x201C;Imag(in)ing Iberia&#x201D;). Surely it is no accident
                    that <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>&#x02BC;s writing about <placeName corresp="#PORTUGAL">Portugal</placeName> for this important landscape
                    annual fell so close in time to his first introduction to his <placeName corresp="#CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</placeName>
                    neighbors, the partner in a firm importing sherry from the vineyards of <persName corresp="#PD">Pedro
                    Domecq</persName> <!--Entry needed here.-->.</p>
                <p>Subsequently, <placeName corresp="#PORTUGAL">Portugal</placeName> became something of a specialty of <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>&#x02BC;s,
                    supplying the setting for other tales and poems in the annuals, such as <!--Entry needed here.-->.
                    <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> is self&#2010;consciously a writer of &#x201C;light
                    literature,&#x201D; however, and, for him,
                    a &#x201C;specialty&#x201D; necessarily reflected a cultural
                    phenomenon&#x2014;in this case, the appeal of the <placeName corresp="#IBERIA">Iberian peninsula</placeName> to the
                    late Romantic and early Victorian imagination, owing to <placeName corresp="#SPAIN">Spain</placeName>&#x02BC;s
                    occupation and looting by <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName> and subsequent liberation, along with
                    subsequent visits by <persName corresp="#DRP">Roberts</persName> and <persName corresp="#DWC">David Wilkie</persName> <!--Entry needed here.--> figuring in prominence of <!--Entry needed here.-->.
                    It is not known that <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> ever visited this country&#x2014; <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>
                    intimates that his old friend had never left <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName> (<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>,
                    <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title> <!--Entry needed here.-->)&#x2014;and it seems likely that <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> worked in the
                    fashion of many writers for the ephemeral travel literature of the day, culling
                    and synthesizing information available in the vast outpouring of volumes
                    published by travelers to exotic places. This approach is significant as it
                    provides some basis for speculating about the manner of conversation between
                    <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> and <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, who did possibly travel to <placeName corresp="#PORTUGAL">Portugal</placeName> prior to his
                    marriage <!--Entry needed here.-->, and who was a partner with the Portuguese vintner <persName corresp="#PD">Pedro Domecq</persName> <!--Entry needed here.-->.</p>
                <p>The reticence of <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>, &#x201C;Notes and Reminiscences,&#x201D; in
                    which he mentions the Ruskins only in passing, perhaps played a part in
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s crafting of the much more delicately balanced
                    rhetoric&#x2014;poised between nostalgic admiration and critical
                    satire&#x2014;of his introduction to these sketches, &#x201C;My First
                    Editor: An Autobiographical Reminiscence&#x201D; (<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <hi rend="italic"> <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title> </hi>,
                    34:93&#x2013;104). For his part, <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> appears to have
                    deemed reflection on his friendship and professional relation with the Ruskins
                    as out of bounds for his &#x201C;Reminiscences,&#x201D; with the
                    possible exception of the section on <placeName corresp="#OXFORD">Oxford</placeName>. That recollection reads like an
                    unused travel sketch for the annuals, recounted by the narrator of his other
                    tales and sketches&#x2014;genial, ironic, given to rhetorical flourish. The
                    sketch concludes by opening a window only slightly on the relationship he
                    developed with the &#x201C;Graduate of Oxford&#x201D;: &#x201C;As
                    in athletics, so in intellectual contests, life is often the price of the prize.
                    Here is a poem from the pen of an undergraduate, who has since achieved a
                    world&#2010;wide fame. It was published without the name of the author, and I
                    dare not add it&#x201D;&#x2014;and he quotes &#x201C;Christ
                    Church, <placeName corresp="#OXFORD">Oxford</placeName>&#x201D; ([<date when="1878-08">August 1878</date>] p. 223). The mixture of anxiety and
                    nostalgia speaks worlds without giving much away.</p>
                <p> <!--Entry needed here.-->. In later years, <persName corresp="#WHH">WHH</persName> approved of <persName corresp="#JR">JR</persName>&#x02BC;s denunciations of
                    liberalism: tone in which you have lately been dealing with grave subjects has
                    given me more pleasure than I can express. You have thrown the Bible at the
                    heads of public &#x0026; private sinners with a surer aim, and a greater force
                    than half the theologians of the day are displaying And you
                    don&#x02BC;t&#x2014;like some of them&#x2014;deal
                    in&#x201C;<hi rend="underline">nonnatural</hi> senses&#x201D;
                    which is the greatest <hi rend="underline">bosh</hi> in the world. No sentence
                    should have <hi rend="underline">two meanings</hi>. <persName corresp="#ALT">Tennyson</persName>&#x02BC;s have
