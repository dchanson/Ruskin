                <head type="title">Sotheby's Sale of Ruskin Manuscripts and Library, 1931</head>
                <p>On 18 May 1931, Sotheby &#x0026; Co. held a second sale of Ruskin's literary remains,
                    ten months following on the first, the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.html">Sotheby's Sale of Ruskin Manuscripts and Library, 1930</ref>.
                    As described in the title of the catalogue, the sale represented
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><hi rend="italic">The Final Portion of the Manuscripts &#x0026; Library of John Ruskin,
                        Removed from His Residence, Brantwood, Coniston, Which Is about To Be Offered for Sale, and the Property of the Late Joseph Arthur Palliser Severn, Esq.,
                        Removed from 9, Warwick Square, S.W.; and . . . a Small Library, Principally of Modern Authors and of Finely Printed and Illustrated Books, the Property of Mrs. Mander,
                    Blacketts, Chorley Wood, Herts.</hi></ref>.
                    The 1930 sale had been the more consequential event, and neither of the Sotheby's sales was the sole occasion when Ruskin manuscripts were sold or given away
                    (see <ref type="essay" target="provenance_essay.html">Essay on Provenance</ref>), but the 1931 sale was nonetheless significant for the continuing dispersal of early manuscripts.</p>
                <p>In the Ruskin manuscript portion of the sale, lot 27 included 7 items, of which 5 were early manuscripts
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#SOTHEBYCAT1931">Sotheby &#x0026; Co., <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Final Portion of the Manuscripts &#x0026; Library of John Ruskin</hi></ref>, 6).
                    The catalogue, unlike that for the 1930 sale, does not identify these manuscripts using the roman-numeral designations that Collingwood established in
                    &#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D; for the <hi ref="italic">Poems</hi> (1891). That source may have supplied summary descriptions of the contents of two manuscripts
                    (MS VI, MS X), but the other three early manuscripts in this lot are not found in the &#x201C;Preliminary Note,&#x201D; since they probably did not exist as a bound compilation at that time.</p>
                <p>In fact, if in the 1930 sale the lots containing early manuscripts were presented as if stamped with the scholarly imprimatur of Collingwood's <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)&#x2014;and
                    with no reference to the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.xml">Library Edition</ref> (see
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.html">Sotheby's Sale of Ruskin Manuscripts and Library, 1930</ref>)&#x2014;the lots
                    in the 1931 sale seem associated more with Cook and Wedderburn's activities.
                    Instead of the elegant blue-morocco bindings and slipcases, which had been constructed for most of the early manuscripts gathered for the 1930 sale,
                    and at least some of which bindings had probably been made when Collingwood was editing <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891),
                    most of the manuscripts in the 1931 sale were bound in "cloth"&#x2014;that is, the red buckram used when the editors were working through the editing of the Library Edition
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_brantwood_note.php">Provenance of Early Manuscripts at Brantwood</ref>).</p>
                <p>Of the seven items in lot 27, the following five pertain to <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>:
                    <list type="ordered">

                            "First drafts of the Iteriad and other Poems. Essay on the Comparative Advantages of Music and Painting (1838); Macbeth (prose)." This description of the contents could have been summarized
                            from Collingwood, &#x201C;Preliminary Note,&#x201D; or from the revised version of the &#x201C;Preliminary Note,&#x201D; in the Library Edition.</item>

                <p>Sotheby’s 1931.—Much clearer documentation traces juvenilia included in lot 27 of the second Sotheby’s sale, 18 May 1931. Item I of lot 27 is MS VI; item II is MS IA; item III is MS X; item IV is MS XB; and item V is MS IVD (Sotheby Cat. 1931, 6). (A significant item formerly in MS X, the 1830 diary, had been separated prior to the sale. See TLC, 4; RBB, 49; and Sharp below.) In his memoirs, Goodspeed mentions purchasing the items in this lot (YB 267–68), and he later issued an undated catalog of Goodspeed’s Book Shop listing the entirety of lot 27 as “manuscripts 1825–1840” (Goodspeed, Cat., items 79–83, pp. 18–22). Goodspeed was a major bidder at the 18 May sale, buying not just “one or two more manuscripts” (RBB, 138) but at the very least lots 27–29 and 31, with each of these lots comprising numerous and varied manuscripts.
                    Three of the early manuscripts that came into Goodspeed’s possession (MSS IVD, VI, XB) were sold in 1939 to the Princeton University Library, along with several other items that he had acquired at the 1931 sale—a quite ambitious purchase by the library.	The final item in Thorp’s description consists of six notebooks, including two containing studies for The Seven Lamps of Architecture. I have not been able to examine these, and they are difficult to trace in the published accounts. I find no such specific listing in Goodspeed, Cat., unless the six were included in item 40, sixteen “Sketch Books” (p. 11); however, only eight of the sixteen were known to have remained to Goodspeed in 1933, when the dealer offered them along with all his Ruskin drawings to Whitehouse, and Whitehouse is believed to have acquired this lot in 1936 (RBB 138–39). I am also unable to find a listing specifically matching the Princeton notebooks in the Sotheby’s catalogs. They might have formed part of lot 122, “Miscellaneous Note Books,” from the 1930 sale, of which Hogan lists only nine as coming to Yale through Goodspeed (pp. 67–68; and see n. 31, above). The notebooks might also have derived from the 20 May 1931 Sotheby’s sale of Ruskin drawings, at which Goodspeed was represented by Ralph Brown (RBB, 138; and see, e.g., Sotheby & Co., Catalogue of the Collection of Pictures and Drawings, formerly the property of the late Professor John Ruskin . . . , 20 May 1931, item 9). Prior to the Princeton purchase, Goodspeed had offered all his Ruskin drawings to Whitehouse, who finally agreed to a purchase in 1936 (RBB, 136–39). Although the correspondence suggests that Goodspeed sent all the drawings in his possession for Whitehouse’s approval and that Whitehouse retained the entire lot, in 1944 Goodspeed was still able to donate fourteen “drawings and paintings” to Yale, following the dealer’s 1941 fire.
                    A decade after the Sotheby sale, the items remaining from lot 27 that were not sold to Princeton remained in Goodspeed’s house when it caught fire in February 1941 (Hogan, 69). Having rescued many books and manuscripts from the catastrophe, Goodspeed began making gifts of Ruskin manuscripts to Yale, starting in March 1941 with the manuscript of Praeterita. The items remaining from the 1931 purchase of juvenilia (MSS IA, X) were also fortunately rescued, and these were donated to Yale in 1942 and 1943. The contents of MSS IA and X had been disassembled from Wedderburn’s bindings, many individual items had been charred around the edges, and a few may have been destroyed completely.	These acquisition notices in YULG mention only one other manuscript, the Laws of Fiesole, of those that Goodspeed purchased in 1931 and that have not been otherwise accounted for in the preceding discussion (see also part 2, MS IA, “Description”). . . . [information to come] The reconstruction of the contents of MSS IA and X, before and after Goodspeed’s fire, requires detailed discussion, which is provided in part 2.
                    Throughout this edition, the preceding discussion is designated in shorthand as Sotheby’s 1931.</p>

                            The catalogue was not only handsomely designed and printed, and generously illustrated with reproductions of drawings, photographs, and manuscripts;
                            it was also a worthy scholarly achievement. The <date when="1931">1931</date>

                            described the lots sketchily and in briefest terms, making no effort to reference <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02bc;s

                            basic scholarly responsibility that the <date when="1930">1930</date> catalogue had observed. Many of the items in lots 27&#x2013;30 were miscellanies of manuscripts, assembled and bound in red buckram
                            in the course of <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02bc;s labor on the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>. The <title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s catalogue</title> described these compilations by citing a few titles of individual manuscripts apparently at random.
                            In <title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCAT"><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s catalogue</title>, while the red&#x2010;buckram&#x2010;bound compilations were maintained in their integrity
                            as they had come from <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName>, each of the items contained therein are separately and accurately described with their respective titles,
                            dates of composition, number of pages, medium, and in some cases dimensions. Many of the items&#x02bc; descriptions are enhanced, moreover, with sample transcriptions
                            from a manuscript, or with substantial quotations from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s works to contextualize an item. While <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> must have found the time for such meticulous care
                            owing to slow sales&#x2014;the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> sales fell at the start of the Great Depression&#x2014;the dealer far exceeded his basic responsibility and lavished his extensive understanding of and affection for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s work on the catalogue.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s affection is especially marked in his descriptions of the juvenilia. For example, the catalogue provides detailed description of &#x201c;four very early MSs&#x201d;,
                            including the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> draft fragments of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>. The item is illustrated by 23 lines of verse, which <persName corresp="#JR">Goodspeed</persName> would have to have transcribed himself,
                            and contextualized with the relevant passage in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> describing how <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> read <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> during boyhood travels to <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>

                            The enthusiasm for these early manuscripts carried over to <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s memoir: although his wide&#x2010;ranging acquisitions from the <date when="1931">1931</date> sale take up more than ten pages

                        <p><persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName>&#x02bc;s bibliographical article mentions some holdings by <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>, which cause confusion because seeming to overlap

                            <hi rend="italic">Essay on Baptism</hi>&#x201d;
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#YALECOLLECTION"><title type="essay" corresp="#YALECOLLECTION">&#x201C;The Yale Collection of the Manuscripts of John Ruskin&#x201D;</title></ref>, 64).
                            This is a draft of the essay contained in the &#x201c;Architectural Note Book&#x201d;, <date notBefore="1850" notAfter="1851">1850&#x2013;51</date>, acquired from <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> in <date when="1930">1930</date>
                            (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php#YALE"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1930">1930</date>: <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, the <date when="1930">1930</date> Acquisitions, and <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale University Library</orgName></ref>).
                            It is distinct from the 39&#x2010;folio page holograph of the essay, bound in red buckram, which <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> sold to <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName>.</p>

                        <p>A second, more puzzling overlapping pair of acquisitions is <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName>&#x02bc;s and <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>&#x02bc;s holdings of manuscript and proofs related to
                            <title type="book" corresp="#JRSTORMCLOUD"><hi rend="italic">The Storm Cloud of the Nineteenth Century</hi></title>.
                            The <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName> holding clearly corresponds to <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s catalogue description of the &#x201c;MS. and proof sheets of the principal part of the work in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s autograph,
                            comprising 43 folio pp. (with 3 pp. in the hand of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s cousin, <persName corresp="#JSAR">Mrs. Severn</persName>), bound in red cloth&#x201d;

                            It is disconcerting, therefore, that <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName> notes the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> <title type="book" corresp="#JRSTORMCLOUD"><hi rend="italic">Storm Cloud</hi></title> bound item of manuscript and proofs as having been
                            &#x201c;sold at <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02bc;s</orgName> on <date when="1931-05-18">May 18, 1931</date>&#x201d; and brought &#x201c;to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> by purchase from Mr. <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x201d;

                            The <placeName type="building" corresp="#BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke Library</placeName> does presently own the item to which <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName> was apparently referring, but it is quite different from <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName>&#x02bc;s. The <placeName type="building" corresp="#BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke</placeName> record describes:
                            &#x201c;Wrappers and separate title pages for each lecture bound in; wrapper for 1st lecture bound in before general t.p. 32 cm. Binder&#x02bc;s stamp: Bound by Zaehnsdorf. Bound with mounted corrected proof (7 leaves) for pages 48&#x2013;63, and approximately 14 pages of manuscript additions.
                            These are inserted after Part I of the printed text&#x201d;. This description corresponds to an item in the &#x201c;Quotation&#x201d; from the <date when="1931">1931</date> sale that <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> provided to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>:
                            &#x201c;&#x2018;<title type="book" corresp="#JRSTORMCLOUD">Storm Cloud of 19th Century</title>&#x2019;. Galleys with corrections. Fourteen pp. in author&#x02bc;s ms&#x201d;. The description is also consistent with <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName>&#x02bc;s less precise description,
                            &#x201c;part of the manuscript and some proof&#x201d;. According to Sara Powell, research librarian at the <placeName type="building" corresp="#BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke</placeName>, this item has not heretofore been easily locatable in the <placeName type="building" corresp="#BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke</placeName>&#x02bc;s catalogue,
                            because classified as a printed work (BEIN Ruskin &#x002b;884ta) rather than as a manuscript (email communication to <persName corresp="#DCH">David C. Hanson</persName>, <date when="2019-11-19">19 November 2019</date>).
                            What remains baffling are the respective provenances of of the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> and <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName> holdings. It seems clear that,
                            since the description of a <title type="book" corresp="#JRSTORMCLOUD"><hi rend="italic">Storm Cloud</hi></title> item in <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s &#x201c;Quotation&#x201d; for <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> closely corresponds to the current <placeName type="building" corresp="#BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke</placeName> description,
                            and since <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> offered his <date when="1931">1931</date> <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s acquisitions to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> eight years before selling to <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName>,
                            the provenance of the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> <title type="book" corresp="#JRSTORMCLOUD"><hi rend="italic">Storm Cloud</hi></title> bound manuscript and proofs can reasonably be traced to the <date when="1931">1931</date> <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s auction.
                            The original description in the <date when="1931">1931</date> <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby &#x0026; Co.</orgName>, <title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi></title></ref>,
                            is unhelpfully vague: &#x201c;<title type="book" corresp="#JRSTORMCLOUD">Storm Cloud of the XIX Century</title>. Corrected proofs with long autograph additions, <date when="1884">1884</date>&#x201d; (lot 29, item V [p. 7]).
                            The characterization of the manuscript portion as &#x201c;additions&#x201d;, however, appears to line up with the descriptions in <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s &#x201c;Quotation&#x201d; and in the current <placeName type="building" corresp="#BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke</placeName> catalogue.
                            Unless the <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName> <title type="book" corresp="#JRSTORMCLOUD"><hi rend="italic">Storm Cloud</hi></title> item also formed part of the original <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s <date when="1931">1931</date> lot, therefore, its provenance prior to <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s possession is in doubt.
                            Yet this tentative conclusion is unsettled by the items&#x02bc; respective bindings. The <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> item is encased in a decorated Zaehnsdorf binding,
                            whereas the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s <date when="1931">1931</date> catalogue description of lot 29 ascribes &#x201c;folio cloth&#x201d; bindings to each of its items. The <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> <title type="book" corresp="#JRSTORMCLOUD"><hi rend="italic">Storm Cloud</hi></title> catalogue item
                            is likewise described as bound in &#x201c;red cloth&#x201d;&#x2014;the binding that was typically used for the <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName> manuscripts

                            (see <title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCAT"><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi></title>, no. 95 [p. 26]).
                            The other two unsold items from lot 28&#x2014;Item II, manuscript of &#x201c;Lecture on Modern Art&#x201d; (British Institution, <date when="18767">1867</date>), and Item VIII, manuscript of <hi rend="italic">The Three Colours of Pre&#x2010;Raphaelitism</hi>

                            in the current catalogues of either the <placeName type="building" corresp="#BEINECKELIBRARY">Beinecke Library</placeName> or the <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName> University Library and therefore can be presumed to have been lost in <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s fire,
                            pending further discovery and identification.</p>

                        <p>One item, lecture 5 of <title type="book" corresp="#JRARTOFENGLAND"><hi rend="italic">The Art of England</hi></title>,
                            which is described as &#x201c;page proofs&#x201d; and attributed to <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s gift in
                            <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BEINECKERUSKINFINDINGAID"><orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke Library</orgName>, &#x201C;Guide to the John Ruskin Collection&#x201D;</ref>,
                            notes that &#x201c;the edges of the pages are charred, affecting the text&#x201d;, so this manuscript obviously came through the fire (p. 41).
                            This item may have formed part of lot 17 in the <date when="1931">1931</date> <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby &#x0026; Co.</orgName>, <title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi></title></ref>,
                            which describes, however, a &#x201c;reading copy . . . with corrections and additions in the Author&#x02bc;s handwriting&#x201d; (p. 5).
                            The item is not listed in <title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCAT"><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi></title>.</p>

                        <p>Two items of lot 29 (&#x201c;Prose Writings, <date notBefore="1881" notAfter="1885">1881&#x2013;85</date>&#x201d;), which <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> sold neither to <orgName corresp="#PRINCETON">Princeton</orgName> nor <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>, also are not identifiable in the current catalogues of either library
                            and therefore likewise can be presumed lost, pending further discovery and identification: Item I, manuscript, notes, and proofs of
                            <title type="book" corresp="#JRLOVESMEINIE"><hi rend="italic">Loves Meinie</hi></title>, and Item IV, manuscript and notes on the <title type="essay" corresp="#JRLAWSOFPLATO"><title type="book" corresp="#PLATOLAWS"><hi rend="italic">Laws</hi></title> of <persName corresp="#PLATO">Plato</persName></title>

                        <p>Further reserarch is pending regarding the whereabouts of the 150 letters from various correspondents to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> that formed part of lot 17,
                            the 6 letters (<date when="1858">1858</date>) to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s father that formed lot 31, and the artwork that formed lot 25.</p>


                    <!--<p>, along with several other items that he had acquired
                    at the <date when="1931">1931</date> sale&#x2010;a quite ambitious purchase by the library.	The final item in Thorp&#x02BC;s description
                    consists of six notebooks, including two containing studies for <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRSEVENLAMPS">The Seven Lamps of Architecture</title>.
                    I have not been able to examine these, and they are difficult to trace in the published accounts.
                    I find no such specific listing in <title type="catalog_auction" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCAT"><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, Cat.</title>,
                    unless the six were included in item 40, sixteen &#x201C;Sketch Books&#x201D; (p. 11);
                    however, only eight of the sixteen were known to have remained to <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> in <date when="1933">1933</date>,
                    when the dealer offered them along with all his <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drawings to <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName>,
                    and <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName> is believed to have acquired this lot in <date when="1936">1936</date> (RBB 138&#x2013;39).
                    I am also unable to find a listing specifically matching the <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Princeton</orgName> notebooks
                    in the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> catalogs. They might have formed part of lot 122,
                    <title type="manuscript" corresp="#SOTHEBY1931MISCELLANEOUSNOTEBOOKS">&#x201C;Miscellaneous Note Books&#x201D;</title>,
                    from the <date when="1930">1930</date> sale, of which <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName> lists only nine as coming to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>
                    through <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> (pp. 67&#x2013;68; and see n. 31, above).
                    The notebooks might also have derived from the <date when="1931-05-20">20 May 1931</date> <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> sale
                    of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drawings, at which <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> was represented by
                    <persName corresp="#RBROWN">Ralph Brown</persName> (RBB, 138; and see, e.g., <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby &#x0026; Co.</orgName>,

                    <date when="1931-05-20">20 May 1931</date>, item 9). Prior to the <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Princeton</orgName> purchase,
                    <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> had offered all his <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drawings to <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName>,
                    who finally agreed to a purchase in <date when="1936">1936</date> (RBB, 136&#x2013;39). Although the correspondence suggests
                    that <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> sent all the drawings in his possession for <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName>&#x02BC;s approval
                    and that <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName> retained the entire lot,
                    in <date when="1944">1944</date> <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> was still able to donate fourteen &#x201C;drawings and paintings&#x201D;
                    to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>, following the dealer&#x02BC;s <date when="1941">1941</date> fire.</p>-->
