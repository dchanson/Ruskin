            <div class="p">In <span class="date-1847-03">March 1847</span>, when <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> wrote to his friend, <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/harrison_w_h_note.php");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-WHH">W.

                        to affirm his intention to have a collection of his son&#x02BC;s poems printed, he referred to having &#x201C;had for a very long time a Volume of yours containing some light pieces of my son&#x201D;. 
                        In other words, before the <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1850"><i>Poems</i> (<span class="date-1850">1850</span>)</span> was realized, the family and friends 
                        produced and made use of compilations of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poems (<span class="title-letter-jjr_to_whh_1847-03-08"><span class="placeName-LEEDS">Leeds</span>, <span class="date-1847-03-08">8 March 1847</span></span>, in

                        The &#x201C;volume&#x201D; mentioned in this letter probably refers to a present from <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> for the holiday season of <span class="date-1844-12-25">Christmas 1844</span> and <span class="date-1845-01-01">New Year&#x02BC;s 1845</span>.

            <div class="p">On <span class="date-1845-01-04">4 January 1845</span>, while spending a disagreeably unseasonal holiday at the seaside with his family in <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> thanked <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> for the &#x201C;trouble you have taken to get me a Set of

                        referring to <span class="persName-JR">John</span> by the pen name he used for most of his contributions to annuals 
                        (<span class="title-letter-jjr_to_whh_1845-01-04">letter</span>, in <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#RFMSL5");?>" target="_self"><span class="title-manuscript-RFMSL5"><span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> to <span class="persName-WHH">W.

                        The current location of this volume, if extant, is unknown, so its contents cannot now be determined. If limited, as <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> indicates, to contributions to

                        the choice was logical as a gift from the former editor (<span class="date-1836-1841">1836&#x2013;41</span>) of that annual&#x2014;and an editor 
                        who had grown particularly close to the Ruskin family during that tenure. Given the history of his relationship with the Ruskins, it seems no coincidence that the holiday season 
                        of <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>&#x02BC;s gift also marked the end of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s regular appearances in the holiday gift annual that had brought them together, 
                        <span class="title-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>. After having contributed annually to the volumes for <span class="date-1835-1844">1835 through 1844</span>,

            <div class="p">Possibly the &#x201C;set&#x201D; of poems described by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> in this letter was the same item as the collection of &#x201C;proofs of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s contributions 
          to <span class="title-annual-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>&#x201D; that, according to the editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>,

                        and it was also intended for ease of reference. As <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> commented later in the year to <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>, 
                        he was often frustrated by &#x201C;the Scatterment&#x201D; of his son&#x02BC;s poems published in annuals over several years; it was &#x201C;the Looking for the needle in the Bundle of Hay

                        As a holograph manuscript, it does not answer to the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>&#x02BC;s description of <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>&#x02BC;s 
          bound proofs. Another possible indication of a provenance disconnected from <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> is the omission of certain transcriptions&#x2014;for example, the poem

            <div class="p">While the hand responsible for the <span class="title-manuscript-EDMONDMS">&#x201C;Edmond manuscript&#x201D;</span> has not been identified, the physical item does make a good fit 
                        with circumstances mentioned by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> in his <span class="title-letter-jjr_to_whh_1847-03-08"><span class="date-1847-03-08">8 March 1847</span> letter</span> quoted above, in which 
                        <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> declares his intention to have <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poems printed. After thanking <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> for his &#x201C;volume&#x201D;, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> goes on: &#x201C;I have delayed having them &#x005B;<span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;verses&#x201D;&#x005D; penned because I want to get the best 
                        of all he has ever penned selected &#x0026; printed in good Type&#x201D;. The <i>penning</i> clearly refers to a copyist&#x02BC;s work at the behest of <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, preliminary to publication. 
                        In <span class="date-1845">1845</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> followed a similar procedure in having <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s letters from <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> copied, preparatory to publishing them as an epistolary travel narrative. As <span class="persName-HIS">Harold Shapiro</span> 
                        explains in his edition of the letters, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> &#x201C;carefully preserved them, of course, and put them in order. More than that, the originals are full of his markings. He numbered them, 
                        supplied missing dates and places in the headings, made notations on them for a copyist, underlined the passages to be copied, cancelled details to be omitted, and even inserted a word 
                        here and there&#x201D; (<a href="<?php echo r_build_url("notes/bibliography.php#RUSKININITALY");?>" target="_self"><span class="persName-HIS">Shapiro</span>, introduction to <span class="title-book-"><i>Ruskin in Italy</i></span></a>, xx). 
                        While no such editorial markings by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> are evident in the <span class="title-manuscript-EDMONDMS">&#x201C;Edmond manuscript&#x201D;</span>, its very exacting transcriptions 
                        might represent a stage in the evolving plans toward a printed volume; and while the existence of this manuscript seems to conflict with <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s statement that he had &#x201C;delayed&#x201D; 
                        transcription of <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s poems, the manuscript may have been rejected as a false start, given <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s requirements in <span class="date-1847">1847</span>. As explained in the 
                        <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/edmond_ms_apparatus.php#DESCRIPTION");?>" target="_self">description</a> of the manuscript, the transcriptions are not &#x201C;selected&#x201D;, 
                        as <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> now wanted&#x2014;starting, as they do, with <a href="<?php echo r_build_url("apparatuses/#SALTZBURG_apparatus.php");?>" target="_self">
               <span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span></a>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s first poem published in 
                        <span class="title-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>, 
                        which was not ultimately chosen for inclusion in the <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1850">Poems (<span class="date-1850">1850</span>)</span>&#x2014;and the sequence of transcriptions is faulty, foundering on a mistake in transcription of the poems for 
                        <span class="date-1842">1842</span>. Nonetheless, regardless of whether this manuscript is related directly to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s project of printing the <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1850">Poems</span> in <span class="date-1850">1850</span>, 
                        the manuscript attests at the very least to the interest <span class="date">before 1850</span> in collecting <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poems scattered throughout published annuals.

                    Now, when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> departed for <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> in <span class="date-1845-04">April 1845</span>, 
                        his first Continental tour without his parents&#x02BC; direct supervision, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> grew more outspoken about losing interest in verse composition. 
                        Although continuing to oblige his father by sending home new poems for publication, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> paraded his indifference and even contempt: 
                        &#x201C;Of course do all that you like with poems. <span class="persName-MGBLESSINGTON">Lady B&#x005B;lessington&#x005D;</span> just as good as any one. I have neither pride nor pleasure in them&#x201D;. 
                        On his father&#x02BC;s birthday, he wrote less flippantly, but more decisively, explaining that his poetical impulse was dulled by a critical temper, which he regarded as superior: 
                    &#x201C;I almost always see two sides of a thing at once, now&#x2014;in matters poetical&#x2014;&#x0026; I never get strongly excited without perceiving drawbacks &#x0026; imperfections 
                    which somehow one lost sight of when one was younger&#x201D;
