                W<hi rend="smallcaps">hile</hi> the Conductors and Publishers of
                these interesting and beautiful little volumes
                watch over their contents, and take care of
                the religious and moral character which be&#x2010;
                longs to them, we shall deem it our duty to
                encourage them. If their Editors do not
                choose to give them a decidedly religious
                aspect, which we by no means think indis&#x2010;
                pensable, let them at least guard against
                everything that could, by the most distant
                construction, militate against the interests of
                vital godliness; and let them ever replenish
                them with such articles as will improve the
                heart, while they enlighten the judgment. If
                we could reach a word to the writers of all
                such volumes, it would be&#x2014;&#x201C;Take heed of an
                airy, vapouring, and sentimental style of
                writing, which both weakens and depraves
                the mind. Let the good, the solid, the useful,
                the truly entertaining, be the materials with
                which you grace your beautiful pages.&#x201D;
                    <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> abounds, in every
                page, with what is sprightly and instructive,
                and is altogether one of the most pleasing
                tokens of regard that can well be put into
                the hand of a friend. The writing, with
                few exceptions, is solid and good, and the
                engravings are such as to please an eye
                accustomed to judge accurately in such
                matters. &#x201C;The Comforts of Conceited&#x2010;
                ness,&#x201D; is a well&#x2010;conceived, well&#x2010;written tale;
                and of the pleasingly ludicrous, it is a fine
                specimen. Alas! that there should be so
                many in real life who resemble Mr. Honey&#x2010;
                wood! The essay, &#x201C;On Housekeepers,&#x201D; is
                both humorous and characteristic, and the
                moral is excellent. Many of the engravings
                are highly meretorious; especially the &#x201C;La
                Villegiattira,&#x201D; &#x201C;The Cottage Diorama,&#x201D;
                and &#x201C;The Captive Slave.&#x201D;
                    <title type="annual" corresp="#WINTERSWREATH"><hi rend="italic">The Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi></title> differs from the
                    former volume, by its possessing a more de&#x2010;
                cidedly religious character; although, in
                other respects, it is by no means superior to
                it. It is, however, a very highly creditable
                volume to those who have had the production
                of it; and is fitted to be very useful to the
                rising generation, as well as very entertain&#x2010;
                ing. The sketch and beautiful portrait of
                the lamented <persName corresp="#RHBC">Bishop Heber</persName> will be very ac&#x2010;
                ceptable to the public. We can give this
                volume a very hearty welcome. If there are
                any profits from the sale of it, they are to be
                devoted to charitable purposes.

                <p>The extraordinary increase of A<hi rend="smallcaps">nnuals</hi>
                renders it impossible to notice them all, or,
                indeed, to do justice to any one of them. We
                introduced two of the most respectable of
                them to our readers last month, and we shall
                now briefly sketch the character of a few more;
                without, however, venturing a decisive opinion
                as to their comparitive merits. We are
                friendly to the general plan pursued in these
                elegant publications; but we wish to see the
                authors of some of them aiming at a more
                scrupulous selection of materials.
                    <title type="annual" corresp="##FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> has been got up under
                    the superintendence of <persName corresp="#TP">Mr. Pringle</persName>, a gentle&#x2010;
                man whose exertions in the cause of humanity
                entitle him to much confidence and respect.
                In his editorial functions he has displayed
                considerable literary taste, and, as far as com&#x2010;
                ported with the design of his undertaking, a
                becoming regard to the great interests of re&#x2010;
                vealed truth. <title type="poem" corresp="#PRINGLEBECHUANABOY">&#x201C;The Bechuana Boy,&#x201D;</title> by the
                Editor, is, beyond doubt, the finest contribu&#x2010;
                tion in the volume, as it illustrates that fear&#x2010;
                ful state of things which has so long obtained
                in the <placeName corresp="#CAPECOLONY">colony of the Cape</placeName>, but which, by the
                Divine blessing on the exertions of Dr. Philip,
                has, we trust, for ever passed away. It cannot
                fail to interest the friends of freedom and reli&#x2010;
                gion. <persName corresp="#JMPOET">Mr. Montgomery</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#MONTGOMERYCRYFROMSOUTHAFRICA">&#x201C;Cry from South
                Africa&#x201D;</title> will tend to perpetuate his fame both
                as a poet and as the tried friend of human
                kind. The embellishments are very superior.
                An immense sum must have been spent both
                upon the drawings and engravings. The vo&#x2010;
                lume is altogether very creditable to the
                editor and publishers.
