                <p>Readers of Praeterita are familiar with Ruskin's description of the "trevelling chariot" used for the family's summer holidays, 
                    which was lent by John James's business partner, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="telford_henry_note.php">Henry Telford (d. 1859)</ref>, 
                    in the years of Ruskin's youth, "before my father thought it right to hire a carriage" for long journeys (Ruskin, Works, 35:29). 
                    In documentary evidence related to the Ruskins' 1827 journey to Scotland, John James lists a small expense 
                    connected with &#x201c;chaise Perth&#x201d;--presumably, the Telford carriage driven to Perth, 
                    since the terms <hi rend="italic">post chaise</hi>, <hi rend="italic">posting chariot</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">travelling chariot</hi> describe the same type of vehicle

                <p>Surviving examples of the post-chaise or traveling chariot from the early nineteenth century can be viewed at the National Trust Carriage Museum at Arlington. 
                    As the museum's guidebook explains, the term <hi rend="italic">chariot</hi> refers to the "shape of the body", seating only two passengers--or as Ruskin comments in Praeterita, 
                    "two persons and so much of third personage as I possessed at three years old"--on a "seat behind the doors" and facing the windows in the front and on the sides. 
                    This configuration contrasts with the design of the heavier <hi rend="italic">coach</hi>, which seated "four inside the body"--two couples facing one another, 
                    one couple on "a seat ahead of the doors" that opened in the middle of the coach body, and the other couple on a seat "behind" the doors. 
                    Ruskin's seat as a small boy "was the little box containing my clothes, strongly made, with a cushion on one end of it", which, "set upright in front (and well forward)", 
                    afforded him a "horizon of sight the widest possible" through the large front windows and the adjacent side windows on the doors. 
                    While Ruskin says he "was thus not the least in . . . [his parents'] way", his box would have obstructed a set of two folding panels that--if 
                    so equipped, and as explained by the Carriage Museum--could "be let down" from the wall beaneath the windows, 
                    enabling "the inside passengers to stretch their legs at full length into the boot and sleep while they travelled". 
                    Perhaps John's box could have been shifted to one side to let down one of the two panels. The other would not have been required for Ruskin's mother . . .
