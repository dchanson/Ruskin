                <p>Engravers, based in London. The brothers worked jointly, overseeing a large workshop employing many assistants and pupils of the trade. 
                    They specialized in landscape, although they also undertook many portraits. 
                    William's achievements in steel-engraving include the vignettes after Stothard for Samuel Rogers's <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> (1830) 
                    and Rogers's <hi rend="italic"> Poems</hi> (1834), complementing Edward Goodall's work after Turner for those volumes. 
                    Edward's well-known works include the plates for William Brockedon's 
                    <hi rend="italic">Illustrations of the Passes of the Alps</hi> (1827-29). 
                    The brothers enjoyed a long relationship with the firm of John Murray, for example contributing significantly to the 1841 edition of 
                    Byron's <hi rend="italic">Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</hi>.
                </p>
                <p>The Findens attempted publishing in their own right, 
                    issuing for example <hi rend="italic">Finden's Landscape Illustrations to Mr. Murray's First Complete and Uniform Edition of the Life and Works of Lord Byron</hi> 
                    (1832-34). Because these projects proved so ambitious, however, the brothers ultimately relied on collaborations with other publishers. Such was the case, for example, 
                    with <hi rend="italic">Finden's Landscape Illustrations to the Bible</hi> (1834-37).
