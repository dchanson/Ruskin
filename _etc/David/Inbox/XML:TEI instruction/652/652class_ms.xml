                        I weary for the torrent leaping
                        from off the <mountain> scars [steep face of rock on mountainside] rough crest
                            My muse is on the mountain sleeping
                            My harp is sunk to rest
                            
                            I weary for the fountain foaming
                            for shady holme [flat land near river, tending to flood; northern/Scottish word] & hill
                            My mind is on the mountain roaming
                            My lyres voice is still.
                            
                            I weary for the woodland brook
                            that wanders through the vale
                            <del>That</del> I weary for the heights that look
                            adown upon the dale
                            
                            The crags are lone on Conistone [sic]
                            & <del>Glaramaras</del> Loweswaters dell
                            And dreary on the mighty one
                            The cloud enwreathed Scawfell
                            Oh what although the crags be stern
                            Their craggy peaks that sever
                            Fresh flies the breeze on mountain fern
                            And free on mountain heather
                            
                            There is [a(?)]1 thrill of strange delight
                            That passeth quivering oer me
                            When blue hills fade upon the sight
                            Like summer clouds before2
                            
                            Tis transient, as the <winters> snowy drift3
                                That passeth away4
                                [Its or Tis] like the blush of morn that swift
                                Doth melt into the day
                                
                                I long to tread the mountain head
                                Above the valley swelling
                                I long to feel the breeze fled5
                                From grey & gaunt Helvellyn.
                                
                                I love the eddying circling sweep
                                The mantling and the foam
                                Of murmuring waters dark and deep
                                Amid the valleys lone
                                
                                It is a terror, yet tis sweet
                                Upon some broken brow
                                To look upon the distant sweep
                                Of <lake or> ocean spread below
                                    
                                    1The word in ms. is unquestionably written as at, not a, but Ruskin probably unconsciously added the t in anticipation of the next word, thrill.
                                    2Although demanded by the rhyme, me does not complete this line, as it does in John Jamesâ€™s editing.
                                    3This stanza is roughly scored through in pencil by John James.
                                    4These three words are widely spaced, as if Ruskin meant to fill in a word to complete the meter.
                                    5Next to fled, John James wrote in pencil sped, which is the word used in 1850.</l>
                    
                    <l>And sleeplessly counting the moments Hay</l>
                    <l>I thought of the joys that my bosom should know</l>
                    <l>Of the rich tides of pleasure unmingled which flow</l>
                    <l>Unmingled with grief and unmingled with gall</l>
                    <l>But draughts of delight rapture banquetings all</l>
                    <l>Impatient I watched as the lingering light</l>
                    <l>Too slowly overpowered the clouds of the night</l>
                    <l>Who clothed in her star sprinkled heaven shrouding vest</l>
                    <l>Which gracefully masked her er peaceful breast</l>
                    <l>And while on her brows her dark tresses among</l>
                    <l>Which flowed soft the pale crescent benignantly shone</l>
                    <l>From the earth cheering rays of Aurora she fled</l>
                    <l>In stern winter palaces hiding her head</l>
                    <l>At length the time came when the bill being made</l>
                    <l>Boots hostler and chambermaid all duly paid</l>
                    <l>Sticks bonnets hats greatcoats all duly prepared</l>
