                <p>The family travel in the summer of 1834 is conjectural. Falling between the ambitious tours to the Continent, 
                    the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1833_note.html">Tour of 1833</ref> and 
                    the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1835_note.html">Tour of 1835</ref>, 
                    summer travel for 1834 may have been originally projected for the Continent, but then scaled back to a more modest trip inside Britain. 
                    According to Ruskin's letter of 22 February 1834, thanking his father for his birthday gifts: "It may be pleasant enough, travelling and scrambling, 
                    and sketching and hammering among the Scotch mountains, if we do not go to Switzerland next summer" (RFL, 280). No other evidence is presently known 
                    about what the family may have originally planned or where they finally went.
