                <head type="title">List of Ruskin&#x02BC;s Published Poems, 1830&#x2013;46, Compiled
                    by John James Ruskin</head>
                <p>In MS IV, long after Ruskin had abandoned his use of the notebook, his father
                    took it up to compile a list of Ruskin&#x02BC;s published poems. John James
                    may have begun compiling the list in 1845 since its longest
                    segment&#x2014;written in ink, in his florid, old&#x2010;fashioned
                    hand&#x2014;presents a sequential record of poems published between 1830
                    and 1845 (pp. 20&#x2013;31). This part of the list may have been prompted
                    by John James&#x02BC;s complaint to W. H. Harrison on 1 July 1845 that the
                    published poems were inconveniently dispersed among various
                    annuals: &#x201C;It is the scatterment of looking for a needle in the bundle
                    of hay I dislike&#x2014;I know not how to have him or where to find
                    him&#x201D; (quoted in Dearden, &#x201C;Ruskin&#x02BC;s Poems
                    1850,&#x201D; 154).</p>
                <p>Strangely, for this doting parent, John James&#x02BC;s list begins with an
                    error: the first entry reads &#x201C;on Skiddaw &#x0026; Derwent Water /
                    page 72 Spiritual Times / Feby 1830 age 11 years.&#x201D; Hence,
                    &#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D; became established as
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s first known publication, and it was as recently as 1994
                    that James S. Dearden discovered Ruskin&#x02BC;s actual debut in print,
                    which occurred, not in the February 1830 issue of the Spiritual Times, but in
                    the August 1829, with the forgotten &#x201C;Lines Written at the Lakes in
                    Cumberland.&#x201D; (In the MS IV list, John James&#x02BC;s entry is
                    scored through in pencil, which, if by him, perhaps indicates that he recognized
                    the mistake. If so, he did not correct the entry.)</p>
                <p>Following this first long segment of the list, on three following pages (p. 32,
                    plus an unnumbered leaf), John James switched to pencil to record publications
                    of 1846, along with some poems of earlier years, which he had omitted from the
                    first segment. This year was the last in which Ruskin published poetry prior to
                    the collecting of his verse in Poems (1850), with the exception
                    of &#x201C;Mont Blanc Revisited&#x201D; published in late 1849 (see
                    Ruskin, Works, 38:7) He mentions here the &#x201C;Bundle Sheets w F.
                    O.,&#x201D; likely referring to bound proofs of Ruskin&#x02BC;s
                    contributions to Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering that W. H. Harrison had
                    presented to John James, and that the doting father carried on his travels (see
                    Ruskin, Works, 2:xxxiv; Dearden, &#x201C;Ruskin&#x02BC;s Poems
                    1850,&#x201D; 154). This second stage of the list probably represents John
                    James&#x02BC;s initial preparations for Poems (1850), a project first
                    confided to Harrison in 1847 (Dearden, &#x201C;Ruskin&#x02BC;s Poems
                    1850,&#x201D; 155). Published poems omitted from this list do not appear in
                    Poems (1850).</p>
                <p>The list reads as follows, with my interpolations set in square brackets. As
                    already remarked in the Introduction, this first attempt at bibliography of
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s early writings already committed a significant error, the
                    incomplete publication information for no. 44: <list type="simple">
