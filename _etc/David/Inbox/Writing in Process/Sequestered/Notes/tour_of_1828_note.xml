                <p>The Ruskins planned a &#x201C;great tour&#x201D; of the Lake District in 1828, intended to compensate
                    for the previous, leaner years of travel, <!-- tag note -->the Tours of 1826-27, 
                    which were confined mainly to visiting family in Perth, Scotland. To plan the tour, and then to
                    record its progress, Ruskin devoted <!-- apparatus -->MS IVB (in its initial use) to 
                    <!-- tag apparatus -->Travel Itinerary and Tour Notes, 1828, which consists of itineraries and notes for this trip.
                    The planned tour of the Lakes not fulfilled until 1830, however, since the 1828 journey was 
                    interrupted on 24 May by news of the 18 May death of <!-- tag note -->Janet Richardson (&#x201C;Aunt Jessie&#x201D;), 
                    John James&#x02BC;s sister, the widow of Patrick Richardson (1774-1824) of Perth 
                    (Burd, introduction to Dearden, ed., <hi rend="italic">Tour to the Lakes in Cumberland</hi>, 7; 
                    Viljoen, Ruskin's Scottish Heritage, 185; Burd, ed., Ruskin Family Letters, xlviii-xlix; 
                    Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, 35:70-71).</p>
                <p>On the day following news of Jessie's death, John James wrote to George Gray (1798-1877), 
                    who was a family friend and solicitor in Perth, a member of Writers to the Signet, to take responsibility 
                    for his three nephews and niece--the survivors of Jessie and Patrick's ten children. The niece, 
                    Mary Richardson (1815-49), would be taken into the family around 15 July, when the Ruskins returned home 
                    (Burd, introduction to Dearden, ed., Tour to the Lakes in Cumberland, 7; 
                    Burd, ed. Ruskin Family Letters, 1:197-98 n. 1; 
                    and see Jessie Richardson [1783-1828]).</p>
                <p>The Ruskins did not terminate their journey immediately, although they did not carry through with their visit to the Lakes. 
                    On 3 June 1828, they were at Stratford-on-Avon, 
                    where John and his father signed the Visitor's Book at Shakespeare's Birthplace 
                    (Dearden, ed., Tour of the Lakes in Cumberland, 64 n. 14). In John James's accounts for 1828, 
                    entries for the two months May and June are omitted from most lists of expenses, while in the expenses for "Travelling" 
                    John James entered a total amount of &#x00A3;332 for "Journey", dated 17 July--close to the date when John James 
                    informed Gray that they would return to Herne Hill, expecting to receive Mary. (Notably missing entries for May and June 
                    is the list of "House Expenses", although for June "Servants Wages" are covered, as well as "Mrs Rs Cloaths" [sic], 
                    which lists an expense for "Harmans"--i.e., the London milliner, Harman &#x0026; Broadbent, 
                    where Margaret frequently purchased her clothing. Perhaps an order was sent for mourning dress? 
                    See John James Ruskin, Account Book [1827-45], 8v, 6v, 7v, 7r; and for Harman &#x0026; Broadbent, 
                    see Burd, ed., Ruskin Family Letters, 1:410 n. 6).
