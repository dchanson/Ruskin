                <head type="title">George Allen (1849&#x2013;1907)</head>
                <p>Ruskin&#x02BC;s personal assistant from <!--Entry needed here.-->, and his publisher
                    from 1871. Ruskin first encountered Allen in 1854 at the Working Men&#x02BC;s College.
                    Allen was pursuing art studies there to augment his developing reputation as a
                    skilled joiner and carpenter, and his abilities so sufficiently impressed Ruskin
                    <!--Correction needed here?--> that he was picked as an assistant drawing master.
                    His skill in engraving <!--Entry needed here.-->. Allen became Ruskin&#x02BC;s personal
                    assistant in <!--Entry needed here.-->, turning down offers from William Morris as a
                    founding member for furniture design in Morris, Marshall, Faulkner and Company, and
                    <!--Entry needed here.--> for care of furnishings in the Queen&#x02BC;s household.</p>
                <p>Allen&#x02BC;s devotion to his &#x201C;Master&#x201D; (upheld
                    despite periodic strains caused by Ruskin&#x02BC;s violent outbursts in
                    times of illness) combined well with his shrewd business sense to enable him to
                    realize Ruskin&#x02BC;s experiments in publishing and bookselling while
                    remaining profitable. Ruskin aimed to bypass the complex system of discounts
                    that growing up between publishers and trade as a result of cheaper printing
                    methods, widening of the reading public (including demands
                    for &#x201C;self&#x2010;culture&#x201D; by the working classes), and
                    competing influences of the subscription libraries and booksellers. All this
                    encouraged dissemination of &#x201C;cheap classics&#x201D; without
                    regard, in Ruskin&#x02BC;s paternalistic view, for felt sacrifice in
                    obtaining value both in content and the physical quality of a book, or for fair
                    royalties to authors supporting new writing (although later, by 1882, Allen
                    eased Ruskin&#x02BC;s resistance to inexpensive editions of his works).
                    Ruskin proposed establishing the same consistent and open prices for trade and
                    public alike, providing fair return to both author and publisher (Allen agreed
                    with Ruskin for a third of profits, which continued after Ruskin&#x02BC;s
                    death) while exposing any additional price added by a middleman.</p>
                <p>Ruskin laid out these principles in <hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi>
                    ([1871&#x2013;<!--Entry needed here.-->]; see, e.g., Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> <!--Entry needed here.-->),
                    inaugurating them with the monthly publication of those pamphlets as well as
                    with the Works Series. Allen printed and distributed the pamphlets from his home
                    in Kent, first at Heathfield Cottage, Keston, and then, from 1874 as the
                    business grew, at Sunnyside, Orpington&#x2014;the familiar imprint for
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s part&#x2010;publications throughout the 1870s and 1880s.
                    At first, the pastoral village setting, while charming to both <!--Correction needed here?-->
                    Allen and Ruskin&#x02BC;s sense of the place of
                    handcraftsmanship in English life, caused practical difficulties that the
                    cosmopolitan London book trade was swift to ridicule. But <!--Entry needed here.--></p>
                <p>Through contentious negotiations with Smith and Elder, Ruskin&#x02BC;s
                    publisher through 1871 (including, initially, joint responsibility with Allen
                    for <hi rend="italic">Fors</hi>), Ruskin finally obtained in <!--Entry needed here.--> copyright of
                    his earlier works and, in 1878, purchase of engraved plates. For Ruskin, the
                    relations with Smith and Elder were painfully bound up with relations with his
                    father, who until his death had managed his son&#x02BC;s publishing
                    affairs. Despite bitter emotions that colored the negotiations, the decision to
                    transfer all his titles to Allen proved sound.</p>
                <p>Allen&#x02BC;s alertness to the market assured that steady sales of
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s works benefited both himself, who by terms of an 1887
                    agreement reaped a third of profits, and the Brantwood circle, who received <!--Entry needed here.-->.
                    Allen frequently complained about <!--Entry needed here.-->. His early skill in engraving drew him to
                    producing fine editions, although he was keenly conscious the full spectrum of
                    the market for Ruskin&#x02BC;s works. Attention to both ends of the market
                    decided the dual format of works important to the publication history of
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s juvenile work, which Allen exploited in order to expand his
                    list while operating under the unusual condition of serving, at first, as a
                    single&#x2010;author publisher. <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891), <hi
                        rend="italic">Three Letters and an Essay on Literature</hi> (1893), <hi
                        rend="italic">Letters to a College Friend</hi> (1894), and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Poetry of Architecture</hi> (<!--Entry needed here.-->) were all issued in both fine and cheap
                    editions. Before his death in 1907, Allen oversaw production and release of
                    several volumes of the Library Edition (1903&#x2013;12), the first two
                    volumes containing <hi rend="italic">Early Prose</hi> (vol. 1 [<!--Entry needed here.-->]) and <hi
                        rend="italic">Poems</hi> (vol. 2 [1903]) and incorporating
                    Allen and Collingwood&#x02BC;s earlier editions of early
                    works.</p>
                <p>Fine editions were limited and printed on handmade paper <!--Entry needed here.-->.</p>
                <p>Cheap editions were inaugurated in 1882 with the Uniform Edition in dark green or
                    reddish brown cloth, <!--Entry needed here.--> by <!--Entry needed here.--> inches, with gilt lettering on the spine. A typical
                    price was 5 shillings, up to 7/6 for longer or illustrated works. Starting in
                    <!--Entry needed here.-->, reissue was frequently from stereotype.</p>
                <p>The concern became George Allen and Sons in 1901, with Allen&#x02BC;s
                    children William, Hugh, and Grace (long active in the business) joining the
                    board. With Ruskin sales slowing, Allen sought to expand his list with other
                    offers; however, after his death in 1907, slow sales <!--Correction needed here.--> of the Library Edition
                    and the inadequate list <!--Correction needed here.--> apart from Ruskin proved a drag on the business.
                    Efforts to expand occurred in 1909 with acquisition of the publishing branch of
                    Bemrose and Sons and, in 1911, of Swan Sonnenschein &#x0026; Company, creating
                    George Allen &#x0026; Company, Ltd. The collapsed in 1913, however, and went
                    into receivership under Stanley Unwin (<!--Entry needed here.-->), who formed George Allen &#x0026;
                    Unwin in 1914. That company continued for a while to issue remaining unbound
                    stock in the Uniform Edition, sometimes with George Allen &#x0026; Unwin
                    imprinted on the spine, but high costs and uncertainties of the market in the
                    war years prevented new reprints of Ruskin.</p>
                <p>Unwin later declared he was hampered by Ruskin&#x02BC;s literary trustees,
                    whose ownership of plates and blocks constrained him to a commission basis for
                    reprints. By terms of Ruskin&#x02BC;s will, Alexander Wedderburn, one of
                    the trustees, maintained control over sales of Ruskin&#x02BC;s works.</p>
