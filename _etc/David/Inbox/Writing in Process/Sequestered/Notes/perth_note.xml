            <p>When Ruskin began visiting his Aunt Jessie and his cousins as a boy in the 1820s, Perth boasted monuments of the Scottish Enlightenment. Most notable was the new bridge (1771). . .</p>
            <p>A visit to his aunt and cousins presented Ruskin with a constant reminder of those Enlightenment monuments, as his relatives lived in Bridge End House, its name taken from
                its situation near the river, close to where the new bridge met the bank opposite
                the city. Now destroyed, it was a two-story, stone dwelling, with a basement and
                attic. See Van Akin Burd's description of the house and purchase details, and his photograph of the river view taken from the upper story
