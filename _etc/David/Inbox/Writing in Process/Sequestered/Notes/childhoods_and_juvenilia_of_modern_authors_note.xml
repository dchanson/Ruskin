                <head type="title">Juvenilia of Modern Authors</head>
                <p>In the later nineteenth century, there appears to have arisen an increased
                    interest in the childhoods and juvenilia of
                    &#x201C;modern&#x201D;&#x2014;that is, high Victorian authors. </p>
                <p>In the early nineteenth century, the interest in juvenilia as such appears to
                    have been a private concern of families. As W. G. Collingwood remarks, John
                    James and Margaret Ruskin treasured virtually everything that they and their son
                    wrote during his youth (<hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript"
                        >o</hi>, 1891], 1:262; <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [8<hi rend="superscript"
                        >o</hi>, 1891], 1:261). Authors themselves took a more equivocal view of
                    their early work. Ruskin resented his father&#x02BC;s preoccupation with
                    his early poetry at the very time when the writer, in the preparation for <hi
                        rend="italic">Stones of Venice</hi> (1850, 1853), was crucially defining
                    himself more as a critic than as a poetic prose writer. Yet, at the same time,
                    in <hi rend="italic">Modern Painters III</hi> (1854<!--Correction needed here?-->), Ruskin adopted a
                    Wordsworthian approach to history by taking his own development from childhood
                    as an example of modern landscape sensibility. Robert Browning, whose boyhood
                    shared so many influences with Ruskin&#x02BC;s in the semirural lanes and
                    evangelical chapels of Camberwell, was more reticent, destroying nearly
                    everything of importance in connection with his early writing. Leigh Hunt. . . .
                    The Brontës <!--Entry needed here.-->.</p>
                <p>As a result, Ruskin&#x02BC;s early literary development has been as admired
                    and extensively documented and studied as that of the Brontës, while
                    Browning&#x02BC;s biographers have been forced to rely on more indirect
                    sources (see Maynard). Yet, whereas Browning, having disposed of the evidence,
                    proved surprisingly insouciant in the ultimate testamentary arrangements for his
                    literary estate (see Millgate), Ruskin and his later circle of editors and
                    secretaries at Brantwood were as cautious as Browning, if not as destructive,
                    about the impression posterity would form of his early writing. Their measures
                    persist through the still standard editions, W. G. Collingwood&#x02BC;s
                    1891 edition of the <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi>, and E. T. Cook and Alexander
                    Wedderburn&#x02BC;s 1903&#x2013;12 Library Edition of
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>; and, despite monumental
                    corrective editing by Helen Gill Viljoen (much of which remains unpublished),
                    James S. Dearden, and Van Akin Burd, the earlier bibliographies and editions
                    continue profoundly to influence how the early Ruskin has been read.
                    Fortunately, it is characteristic of Ruskin that, while he and his circle
                    guarded how his writing should be approached, apparently nothing of the early
                    writing&#x2014;unlike the later correspondence with Rose
                    LaTouche&#x2014;was deliberately committed to flame. The purpose of this
                    edition is to compile the first comprehensive and reliable descriptive
                    bibliography and chronology of the early Ruskin manuscripts and to publish what
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s first editors excluded from their editions. </p>
                <p>Even now, the dispersal of the early manuscripts forces reliance on the earlier
                    editions, with all their bibliographic errors and questionable editorial
                    policies by Collingwood and Cook and Wedderburn. More recent scholars, such as
                    Burd and Dearden, have overcome the early editors&#x02BC; influence to
                    compile reliable editions of selected portions of the early writing. Until now,
                    however, no comprehensive bibliographic reconsideration of the entirety of the
                    early manuscripts has been made available. Only by means of a comprehensively
                    revised chronology and descriptive bibliography, which form the foundation of
                    this edition, can we at last fully understand the later mythologizing of
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s childhood and, behind that, the actual youthful writing in
                    all the complexity of its genius.</p>
