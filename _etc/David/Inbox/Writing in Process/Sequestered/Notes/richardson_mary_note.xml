                <p>In 1826, following the death by consumption of Ruskin&#x02BC;s cousin, James
                    Richardson, who had lived at Herne Hill, Margaret Ruskin declared a ban on
                    &#x201C;bringing ourselves under such responsibility&#x201D; as
                    adopting relatives&#x02BC; children into the household (<hi rend="italic"
                        >Ruskin Family Letters</hi> 144). Nonetheless, by April 1827, Margaret pronounced herself greatly relieved by the arrangements for Mary to live 
                    at Herne Hill for at least part of the year--a plan that was made permanent in the following year (156, 157 n. 2)<!--  Entry needed here. --></p>
                <p>A note in the <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Newsletter</hi> describing the sale of
                    Mary&#x02BC;s diaries of her tours with the Ruskins lists the dates as 17
                    June&#x2013;16 July 1833; 4 June&#x2013;25 August 1835; 22 December
                    1840&#x2013;11 March 1841; 16 March&#x2013;23 June 1841 (one volume
                    for each period); also a diary from 1849, the year she died. Gertrude Atthill
                    deposited 2 vols. of transcriptions in the Whitehouse collection, with the 1833
                    volume of transcripts running 14 May&#x2013;25 August 1833:
