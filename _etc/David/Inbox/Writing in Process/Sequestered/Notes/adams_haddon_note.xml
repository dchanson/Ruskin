                <p>Haddon C. Adams made an important bequest to the Ruskin Galleries, Bembridge,
                    which came to the Galleries on 15 September 1971, following Adams&#x02BC;s
                    death on 14 June 1971 (although he had deposited some items, including diaries
                    of John James Ruskin, prior to his death). Adams, a civil engineer and a friend
                    of John Howard Whitehouse, started collecting during a visit to Brantwood in
                    June 1928. Early work forming part of the Adams bequest included the commonplace
                    book, MS <!--Entry needed here.-->; <hi rend="italic">Little Jack</hi>, with its
                    tracings; and drawings of 1831 (a tower, signed with initials and dated 1 September
                    1831), 1832 (&#x201C;Tunbridge Castle&#x201D; [<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 38:
                    288, no. 1698]), 1835 (twelve drawings from the tour of that year), and undated
                    but possibly early copies of Prout. Work by John James Ruskin associated with
                    his son&#x02BC;s youth included his diary for 1833, and the drawing &#x0201C;Conway
                    Castle.&#x0201D; </p>
