                   <p>From 1826 to ????,<!-- establish terminus --> Ruskin&#x02BC;s poetry appears in four forms: 
                        as anthologies fair-copied in the <ref type="note" target="redbook.php">Red Books</ref> and other bound manuscripts; as single fair-copy presentations of occasional poems, 
                        such as New Year&#x02BC;s Poems; 
                        as inclusions within letters, whether as part of the text or as a separate enclosure; and, in a form of presentation that evidently was never fully realized in this earliest period of writing, 
                        as a volume-length poem&#x2014;<ref type="works" target="eudosia_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Eudosia,&#x201D;</ref> for example, apparently being intended,

                    <p>In ????, Ruskin realized the ambition of a volume-length poem with <ref type="mss" target="iteriad_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</ref> 
                        in <ref type="mss" target="msvii_apparatus.php">MS VII</ref> (albeit only briefly, as he follows &#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D; in that manuscript with an incomplete fair copy of the incompletely drafted

                            <p>Such anthologies, according to <persName>Barbara M. Benedict</persName>, encouraged their middle-class audiences to construct literature 
                                &#x201C;by responsive reading rather than by authorial control,&#x201D; the author having &#x201C;virtually disappeared from the presentation of his texts; 
                                the reader now &#x2018;takes&#x2019; the text as he wills where once he took it as the author&#x02BC;s lesson&#x201D; 
                                (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MISCELLANIES">Benedict, &#x201C;Literary Miscellanies,&#x201D;</ref> p. 409; see also
                                <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BEAUTIES">Benedict, &#x201C;&#x2018;Beauties&#x2019; of Literature,&#x201D;</ref> p. 323).
                                Ruskin does appropriate a poem by Erasmus Darwin and transform it as his own in 
                                <ref type="works" target="the_steam_engine_apparatus.php">&#x201C;When furious up from mines the water pours&#x201D; [&#x201C;The Steam Engine&#x201D;]</ref>. 
                                This evidence of reader-centeredness is offset, however, by Edgeworth&#x02BC;s training of her young readers in what one would now call <hi rend="italic">close reading</hi>. 
                                In part 2 of <hi rend="italic">Frank</hi> (1802), the boy, who is about Ruskin's age, is not told who authored lines he has heard recited by his father 
                                (the reader learns from a footnote that the author is Darwin), and Frank is cautioned by his mother that he is too young to &#x201C;&#x2018;understand the sense of them yet&#x2019;&#x201D;; nonetheless, 
                                his mother leads Frank through a close analysis of the lines' metaphor and diction that can scarcely be considered unstudious of authorized meaning 
                                (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHWORKS">Edgeworth, <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi></ref> 12: 195, and see pp. 195&#x2013;99).</p>
                            <p>Another function dramatically evident in the <ref type="works" target="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php">MS I Poetry Anthology</ref> is the &#x201C;forging&#x201D; of identity that 
                                <persName>Linda Colley</persName> characterizes as the making of Britons in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. 
                            The spring of that formation, fear of the Other (Francophobia) invading the homeland, is the most persuasive explanation 
                            for Ruskin&#x02BC;s motives in his (possibly overdetermined) poem, <ref type="works" target="the_defiance_of_war_apparatus.php">&#x201C;The Defiance of War&#x201D;</ref>. 
                                The identity thus imaginatively preserved in this poem is, in the anthology, welded both to <placeName>North Briton</placeName> and to <placeName>South</placeName>, with the poems 
                            <ref type="works" target="on_scotland_apparatus.php">&#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;</ref> and 
                            <ref type="works" target="the_steam_engine_apparatus.php">&#x201C;When furious up from mines the water pours&#x201D; [&#x201C;The Steam Engine&#x201D;]</ref>&#x2014;the 
                                latter an imitation of a poem by the English Midlands poet, <persName>Erasmus Darwin</persName>, celebrating in turn the invention by the illustrious Scot, <persName>James Watt</persName>. 
                            The final poem of the anthology, <ref type="works" target="on_the_rainbow_apparatus.php">&#x201C;On the Rainbow: In Blank Verse&#x201D;</ref>, seems to seal the collection 
                                with the &#x201C;apocalyptic interpretation of history&#x201D; that, as Colley remarks, represented Britain as Israel &#x201C;and its opponents as Satan&#x02BC;s accomplices,&#x201D; 
                                a conviction that remained engraved in British minds, unfaded by rationalism, and that characterized the thinking of &#x201C;many devout Protestants,&#x201D; Dissenter and Anglican alike 
                                (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BRITONS">Colley, Britons</ref>, pp. 30&#x2013;31).</p>
                            
                            <!-- start here for new --> 
                            <p>In his next anthology, <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poetrydescriptive.php">Poetry Descriptive</ref> (1827), Ruskin complements Britishness and domesticity with landscapes 
                                that gravitate to accessible hills; the collection's most famous poem, is georgic in its depiction and its bestsadvances to North Britain without demonizing the Other, substituting a trope 
                            of moving from history to nature </p>
                            <!-- end here for new -->
                           
                           <p>Darwin's presence, along with that of Maria Edgeworth, whose "Early Lessons" Ruskin imitates in the main portion of MS I, signals that the thought helping frame 
                            these components of identity was the rationalistic and entrepreneurial spirit of the Enlightenment educationalists and the Lunar Society. Indeed, Ruskin may have first encountered 
                            Darwin's poetry in Edgeworth's Frank, which--unlike Rosamond, meant for girls of the same age as Frank--liberally quotes The Botanical Whatever and even unpacks the lines 
                            in detail for a six-year-old's understanding (195-??; Jeremiah Joyce also quotes Darwin et al.). Trained as he was by these models in "the habit of thinking for yourself" so that, 
                            like his avatar Harry, he will "have good sense” (10:97), the forging of identity in this only child of a Scots-English early Victorian household cannot have been very violent. 
                            At the same time, Scotland represented not only Enlightenment but also, as chance fell in the Ruskin family, disease and loss, 
                            as suggested by a possible hidden elegy in <ref type="works" target="on_scotland_apparatus.php">&#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;</ref>. Certainly, 
                            absence was an inescapable feature of the household, as expressed in <ref type="works" target="on_papas_leaving_home_apparatus.php">&#x201C;On Papa&#x02BC;s Leaving Home&#x201D;</ref>, 
                            and the source for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> poem may be the teaching by "experience" that even Edgeworth admits sometimes lies outside of rational and proven experience (pp. ??).

                                or as a presentation copy in itself. Thus, Ruskin&#x02BC;s epistolary presentations
                            are related to these small anthologies, whether as
                            forming mini-anthologies in themselves, or as single-poem presentations
                            in transit, as it were, to its place in an anthology.</p></div>

                        <p>Of the two anthologies, MS I&#x02BC;s is the more miscellaneous in its poems&#x02BC; topics, which range from admiration for Enlightenment scientific and entrepreneurial enterprise; to the
                    the boy&#x02BC;s feelings about his home and his traveling father; to the
                    love of natural phenomena, whether with and without a moral or
                    allegorical association. (The miscellany may be unified, however, by a program for early education; see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical">MS I Poetry Anthology</ref>.) In the second anthology, Ruskin concentrates on the
                    landscape description that will predominate throughout in his later poetry.</p>

                    determining sequence to describe narrative action and spatial relationships;
                    varying meter and rhyrme to express how visual landscape elements
                    &#x201C;lock&#x201D; into one another; . . . Poems in both anthologies,
                    particularly the first, are bookish; as the titles indicate, Ruskin was
                    practicing genres of topographical verse, moral tales, . . . and his hand
                    reflects attempts to copy printed forms. But even a direct redaction of Erasmus
                    Darwin in ... suggests that Ruskin used imitation to learn formal methods of
                    poetic expression; and while the descriptive poems may prove traceable to a
                    source or precedent, their common underlying topic is the discovery of ways to
                    translate visual phenomena into formal verbal expression.</p>
                <p>It is the discovery of poetic means, the act and process of invention, that makes
                    these poems seem original. Some poems surely originate in actual experience and
                    feeling, such as On Papa's Leaving Home; other works seem most persuasively
                    explained in terms of public emotion of the period, such as patriotism and sense
                    of Britishness, such as The Defiance of War, although the public expression can
                    seem colored by the boy's personal circumstances; still other works may
                    originate in personal feeling more indirectly, such as grief for his cousin,
                    James Richardson, but indirectly by using imitative forms; still other works
                    exhibit public emotions such as patriotism works and the phenomena in . . .

                    draft and/or fair copy; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) a homemade gathering of

                    long after the time of composition assembled (with or without Ruskin&#x02019;s
                    oversight) by a member of Ruskin&#x02019;s circle (e.g., W. G. Collingwood or
                    Alexander Wedderburn) and sent to a professional binder. The category is further
                    complicated by some of these compilations subsequently being disassembled owing
                    to damage. </p>

                    tradition surrounding Collingwood, &#x0201C;Preliminary Note,&#x0201D; since the
                    note represented the first attempt at a descriptive bibliography of the early
                    manuscripts, a project subsequently expanded by Alexander Wedderburn and E. T.
                    Cook for the Library Edition. While a simpler solution would be to displace the
                    &#x0201C;Note&#x0201D; with a new system altogether, the innovation would be
                    confusing after well more than a century&#x02019;s investment of scholarship in
                    the earlier bibliography&#x02019;s classifications, and&#x02014;more
                    important&#x02014;the &#x0201C;Note&#x0201D; is itself a historical document of
                    considerable importance. Arguably, to some degree it represents Ruskin&#x02019;s
                    own ideas about the preservation and classification of these manuscripts,
                    although the extent and nature of his involvement will always remain debatable.
                    Even if he played no part at all, the arrangement of manuscripts by
                    Ruskin&#x02019;s Brantwood circle is just as significant, and the most revealing
                    way to make discoveries about the classifications is to work inside them. </p>
                <p>Thus, the &#x0201C;Note&#x0201D; remains indispensable and survives in one of the
                    main portals to the archive. To name just one as an example, the handmade
                    booklet Battle of Waterloo: A Play in Two Acts, with Other Small Poems and its
                    traditional classifications of the major manuscripts are indispensable, however,
                    it can be supplemented by a tabular manuscript survey. This is undertaken as
                    part of the Overview of Manuscripts. </p>
                <p>Ruskin&#x02019;s earliest extant juvenilia dates from 1826, about age seven,
                    aside from probably earlier childish scrawls, simple drawings and tracings, and
                    practice writing of his name on the fly leaves of books. Most of the early
                    writing 1826&#x02013;31, apart from the letters, is contained in the Red Books
                    (MS I, MS III, MS IIIA, MS IV, Juvenilia MS A, Juvenilia MS B, Juvenilia MS C).
                        <hi rend="italic">Red Books</hi> was Ruskin&#x02019;s own term, used from
                    boyhood, when referring to them in letters to his father, and in later years. </p>
                <p>In 1829, Ruskin also began to refer to his <hi rend="italic">works</hi> (<hi
                        rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi>, 187), a term that probably
                    comprised not only the Red Books but also handmade pamphlets like MS II, which
                    bears the heading &#x0201C;Vol I&#x0201D;&#x02014;possibly connected with an
                    arrangement of &#x0201C;works.&#x0201D; Besides MS II, these handmade pamphlets
                    include &#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">Battle of Waterloo / A Play / In Two Act's /
                        With Other Small / Poems / Dedicated to his Father / By John Ruskin / 1829 /
                        Hernhill / Dulwich</hi>&#x0201D; (now tipped into MS V) and possibly MS IB,
                    which appears to have been professionally bound at a later time. Ruskin
                    constructed these (or they were constructed for him) from plain paper cut to
                    about the size of the Red Books, folded once and sewed. &#x0201C;<hi rend="caps"
                        >Battle of Waterloo</hi>&#x0201D; is covered with pink or violet paper,
                    perhaps to make its color uniform with the Red Books. </p>
                <p>Ruskin&#x02019;s compilation of these early &#x0201C;works&#x0201D; can be
                    described as bookmaking as much as writing. From the start in MS I, although his
                    pencil printing is still fairly crude, Ruskin thinks to
                    &#x0201C;justify&#x0201D; the margins, enclose his illustrations in frames and
                    number them as &#x0201C;plates,&#x0201D; and provide a title page and even a
                    colophon. In contents, the Red Books imitate a range of genres, from
                    children&#x02019;s verse and didactic tales, to imitations of the
                    Edgeworths&#x02019; lessons, to more adult forms such as travel narrative and
                    topographical verse. In this imitative bookmaking, Ruskin was probably not
                    unusual among Victorian and Edwardian children. Less famous childhoods also left
                    behind scientific &#x0201C;monographs,&#x0201D; derivative
                    &#x0201C;histories,&#x0201D; and diaries that include illustrated poetry. Some
                    families even privately circulated &#x0201C;magazines,&#x0201D; with elaborate
                    nursery pretenses to real-life editorship.<note

                    Edgeworth, which contains stories within stories ostensibly written by child
                    characters. (See, e.g., &#x0201C;Rivuletta, A Dream&#x0201D; by a girl of
                    thirteen, and &#x0201C;The Injured Ass&#x0201D; by a boy in eleven, both in

                    Victorian childhood pastime is the ambitious scope he set for himself, and the
                    genius and almost incredible pace and flexibility by which he was able to live
                    up to his ambitions. </p>
                <p>At the same time, the Red Books show how easily he was deflected from their
                    initial purposes. MS I, MS III, MS IIIA, and MS IV all begin with title pages
                    announcing works that Ruskin evidently meant to fill the notebook, but those
                    works steadily took up less and less of the available space. In 1826, on the
                    title page of MS I, he announced the first volume of his prose narrative,
                    &#x0201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x0201D; and he filled out the notebook with a brief
                    collection of poems, the MS I Poetry Anthology, which he followed with a
                    colophon to round out the whole. In 1827, he began MS III in the same manner,
                    with a title page for the second volume of &#x0201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x0201D; and
                    he probably nearly simultaneously entered the anthology, Poetry Descriptive, to
                    complement MS I. However, MS III grew more miscellaneous, with the addition of
                    the MS III Second Poetry Anthology, the narrative poem &#x0201C;The
                    Monastery,&#x0201D; and&#x02014;in 1829, in deference to his mother&#x02019;s
                    criticism that he was prone to &#x0201C;beginning too eagerly and becoming
                    careless towards the end of his works as he calls them&#x0201D; (<hi

                    Poetry Anthology. Prior to this crisis, he started MS IV in 1828 with the title
                    page for a &#x0201C;poem on the universe, &#x0201C;Eudosia,&#x0201D; but a large
                    portion of that Red Book was to remain blank, until Ruskin&#x02019;s father used
                    the pages two decades later to compile the first bibliography of the published
                    poetry. MS IIIA. . . .</p>

                    Ruskin family&#x02019;s actual travels and experiences. In his first two volumes
                    of &#x0201C;Harry and Lucy&#x0201D; (MSS I, III [1826&#x02013;28]), Ruskin
                    probably identified with either or both characters Harry and Lucy, although in
                    the portions set at his aunt&#x02019;s home in Perth, Scotland, he may have
                    associated &#x0201C;Lucy&#x0201D; with his cousins Jessie and Mary Richardson.
                    In the third volume (MS IIIA, 1828), Ruskin concentrates less on travel
                    adventures and more on the family&#x02019;s domestic activities at Herne Hill.
                    Having written this volume after his cousin Mary Richardson had come to live
                    with the family, Ruskin appears to identify more exclusively with Harry, who
                    takes a decidedly preceptorial role over Lucy, identified with Mary. Less
                    impulsive than in the two first volumes, and even priggishly strict with Lucy,
                    Harry determines the daily round as teaching Lucy the constellations before
                    breakfast, lessons after breakfast, drawing maps until dinner, correcting Virgil
                    &#x0201C;for his papa&#x0201D; and more mapmaking in the afternoon, and
                    listening to papa read <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> until bed (no.
                    32).</p>
                <p>Seen whole, the earlier juvenilia reveals how extensively the Ruskins invested in
                    the Edgeworths&#x02019; program. Ruskin&#x02019;s first extant poem and slightly
                    later works (nos. 1, ??) are drawn from <hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi>
                    (1792&#x02013;96), by Anna Laetitia Barbauld and her brother Dr. John Aiken.
                    Mrs. Barbauld&#x02019;s hymns and narratives were recommended by Richard
                    Edgeworth as a child&#x02019;s first books, because the pleasurable tales
                    animate children with the desire to learn to read for themselves. Another
                    Edgeworth recommendation, Thomas Day&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Sandford and
                        Merton</hi> (1783&#x02013;89) is declared Harry&#x02019;s &#x0201C;favourite
                    history&#x0201D; in one of Ruskin&#x02019;s narratives (no. 20). Day was a close
                    friend and associate of the Edgeworths, although a more theoretical and
                    committed Rousseauist than they believed prudent.</p>
                <p>In another of Ruskin&#x02019;s very first poems (no. 5), he imitates Erasmus
                    Darwin, the poet of the Lunar Society. This was the circle of scientists,
                    inventors, and industrialists, who stimulated the Edgeworths&#x02019;
                    intellectual life.See Butler, Maria Edgewoth, 33&#x02013;35, 58&#x02013;61; and
                    Robert E. Schofield, The Lunar Society of Birmingham: A Social History of
                    Provincial Science and Industry in Eighteenth-Century England (Oxford:
                    Clarendon, 1963), 204&#x02013;10. Darwin&#x02019;s heroic couplets in <hi
                        rend="italic">The Botanic Garden</hi> (1789&#x02013;91) may also lie behind
                    Ruskin&#x02019;s catalog of plants in his &#x0201C;Eudosia, or a Poem on the
                    Universe&#x0201D; (no. 27), but the title is taken from a production by Capell
                    Lofft (1781), another poet of the scientific enlightenment. Ruskin&#x02019;s
                    introduction to these poets probably came through their frequent quotation in
                    Jeremiah Joyce&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi>, a
                    systematic course in mechanics, astronomy, hydrostatics, pneumatics, optics, and
                    electricity. Joyce&#x02019;s prose is ornamented with extracts from this learned
                    verse, just as Darwin&#x02019;s poem is annotated with extensive scientific
                    notes. Ruskin adopts this elegant manner, after his fashion, in his
                    &#x0201C;Harry and Lucy.&#x0201D; After imitating Joyce&#x02019;s
                    experiments&#x02014;indeed, often copying them verbatim&#x02014;he caps the
                    prose with poems on natural history and the industrial sublime (MS I).</p>
                <p>Ruskin also imitates the conversational mode favored by the Edgeworths and by
                    Jeremiah Joyce, who, on his title page, attributes his
                    &#x0201C;dialogue&#x0201D; manner to the Edgeworths&#x02019; recommendations in
                        <hi rend="italic">Practical Education</hi> (1798&#x02013;1801). Dialogue
                    promotes the fundamental premise of the Edgeworth system, that appeals should be
                    made to children&#x02019;s reason, and that they should be encouraged to think
                    for themselves. Ruskin&#x02019;s Harry and Lucy, much like Edgeworth&#x02019;s
                    Frank and the much beleaguered Rosamond, are quizzed by Mamma, who treats
                    ordinary events as opportunities to admonish self-discipline or to practice
                    multiplication tables. Papa, in both Ruskin and Edgeworth, is less prone to
                    these Pumblechookian methods, and is reserved for more exciting and brilliant
                    experiments and excursions.</p>
                <p>If the boy was following approved Enlightenment models, the elder Ruskin was
                    nonetheless correct in <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi> to detect gestures
                    characteristically his own, when, for example, at the close of his first
                    &#x0201C;Harry and Lucy&#x0201D; (no. 3) he combines an electrical experiment
                    from Joyce, not just with elegant scientific verse, but with a haunting image
                    from Lord Byron. In part, the romance in Ruskin&#x02019;s early writing shows
                    merely that he possessed the materials to temper the Edgeworth&#x02019;s
                    hostility to &#x0201C;inflaming the imagination, or exciting a restless spirit
                    of adventure, by exhibiting false views of life, and creating hopes which, in
                    the ordinary course of things, cannot be realized&#x0201D; (preface to <hi
                        rend="italic">Parent&#x02019;s Assistant</hi>). It is better for Rosamond to
                    tour a cotton factory, even though she is too young to understand the machinery,
                    than to dream over imaginary things (Edgeworth, <hi rend="italic">Rosamond</hi>,
                    part 3, 149). That Ruskin was untroubled by the fancy and fact dichotomy does
                    not seem surprising in a family that regularly read Scott and Byron. The more
                    important division indicated by Ruskin&#x02019;s departures from Edgeworthian
                    discipline is a temperamental one between him and his mother.</p>
                <p> As Michael Brooks has remarked, the Edgeworths&#x02019; educational program may
                    have been more congenial temperamentally to Margaret Ruskin than to her son.

                    Stresses, ed. Anthony S. Wohl (New York: St. Martin&#x02019;s, 1978), 92. The
                    Edgeworths provided a system, and method must have appealed to a woman, whose
                    nearly first words in Ruskin&#x02019;s portrayal of her are to &#x0201C;do one
                    thing at once&#x0201D; (no. 3).</p>
                <p>Although rationalist mentors may have posed fundamental challenges to Margaret
                    Ruskin&#x02019;s evangelicalism&#x02014;just as Enlightenment and Rousseauist
                    approaches to education provoked Mrs. Sherwood, Ruskin&#x02019;s favorite
                    evangelical children&#x02019;s writer&#x02014;the Edgeworths were pragmatic
                    enough that Margaret, like Mrs. Sherwood, was able to take what she wanted from
                    their stories, while disputing the Rousseauist premises. What she wanted was
                    system, reflected, as Brooks points out, in Margaret&#x02019;s constant and
                    painstaking commitment to her child&#x02019;s education and her emphasis on
                    children learning to reflect on his own thought processes. These progressive
                    aims, however, could be detached from Rousseau&#x02019;s fundamental conviction
                    that the natural child should be granted his birthright of freedom. Instead, the
                    Edgeworthian system of children thinking <emph rend="italic">for</emph>
                    themselves could be urged toward thinking <emph rend="italic">about</emph>
                    themselves&#x02014;Protestant self-reflection. In that way, the sinful, natural
                    child would be curbed and made obedient to Christian, parental authority.<note

                        that Mrs. Sherwood, in Ruskin&#x02019;s favorite of the novels, <hi
                            rend="italic">Henry Milner</hi>, avoids pressing even the Protestant
                        tradition of self-examination on her young audience, in favor of enforcing
                        the child&#x02019;s trust and obedience&#x02014;a recourse that survives
                        partly in the strategies of deferring pain and conflict in <hi rend="italic"
                            >Praeterita</hi>, in favor of parental tribute. Now, I would confirm my
                        point about Ruskin&#x02019;s childhood (and adulthood) evasion of emotional
                        distress, which the full spectacle of the early writing proves in even more
                        interesting ways psychologically; however, I would refine that point to add
                        that Ruskin was very early, and very precociously interested in the
                        processes of his own mind&#x02014;if, by that, one refers to what Sheila
                        Emerson has called &#x0201C;the laws of motion&#x0201D; that Ruskin believed
                        reflected both in his own mind on paper and in the outward nature he beheld.
                        Margaret Ruskin, for her part, was probably more prone than Mrs. Sherwood to
                        enforce on children, alongside obedience, the Protestant duty of
                        self-examination; it was in such terms that she probably understood the
                        progressive Edgeworthian recommendation that children reason their way to
                        conclusions, rather than merely accept them. When she read to the
                        ten-year-old Ruskin and his cousin Mary from Adam Smith, that they may
                        &#x0201C;observe something of the working of their own minds,&#x0201D; her
                        ultimate aim was that they gain &#x0201C;more knowledge [of]
                        themselves&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">RFL</hi> 186).</note></p>
                <p>What at times appears characteristic of Ruskin&#x02019;s response to these
                    instructors, whether Edgeworthian or evangelical, are his wily dodges.
                    Joyce&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Dialogues</hi> are carefully arranged for the
                    methodical acquisition of concepts, but Ruskin, in no. 3, begins in the middle
                    of Joyce&#x02019;s course, with pneumatics, and then works backwards even within
                    that series of experiments. . . .</p>
                <p>Ruskin&#x02019;s obedience or resistence to specific forms of training were
                    probably complex. When Ruskin declares in <hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi> that he &#x0201C;went on to amuse myself,
                    in my own way, learnt whole words at a time, as I did patterns&#x0201D; (28:274;
                    35:23), he may be remembering the stress on acquisition of vocabulary in
                    Joyce&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Dialogues</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">Harry
                        and Lucy</hi>, both of which contain long glossaries and insist on a
                    systematic accumulation of terms. Ruskin&#x02019;s memory of solitary learning
                    seems to counter the Edgeworthians&#x02019; contention that vocabulary, like all
                    subjects, &#x0201C;should be made a subject of conversation&#x0201D;; however,
                    Edgeworth also respected the child&#x02019;s pleasure as the best arbiter of
                    what and how much should be read, and above all trained the child&#x02019;s
                    &#x0201C;habit of thinking for yourself&#x0201D; (Edgeworth, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Frank</hi>, 80, 104)....</p>
                <p>Questions of how Edgeworthian or any other system of education was adopted by the
                    elder Ruskins and how it was received cannot be considered apart from the
                    family&#x02019;s psychology....</p>
                <p>The &#x0201C;Harry and Lucy&#x0201D; books bear comparison with that other
                    celebrated body of Victorian juvenilia, the Brontë children&#x02019;s handmade
                    books, in that both simulate in miniature the appearance of printed works. In
                    content also, Ruskin&#x02019;s &#x0201C;Harry and Lucy&#x0201D; narratives are
                    comparable to the Brontë &#x0201C;sagas,&#x0201D; in that the authors project
                    themselves as semireal, semifictional characters into fictive worlds modeled on
                    their reading. The Brontë children interact as &#x0201C;little queens&#x0201D;
                    and &#x0201C;little king&#x0201D; with characters derived from <hi rend="italic"
                        >Blackwood&#x02019;s</hi> and other fiction and with current historical
                    heroes such as the Duke of Wellington. Christine Alexander, <hi rend="italic"

                    1983), 11&#x02013;26, 46. Similarly, Ruskin enters imaginatively into the
                    educational activities of Maria and Richard Edgeworth&#x02019;s Harry and
                    Lucy.</p>
                <p>Unlike the Brontë sagas, Ruskin&#x02019;s juvenilia did not continue to develop a
                    complex, ongoing fictive world. Charlotte Brontë lingered so long in her
                    childhood&#x02019;s imaginative world that her first efforts at mature fiction
                    suffered from embroilment in the earlier sagas. Ibid., 203&#x02013;12. Ruskin,
                    on the other hand, began his &#x0201C;mature&#x0201D; work in childhood. While
                    the earlier &#x0201C;Harry and Lucy&#x0201D; books show charming (and
                    extraordinarily talented) imitations of children&#x02019;s stories and verse,
                    within a few years the juvenilia so elaborately copies an adult library that the
                    pieces appear more to be a child&#x02019;s offering in miniature of adult
                    productions beyond his years. In reading the Brontë sagas, one feels oneself
                    trespassing deeper and deeper into an arcane wonderland wrought by the authors
                    for their private adventuring&#x02014;an effect that would be heightened, I
                    assume, by the privilege of poring over Charlotte&#x02019;s microscopic
                    handwriting and preciously tiny booklets. Ruskin&#x02019;s hand and booklets,
                    too, are small enough to make reading uncomfortable at times, but they do not
                    begin to approach Charlotte&#x02019;s feats. In reading the early Ruskin,
                    rather, one is invited to survey a public spectacle&#x02014;from his paired
                    epics &#x0201C;Iteriad&#x0201D; and &#x0201C;Athens&#x0201D; to his
                    &#x0201C;Poem on the Universe&#x0201D; called
                    &#x0201C;Eudosia&#x0201D;&#x02014;and to admire the mere child who is showing
                    off to his parents &#x0201C;how well he could do it&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic"
                        >Works</hi>, 35:72). At the same time, the more one studies the early Ruskin
                    especially of the rough-draft notebooks (MSS VI, VIII), the more one is struck
                    by how, behind the public performances and spilling into them, Ruskin reveals
                    secrets, fantasies, and emotional turmoil. Ruskin encoded these secrets in
                    various ways, perhaps concealing turmoil even from himself, but the emotions
                    nonetheless continue to trouble his characteristically ebullient voice.</p>
                <p>&#x0201C;Harry and Lucy&#x0201D; books are filled out with short poems. In MS I,
                    the verses are based partly on what he found in children&#x02019;s books,
                    although some of these poems, such as the previously unpublished &#x0201C;On
                    Papa&#x02019;s Leaving Home&#x0201D; (no. 8), already display a highly inventive
                    and interesting emotional response to his father&#x02019;s departures on
                    business trips; other poems, such as &#x0201C;On Scotland&#x0201D; (no. 6) may
                    already show Ruskin responding to family deaths. Loss, whether by death or
                    absence, is a prominent theme in the suppressed fragments; both &#x0201C;The
                    Monastery&#x0201D; (no. 46) and &#x0201C;Athens&#x0201D; (no. 135) break off
                    with the despondent farewells or the absences of older males.</p>
                <p>By 1827, in MS III, Ruskin is imitating adult polite verse in a section named
                    &#x0201C;poetry discriptive&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>), although,
                    again, these poems already reveal an individualistic acuity in perception of
                    visual relationships, as Emerson has remarked. Another verse grouping, also in
                    MS III but dating from 1829, includes the versification of the opening of
                    Scott&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">The Monastery</hi>, Ruskin&#x02019;s project
                    for &#x0201C;a novel&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">RFL</hi>, 185). Also from 1829,
                    the handmade booklet &#x0201C;Battle of Waterloo . . . with Other Small
                    Poems&#x0201D; imitates the verse drama publications of the period. At about the
                    same time, beginning in 1828, Ruskin exhibits a fine Augustan confidence in
                    surveying the creation by devoting a Red Book (MS IV) to &#x0201C;Eudosia; or, a
                    Poem on the Universe.&#x0201D;</p>
                <p>Of the remainder of the earlier juvenilia, one Red Book was used in 1827 for
                    Ruskin&#x02019;s first Latin exercises, prior to Andrews&#x02019;s instruction
                    (MS IVA). Another Red Book (MS IVB) was begun as a personalized guidebook and
                    itinerary for the family&#x02019;s English tour of 1828. Additionally, besides
                    all these notebook productions, Ruskin celebrated his father&#x02019;s
                    birthdays, New Year&#x02019;s, and sometimes his own birthday, by presenting
                    John James with fancy copies of odes composed to commemorate the occasions,
                    along with other kinds of poems. For these he used the most elaborate print or
                    script that he could muster at the time&#x02014;either his most careful early
                    print in imitation of typeface or a &#x0201C;double&#x0201D; print that, as a
                    &#x0201C;Harry and Lucy&#x0201D; episode records, cost him so much time that he
                    rarely again attempted it. Later, he employed a more rapid
                    &#x0201C;copperplate&#x0201D; hand, sometimes decorated with flourishes drawn an
                    arithmetic and orthography primer (see <hi rend="italic">RFL</hi>, 259, 261 n.
                    17). The presentation poems were copied on sheets folded vertically as a folio;
                    then the folios were sometimes folded twice horizontally, like a letter, and a
                    superscription added to the outside&#x02014;typically, &#x0201C;To My
                    Father&#x0201D; and a date. Many of these were bound later by Wedderburn in MSS
                    IA and XI along with other miscellaneous poems and letters.</p>
                <p>&#x0201C;Eudosia&#x0201D; eventually faltered in 1830, with only one volume on
                    &#x0201C;Botany&#x0201D; (containing book 1 and part of book 2) carried from
                    flowers through a catalog of trees. From here, Ruskin went on undaunted to
                    &#x0201C;Iteriad&#x0201D; (MS VII), a four-book verse account of the family tour
                    to the Lakes in 1830, on which he worked until 1832. When, in 1831, he had
                    finished drafting (but not fair-copying) &#x0201C;Iteriad,&#x0201D; he began
                    &#x0201C;Athens,&#x0201D; a verse narrative of Xerxes&#x02019; great march
                    climaxing the Persian Wars. Since Ruskin was translating the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Iliad</hi> at the time, he no doubt was inspired to attempt the ultimate
                    epic achievement: to pair an epic on travel adventure&#x02014;his own <hi
                        rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> in &#x0201C;Iteriad,&#x0201D; as it
                    were&#x02014;with an epic on battle, his <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> in
                    &#x0201C;Athens.&#x0201D; Unlike &#x0201C;Iteriad,&#x0201D; however,
                    &#x0201C;Athens&#x0201D; was never finished, in its draft or its fair copy.
                    Meanwhile, between 1829 and 1832, Ruskin was using a smaller notebook (MS V, not
                    a Red Book) entitled &#x0201C;Miscellaneous Poetry&#x0201D; to gather together
                    fair copies of the shorter poems&#x02014;a sort of collected minor poems.</p>
                <p>A change is noticeable from about 1831, age twelve, when Ruskin was engaged in
                    fair-copying &#x0201C;Iteriad&#x0201D; and in drafting &#x0201C;Athens,&#x0201D;
                    and when his home studies were extended to include modern languages,
                    mathematics, more advanced Latin and Greek, and drawing tutelage.See Tim Hilton,
                        <hi rend="italic">John Ruskin: The Early Years, 1819&#x02013;1859</hi> (New
                    Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1985), 22&#x02013;24. Now the Red Books
                    were set aside for grander notebooks in half-calf or half-roan and marbled
                    boards. As he would boast in early 1833, he required &#x0201C;additional
                    space&#x0201D; for &#x0201C;greater freedom &#38; play of cogitation&#x0201D;
                        (<hi rend="italic">RFL</hi>, 274). In MS VII, he fair-copied his
                    &#x0201C;Iteriad&#x0201D; between 1831 and 1832 and started fair-copying
                    &#x0201C;Athens.&#x0201D; During the same period, 1831&#x02013;32, he kept his
                    first separate sketchbooks, earlier drawings appearing mainly as
                    &#x0201C;plates&#x0201D; in the Red Books. The two sketchbooks exhibit
                    picturesque sketches taken during tours of the southeast of England. Later, in
                    1833&#x02013;34, the remarkable Account of a Tour on the Continent (MS IX)
                    imitates with astonishing fidelity the engraved plates and letterpress of Samuel
                    Rogers&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> and of the professional gift
                    annuals to which Ruskin would soon be contributing verse.</p>
                <p>Besides the epics and poetic travelogues of this period, Ruskin&#x02019;s lessons
                    are worked up as his own &#x0201C;published&#x0201D; textbooks. In place of the
                    1827 Latin vocabulary lists in a Red Book, his 1832 translation of the first few
                    books of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> is presented in an elegant
                    double-column pamphlet. A &#x0201C;Practical Geometry&#x0201D; belonging to
                        &#x0201C;Mast<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ruskin Jan<hi rend="superscript"
                        >y</hi> 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1833&#x0201D;&#x02014;so inscribed
                    probably when it was started (MS XIA) and elaborately handlettered in Gothic and
                    copperplate scripts&#x02014;devotes each page to an elegant statement of a
                    &#x0201C;problem&#x0201D; and its solution in a neatly ruled geometric
                    figure.</p>
                <p>Whether owing to the accident of preservation or to Ruskin&#x02019;s now
                    regarding himself as a more workmanlike poet, there survive from this time two
                    notebooks that serve for rough-drafting poetry before it was copied elsewhere
                    (MSS VI, VIII). MS VIII, kept in continuous use between 1831 and 1836 or 1837,
                    is the primary source for poetry, stories, and drama related to Ruskin&#x02019;s
                    tormented and unrequited first love affair, Adèle Domecq. Also starting about
                    this time, the earlier Red Books are recycled as workbooks (perhaps at the
                    behest of John James, who was economical with paper).<note
                        xml:id="overview_majorms_note004" n="4" resp="#DH" place="botwin">See <hi
                            rend="italic">TLC</hi>, 19. Some of the features of the juvenilia
                        manuscripts, such as the slightest indications of paragraph breaks and the
                        haphazard word divisions in the Sermon Books, may be partly explained by
                        John James&#x02019;s frugality with paper.</note> Turned upside down and
                    started anew from the end opposite to the earlier &#x0201C;Harry and
                    Lucy&#x0201D; narratives, their remaining blank leaves and endboards exploited,
                    or their newer entries even crossing the earlier material, the Red Books were
                    now made to serve diverse interests&#x02014;articles on mineralogy, algebra and
                    geometry exercises, and sketches that turn up in finished form as
                    &#x0201C;plates&#x0201D; in MS IX. The mineralogy notes and catalogs, which
                    begin about 1830&#x02013;31 with a Red Book devoted to the subject (MS IVC),
                    evolve into the ambitious Mineralogical Dictionary (MS IVD [1831&#x02013;36]),
                    Ruskin&#x02019;s own redaction of primers on geological identification and
                    classification, such as Jameson&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">System of
                        Mineralogy</hi> or the geological articles in Loudon&#x02019;s <hi
                        rend="italic">Magazine of Natural History</hi>, to which Ruskin himself
                    would contribute brief scientific papers in 1834.</p>
                <p>By their appearance, the Sermon Books (MSS IIA&#x02013;E) seem positioned between
                    the earlier juvenile Red Books and the later aspirations of the young scholar.
                    By their date also, the sermons&#x02019; composition belong to a transitional
                    period, 1832&#x02013;34. In some physical respects, the Sermon Books are similar
                    to the earlier pamphlets constructed to conform with the Red Books. Handmade and
                    miniature, the pamphlets measure only 9.5 by 15.5 centimeters, with a text space
                    of only 7.5 by 15 centimeters, into which Ruskin packed roughly fifty lines and
                    even seventy-five on some pages. By this time, however, the Red Books themselves
                    were in their recycled stage of use, and in fact some of the Red Books were
                    reused to draft the sermons. Moreover, the Sermon Books, despite their precious
                    dimensions, appear more sober than the &#x0201C;Harry and Lucy&#x0201D; books,
                    linking them to the formal textbook presentations of contemporaneous and later
                    prose&#x02014;the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> translation, the Mineralogical
                    Dictionary, and, later, the first critical essays (MSS XB, no. 270; MS XIB). The
                    ink script is studiously neat longhand, rather than the printing meant to
                    imitate typeface that had been used for poetry before the
                    &#x0201C;Iteriad.&#x0201D; Title headings follow a consistent pattern and,
                    appropriate to the solemn contents, show minimal ornamentation. The margins are
                    &#x0201C;justified&#x0201D; so rigorously that, rather than spoil the effect,
                    words are divided according to how much fits on the line rather than by
                    syllable; hyphens are omitted if space disallows; curlicues, commas, and dots
                    are <emph rend="italic">added</emph> to bring a short line to the margin (easily
                    misread as punctuation by the unwary); and paragraphs are indicated with only
                    the barest indentation or with only a slight line space.</p>
                <p> In content as well, the Sermon Books are especially interesting as reflecting
                    both a self-conscious childishness and a rapidly maturing thought and learning.
                    Although the persona most frequently impersonates an elder, learned divine
                    expositing scripture to his congregation, the writer also speaks as a pious
                    child when the occasion demands, such as when commenting on the Fifth
                    Commandment. The boy&#x02019;s perspective on the doctrine of his church is
                    invaluable, especially as a source for understanding the foundations of
                    Ruskin&#x02019;s mature religious thought.</p> -->
