                <head>MS III Drawings</head>
                <p>Hand: pencil. In order of their appearance in MS III, front to back, the drawings
                    contained in this Red Book are as follows:</p>
                <p>
                    <list type="simple">
                        <item>&#x201C;Harry Going across the Sea in a Steamboat,&#x201D;
                            [&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 2] (1r);</item>
                        <item>Charles&#x02BC;s Wain, [&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D;
                            Vol. 2] (p. 8);</item>
                        <item>&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x02BC;s Friend&#x02BC;s
                            House,&#x201D; [&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 2]
                            (p. 8);</item>
                        <item>&#x201C;Picture of the Bristol Channel,&#x201D;
                            [&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 2] (p. 15);</item>
                        <item>Ship and House, [Miscellaneous Drawing, MS III] (p. <!--Entry needed here.-->?);</item>
                        <item>&#x201C;Ragland Castle When Newly Built,&#x201D;
                            [Miscellaneous Drawing, MS III] (p. 34);</item>
                        <item><!--Entry needed here.-->???, [Miscellaneous Drawing, MS III] (p. 37);</item>
                        <item><!--Entry needed here.-->???, [Miscellaneous Drawing, MS III] (p. 43).</item>
                    </list>
                </p>
                <p>The first four drawings, which fall within &#x201C;Harry and
                    Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 2, relate to the narrative more closely than do most of
                    the &#x201C;plates&#x201D; for &#x201C;Harry and
                    Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1. Whereas only one or two of the latter plates connect
                    directly to the surrounding story, most of the MS III drawings for
                    &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 2, pertain at least to the
                    narrative&#x02BC;s general theme of travel. The subject of the drawing of
                    Charles&#x02BC;s Wain, [&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 2]
                    is referenced directly in the narrative. These are the &#x201C;copper
                    plates&#x201D; announced on Ruskin&#x02BC;s title page for
                    &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 2. </p>
                <p>Ruskin left a pencil notation for &#x201C;chap. 6&#x201D; on p. 36, and
                    for &#x201C;chap. 7&#x201D; on p. 42. Although &#x201C;Harry and
                    Lucy&#x201D; ends on p. 21, these possible projected chapter headings
                    suggest that the miscellaneous drawings on pp. <!--Entry needed here.-->?, 34, 37, and 43 may originally
                    have been meant to illustrate the narrative. For example, <!--Entry needed here.-->???, [Miscellaneous
                    Drawing, MS III], which divides the text of &#x201C;Of rocks first and of
                    caverns now I sing&#x201D; (the poem falling on pp. 36 and 38, and the
                    drawing on p. 37), appears more likely linked to the notation &#x201C;chap.
                    6&#x201D; than to the poem. Similarly, Ship and House, [Miscellaneous
                    Drawing, MS III] is wrapped round by &#x201C;Time: Blank
                    Verse,&#x201D; the second poem of the MS III Second Poetry Anthology, which
                    bears no relation to the drawing. In MS I, as well, Ruskin probably drew his
                    plates prior to fair&#x2010;copying and/or composing the text around them. </p>
                <p> &#x201C;Ragland Castle When Newly Built,&#x201D; [Miscellaneous
                    Drawing, MS III] relates more closely to Poetry Descriptive, which contains the
                    poem &#x201C;Ragland Castle,&#x201D; than to &#x201C;Harry and
                    Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 2, but the narrative refers to the Welsh journey that
                    would have included this attraction.</p>
                <p>The drawings exhibit noticeably greater skill than those in MS I.</p>
