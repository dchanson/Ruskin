                <p>A copy with a Brantwood bookplate now at the Beinecke Library, Yale University,
                    New Haven, Conn., may survive from Ruskin boyhood: <hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home; / or the /
                    Juvenile Budget Opened. / consisting of / a Variety of Miscellaneous Pieces /
                    for the / Instruction and Amusement / of / Young Persons / by Dr. Aiken and Mrs.
                    Barbauld / London / Printed and Published by J. F. Dove, / St. John Square.</hi></p>
                <p>The copy contains marginalia in Ruskin&#x02BC;s mature hand, especially the
                    pages containing the twenty&#x2010;first evening, which is connected with mineralogy
                    (Viljoen, Ruskin&#x02BC;s Backgrounds 8). Scrawls on the front endpaper may
                    be Ruskin&#x02BC;s from childhood: one of these scrawls Helen Gill Viljoen
                    read as a &#x201C;J&#x201D;, and she declared this to be Ruskin&#x02BC;s earliest extant
                    signature (where does she say so? not in Backgrounds where she assigns earliest
                    signature to Frank&#x2014;maybe she thought better of it <!--Correction needed here?-->).</p>
                <p>See Anna Laetitia Barbauld, and, in connection with her
                    influence, &#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;: Discusssion.</p>
                <p>Maria Edgeworth, &#x201C;Harry and Lucy Concluded&#x201D;; although owned by Ruskin, may or may
                    not have been his boyhood copy.</p>
                <p>Maria Edgeworth, &#x201C;Harry and Lucy Concluded&#x201D; (Ruskin&#x02BC;s copy)</p>
                <p> A copy owned by Ruskin with a Brantwood bookplate was acquired by Sharp
                    (Viljoen, Ruskin&#x02BC; Backgrounds, 7). Sharp gave his collection to Helen Gill
                    Viljoen, who in turn, in dividing her collection between libraries, gave the
                    Ruskin books in her possession to the Beinecke Library, Yale
                    University, New Haven, Conn., where this copy of &#x201C;Harry and Lucy Concluded&#x201D;
                    remains.</p>
                <p>The copy is a first (1825) edition <!--Entry needed here.-->.</p>
                <p>It is unclear whether this copy is the one that Ruskin used in childhood. The
                    binding is tight and the pages clean, as compared with Ruskin&#x02BC;s
                    boyhood copy of Edgeworth, Frank, which <!--Entry needed here.--> and which contains marginalia in
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s boyhood as well as mature hands. All <!--Correction needed here?--> the marginalia in
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s &#x201C;Harry and Lucy Concluded&#x201D; is in Ruskin&#x02BC;s mature
                    hand; however, a crude geometrical drawing on the back endpaper of volume 4 may
                    date from boyhood <!--Correction needed here?-->.</p>
                <p>Maria Edgeworth, <hi rend="italic">Frank</hi> (Ruskin&#x02BC;s copy)</p>
                <p>A copy owned by Ruskin with a Brantwood bookplate was acquired by Sharp (Viljoen,
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s Backgrounds, 6). Sharp gave his collection to Helen Gill Viljoen, who in
                    turn, in dividing her collection between libraries, gave the Ruskin
                    books in her possession to the Beinecke Library, Yale University, New Haven,
                    Conn., where this copy of <hi rend="italic">Frank</hi> remains.</p>
                <p>The copy is a first (1822) edition in three volumes <!--Entry needed here.-->.</p>
                <p>The volumes, which have had heavy use <!--Entry needed here.-->, contain marginalia in the hand
                    of one of his parents and in Ruskin&#x02BC;s&#x2014;both his boyhood
                    and mature hands. The first volume has an inscription, &#x201C;John
                    Ruskin,&#x201D; on the first flyleaf (recto), which Viljoen identifies as
                    the hand of John James Ruskin; then, on a blank page which follows [i.e., the
                    second flyleaf, recto], [is] Ruskin&#x02BC;s earliest known signature <!--Correction needed here?-->, a
                    pencilled one Ruskin apparently copied, in a most childish scrawl, from the name
                    as written in ink by his Father (ibid.). <!--Entry needed here.-->
                    Whether this is indeed Ruskin earliest extant signature cannot be determined,
                    but the cursive script, which Ruskin did not generally adopt before <!--Entry needed here.-->, is
                    indeed very labored.</p>
                <p>The endpapers (<!--Entry needed here.-->) of volume 1 also contain Frank drawing, untitled no. 1,
                    and Frank drawing, untitled no. 2.</p>
