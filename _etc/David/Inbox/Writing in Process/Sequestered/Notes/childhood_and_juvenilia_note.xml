                <p>W. G. Collingwood believed that Ruskin&#x02BC;s parents 
                    &#x201C;encouraged, . . . [but] seem [not] to have supervised, the
                    production of his juvenile attempts,&#x201D; pointing to the evidence of
                    only rare intervention parental intervention in the texts themselves: 
                    &#x201C;In only two or three instances a word has been crossed out, and an
                    emendation substituted by his father; but in several places his father and
                    mother have inserted dates into the note-books, or endorsed a loose sheet 
                    &#x2018;John&#x02BC;s Poetry,&#x2019; (<hi rend="italic">Date <!--Correction needed here?--></hi>)&#x201D; (<hi
                        rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891], 1:261; <hi
                        rend="italic">Poems</hi> [8<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891], 1:262).
                    Collingwood is correct about the evidence in the major manuscripts, but the
                    family letters suggest a more complex story about parental supervision. Margaret
                    Ruskin did attempt (not always successfully) to control Ruskin&#x02BC;s
                    behavior of imaginative writing&#x2014;for example, the length of time he
                    devoted to poetry, or the completion of goals the boy set for
                    himself&#x2014;but appears to have exercised less control over the
                    writing&#x02019;s content. John James Ruskin occasionally took his
                    wife&#x02BC;s cues in enforcing discipline over behavior, but transparently
                    half-heartedly, and he was more collusive than controlling respecting content.
                    The boy was probably largely self-governing in regulating content. </p>
