                <head type="title">HARRY &#x0026; LUCY &#x007C; POEMS &#x007C; &#x0026;c</head>
                <p>This title is stamped on the spine of a blue morocco slip case containing four
                    Red Books (MS I, MS III, MS IIIA, MS IV) and one handmade paper booklet (MS II).
                    The slip case housed these manuscripts when sold in the July 1930
                    Sotheby&#x02BC;s sale of Ruskin&#x02BC;s manuscripts (Sotheby
                    &#x0026; Co., Catalogue of Manuscripts and Library [1930], lot 112, item I [pp.
                    20&#x2013;21]). In recent years, at the Beinecke Library, the contents have
                    been separated from the slip case, which is preserved separately.</p>
                <p>This grouping of the Red Books is traceable, at least in part, to Ruskin himself,
                    although it is unknown whether he had anything to do with the blue morocco
                    casing. In September 1870, Ruskin docketed MS IV, MS III, and MS I as,
                    respectively, Red Books nos. 1, 2, and 3 (see Red Books). That these three
                    manuscripts became the basis for the group in &#x201C;Harry &#x0026; Lucy,
                    Poems &#x0026; c&#x201D; is indicated by the inclusion of MS IV in the
                    group&#x2014;a manuscript that lacks the relation that obviously associates
                    the other four, the contents of some portion of the &#x201C;Harry and
                    Lucy&#x201D; narrative (in MS I, &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D;
                    Vol. 1; in MS II, draft of &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 3; in
                    MS III, &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 2; in MS
                    IIIA, &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 3).</p>
