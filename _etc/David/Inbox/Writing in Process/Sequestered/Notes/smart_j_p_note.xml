                <head>James P. Smart, Jr. (?-?<!-- Entry needed here -->)</head>
                <p>Compiler of the Wise and Smart, <hi rend="italic">Complete Bibliography of . . .
                        Ruskin</hi>. He also authored an admired pen portrait of Ruskin . . . Smart
                    held an M.A. from Oxford [during JR&#x02BC;s time?<!-- Entry needed here -->]. According to Howatt, &#x201C;Glasgow
                    Ruskin Society&#x2014;No. 1,&#x201D; Smart was managing partner of Messrs John Clark, Jun.,
                    &amp; Co., Mile End [what is this<!-- Entry needed here -->], from which by 1889, the date of
                    Howatt&#x02BC;s article, he had &#x201C;retired a few years ago.&#x201D; Evidently, on retiring from
                    business, he took up university teaching: &#x201C;In our own [Glasgow] University he
                    lectured last year for Professor Edward Caird. For the last two years he has
                    been lecturing on political economy in the University College of Dundee, while
                    for the last four years he has had the lectureship of Queen Margaret&#x02BC;s College
                    in this city&#x201D; (18).</p>
                <p>He also worked as an editor, overseeing &#x201C;The Canterbury Poets&#x201D; series for the
                    London publisher, Walter Scott. He is mentioned also as a choir leader in
                    Howatt, Glasgow Ruskin Society&#x2014;No. 3&#x201D; (89).</p>
                <p>Howatt&#x02BC;s article is meant as an account of the founding of the Glasgow Ruskin
                    Society, but it appears equally meant to salute Smart and features a wood
                    engraving of his portrait. The tone is set by an opening paragraph praising <hi
                        rend="italic">discipleship</hi> and the fittingness of &#x201C;the disciples of
                    John Ruskin . . . band[ing] themselves together for the closer study of the
                    master&#x02BC;s words, that they may the better help on the great work which he and
                    they have so much at heart&#x201D; (17). Smart was a founding member and elected the
                    Society&#x02BC;s first president in 1879 (making Glasgow the second of the Ruskin
                    Societies, Manchester having established the first, in 1878, and London
                    following in 1881, and Liverpool in 1883). He served only for the first session,
                    resigning in May 1880. </p>
                <p> In an 1889 announcement, &#x201C;New Ruskin Bibliography,&#x201D; Smart is mentioned along
                    with George C. Moody . . . nothing about Wise. . . .<!-- Entry needed here. --></p>
                <p> No one has suggested any culpability in James P. Smart, who probably performed
                    most of the serious work on the <hi rend="italic">Bibliography</hi>, and who
                    presumably was duped by Wise into introducing the fakes into currency.</p>
