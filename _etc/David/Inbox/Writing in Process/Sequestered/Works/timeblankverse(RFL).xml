                    <l>Papa whats time a figure or a sense</l>
                    <l>Tis one but not the other.  Is not time</l>
                    <l>a figure   Yes it is for on the tops of shops</l>
                    <l>we often see a figure with two wings</l>
                    <l>a scythe upon one shoulder and a lock</l>
                    <l>of hair upon his forehead while his head is bald</l>
                    <l>except the lock upon his forehead and called time</l>
                    <l>times very quick and therefore he has wings</l>
                    <l>when past times gone for ever so he has a lock</l>
                    <l>of hair upon his forehead and the proverb is</l>
                    <l>take time by his forelock &#x02014; he mows down everything</l>
                    <l>and so he has a scythe. time is so quick</l>
                    <l>that might a year be called a day</l>
                    <l>Day now I think of it tis New-Years-Day</l>
                    <l>a happy New-Years-Day to you Papa</l>
                    <l>and now I must return to time</l>
                    <l>is time only a figure   no he is not</l>
                    <l>what is he then   what is he   I dont know</l>
                    <l>he's not a quality   of that I'm sure</l>
                    <l>oh I remember now   he is a god</l>
                    <l>entitled saturn   he's a heathen god</l>
                    <l>and well he might be called one   none but them</l>
                    <l>could go so quick or jump from 'tween our hands</l>
                    <l>as time does   time I'm quite away from him</l>
                    <l>away from him   no surely I'm not so</l>
                    <l>for I'm at heathen gods and he's a god</l>
                    <l>so though I may be from him I'm not far</l>
                    <l>from him &#x02014; and now I must go to him quite</l>
                    <l>tis but an hour to merry New Years Day &#x02014;</l>
                    <l>for though it is a day a days an hour</l>
                    <l>and whats an hour   tis only a wee minute</l>
                    <l>made so by the quick course of time</l>
                    <l>so Mr time as Ive said all about you</l>
                    <l>All Ive to say I must take leave of you</l>
