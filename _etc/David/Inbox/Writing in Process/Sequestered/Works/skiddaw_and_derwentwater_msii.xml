                        Skiddaw upon thy heights the sun shines br8ight / but only for a moment then gives place / Unto a playful cloud which on thy brow / Sports wantonly then floats away in air /throwing its shadow on thy towering height / And darkens for a moment thy green side / But adds unto its beauty as it makes / the sun more bright when it again appears //p. break// <Now hear my boyish moral> /Then in the morning on thy brow those clouds / Rest as upon a couch and give [vain or fair (?)] <res> scope / For fancys play. And airy fortresses / and towers battlements and all appear. /chasing the other off and in their turn / are chased by the others. But enough / Ive treated of the clouds. now skiddaw come / noble and grand and beutious [sic] clothed with green / and yet but scantily and in some parts / a  bare terrific cliff precip[(?)] / descends with only here & there a [root(?) not bush] / straggling as [. . . (?)] from the cliff [this last line written over top of in brown ink as follows] a straggler. [there as tho(?)] grow with stone for earth / and bare and scraggy as befits the cliff //p. break and end of overwritten line; ms. from now on in ink//
