                    This manuscript followed the MS IA version closely, in RF T70 The location of the original manuscript is unknown, as are the occasion and date of its presentation, and its physical characteristics, other than its likely consisting of a single folded sheet. The photograph indicates a version, apparently fair-copy, which predated the MS III fair copy. 
                    
                    On the last page of the folded sheet (i.e., p. 4) in the photograph, revised lines of “The Constellations” appear to be written over top of a lighter script of lines that cannot be connected definitely with any extant juvenilia: This scrawled draft suggests notes for a sermon. If so, the draft represents the earliest known such text, appearing at least a year earlier than the first definitely known text of this kind (see “A Sermon” [“shut him up”]: Discussion). Another possibility is that the erased text represents an attempted revision of “The Constellations” since some lines were given a more pious cast in the final version (see, e.g., Textual Note for the lines “The scales in which twas vainly said / The crime and virtues of men were weighed,” and for the closing meditation on the superiority of virtue to knowledge). No surviving fair-copy lines, however, even remotely match the faint draft in the photograph.
