                    Sharp. In Collingwood’s time, this 1830 travel diary was included in a  cover  along with some other items  in the possession of Mrs. Arthur Severn  (PJR, 1:267). See Sotheby’s 1930 for other tour-related manuscripts that were given to Joan Severn.
                    As noted by Cook and Wedderburn in their description of MS X (Works, 2:534), the 1830 diary was later bound separately from MS X. This history, remarks Dearden, as well as bad selection and lotting from Brantwood by Sotheby’s, explains how the manuscript became separated from the other diaries (RBB, 49). SEE ALSO BURD’S ACCOUNT IN TLC 4.
                    Eventually, the diary found its way into the hands of Sharp--all except for two leaves, which had been kept apart at the time of binding and donated by Joan Severn to the Coniston Museum. In the manuscript, these two leaves were replaced by a transcript in Collingwood’s hand. (Presently, the museum exhibits copies of these leaves, while the originals are deposited at the Cumbria Record Office, County Offices, Kendal, Cumbria.) The diary especially became a bone of contention between Sharp and J. H. Whitehouse, who had acquired most of the diaries (for this story, see TLC, 4-5; RBB, 182-83; and Van Akin Burd,  Frederick James Sharp, 1880-1957,  Book Collector 44, no. 4 [Winter 1995]: 554-57). Like all the manuscripts in Sharp’s possession, the diary was bequeathed to Helen Gill Viljoen and eventually was donated to the Morgan Library.

                    As explained in  Provenance  above, Wedderburn arranged to have the diary bound after its separation from MS X. The binding is red buckram, like those for manuscripts that formed lot 27 in Sotheby Cat. 1931; lettered in gilt  Ruskin MS.--Tour to the Lakes, 1830 ; 19 × 23 cm. The original two handmade paper books consist, respectively, of 44 pp., watermarked  G. Wilmot / 1830,  and impressed with stationer’s stamp of a crown, 18.5 × 22.5 cm; and of 20 pp., watermarked  I &#x0026; J Dewdney / 1826,  of slightly varying size 20-20.5 × 15.5-16.5 cm. Burd also supplies a description in TLC, 3.
                    The leaves donated to the Coniston Museum are comprised in the outside folded sheet of the second, smaller book. As Burd remarks, since Collingwood’s transcript of these leaves was bound along with the original manuscript, the binding must have been done between August 1901, when the Coniston Museum opened and Joan Severn presumably donated the leaves, and 1903, when the binding is mentioned in the second volume of the Library Edition.
                    See the introduction to TLC for Burd and Dearden’s analysis of the handwritings of John Ruskin and Mary Richardson, who shared in the composition; of the ordering of the contents; and of the circumstances under which the diary was written.
