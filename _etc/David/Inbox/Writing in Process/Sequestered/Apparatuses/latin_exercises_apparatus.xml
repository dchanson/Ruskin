            <p>Perhaps beginning in 1826, and presumably continuous throughout that year and into 1827.</p>
            <p><ref type="note" target="viljoenhg.php">Helen Gill Viljoen</ref> (&#x0201C;Dating MSS of Boyhood,&#x0201D; <ref type="biblio" target="xxx.php">Viljoen Papers</ref>, boxes D.V, E.IX) arrived at 1827 as a probable date for MS IVA on the authority of her colleague, Professor Konrad Gries, who commented:&#x0201C;Since Ruskin was reading the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> in the first half of 1829, when he was ten, I should say that these exercises go back at least two years, and were written shortly after he had begun his study of Latin.&#x0201D;</p>

            <p>The penciled hand in MS IVA is similar to that in <ref type="mss" target="1.php">MS I</ref>, which contains the earliest reference to Latin, Ruskin&#x02019;s Harry having to interrupt his play to attend to lessons (<ref type="works" target="3.php">&#x0201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x0201D; Vol. 1</ref>, chap. 2). The next dateable references to Latin lessons occur in 1828 and 1829, when Ruskin is translating Virgil&#x02019;s fourth pastoral and the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> (<ref type="works" target="xxx.php">&#x0201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x0201D; Vol. 3</ref>; and <ref type="mss" target="xxx.php">MS II</ref>)&#x02014;the former for his father, and the latter for his tutor. The more rudimentary exercises in MS IVA must have been drawn from Adams&#x02019;s Latin grammar, the&#x0201C;Scotch thing&#x0201D; that his later tutor Reverend Dale contemptuously dismissed (<ref type="biblio" target="jrworksle.php">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 35:83).</p>
            <p>Viljoen&#x02019;s colleague, Professor Gries (<ref type="internal" target="#date">see Date</ref>), however, remarked that,&#x0201C;these exercises look like notes on what he had been told, together with attempts to write up his own models and create, so to speak, his own grammar. This is of course a sensible way of learning Latin, or any language. The contents on the other hand indicate the old-fashioned and nonsensical grammar-analysis approach to language.&#x0201D;</p>
