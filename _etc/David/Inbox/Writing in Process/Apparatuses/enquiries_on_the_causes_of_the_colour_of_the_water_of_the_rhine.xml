                    <p>Ruskin's first paper for Loudon's Magazine of Natural History (vol. vii, no. 41 [September 1834], pp. 438-39) was started by March, along with no. 191, when he refers to them in no. 189. In the first issue, Loudon announces the spirit in which Ruskin would have contributed his first published prose works.  Like many of the fancy literary annuals in which Ruskin published some of his early verse, the magazine drew "voluntary contributions" from its readers. "Every reader" was invited "to communicate . . . observations which, at first sight, may appear trivial, [but which] are often truly valuable when viewed in reference to general conclusions . . . [and which] may be furnished by persons wholly unacquainted with natural history as a science."  The magazine also undertook to educate amateurs with introductory papers on various fields of natural history (The Magazine of Natural History, ed. J. C. Loudon [London: Longman et al.], vol. 3 [1830], p. iii; and vol. 1 [1829], pp. 8-9).</p>
                    <p>In a part of Deucalion issued in October 1879,
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> confidently relayed an anecdote that transferred the event of his
                        first appearance in print to his first prose publication, his 1834 papers
                        for Loudon&#x02BC;s Magazine of Natural History (nos. 190&#x2013;91, 193): I well yet
                        remember my father&#x02BC;s rushing up to the drawing&#x2010;room at Herne Hill, with wet
                        and flashing eyes, with the proof in his hand of the first sentences of his
                        son&#x02BC;s writing ever set in type,&#x2014;&#x201C;Inquiries on the Causes of the Colour of
                        the Water of the Rhone&#x201D; . . . . My mother and I eagerly questioning the
                        cause of his excitement,&#x2014;&#x201C;It&#x02BC;s&#x2014;it&#x02BC;s&#x2014;only print!&#x201D; said he. Alas! how much
                        the &#x201C;only&#x201D; meant! (Works, 26:275) <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have been misled by a recent
                        bibliography of his published writings, Shepherd, of which the first edition
                        was published in September 1878, and which lists the &#x201C;Inquiries&#x201D; as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s
                        first periodical publication. In October 1878, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had written to
                        Shepherd of the bibliography, &#x201C;It will be of extreme value to me in filling
                        up what gaps I can in this patched coverlid of my life before it is draped
                        over my coffin&#x2014;if it may be&#x201D; (Works, 34:537). Shepherd, however, must have
                        been misled in his turn by Ruskin, who, in an 1872 edition of the Catalogue
                        of the Rudimentary Series of drawings at the Oxford schools, had remarked
                        &#x201C;that Mr. Loudon was the first literary patron who sent words of mine to be
                        actually set up in print, in his Magazine of Natural History, when I was
                        sixteen&#x201D; (Works, 21:243). The important point, I believe, is that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x2014;in
                        the 1870s and in the context of his writings on drawing, botany, and
                        geology&#x2014;wanted to believe that his first publications were scientific and
                        factual, not poetic, in nature. Since Shepherd and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s published
                        remarks in the 1870s on his first publication would have been taken as
                        authoritative, the succeeding major bibliographies&#x2014;Wise (1:302&#x2013;3, 2:111),
                        and the chronological list of publications appended to Collingwood&#x02BC;s Life
                        (1893, 1:233)&#x2014;likewise awarded the distinction to the 1834 papers for
                        Loudon&#x02BC;s Magazine. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s first poetry publications, according to these
                        bibliographies, were the 1835 contributions to Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering (see
                        nos. 180, 207; Wise, 2:123; Collingwood, Life [1893], 1:233). Wise and his
                        co&#x2010;editor Smart were unlikely to be disabused by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> or the Severns of
                        any errors, the response from Brantwood to Wise being as politely insouciant
                        and unhelpful as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had been to Shepherd (&#x201C;Wise and Ruskin I,&#x201D; 48,
                        51&#x2013;52). Collingwood, for his part, may have relied more on Wise and Smart
                        than they did on him (see &#x201C;Wise and Ruskin I,&#x201D; 46&#x2013;47). Collingwood&#x02BC;s
                        persistence in the error is remarkable, however, since he knew about John
                        James&#x02BC;s entry in MS IV on the Spiritual Times publication and even printed
                        it, without comment, in 1891 (PJR 1:264; Collingwood misprinted the 1830
                        date of publication as &#x201C;1831&#x201D;). This did not prevent Collingwood two years
                        later in the Life (1893) from maintaining that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> &#x201C;began his literary
                        career&#x201D; as the &#x201C;analytic <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName> . . . already an enfant terrible&#x201D;
                        (1:49&#x2013;50). In light of what, by the 1890s, appears to have settled into a
                        prejudice favoring <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s analytic and scientific beginnings,
