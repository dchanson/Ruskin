                    <p>In the bibliography of the Library Edition, section III ("Catalogue of Ruskin MSS."), subsection B ("Diaries and Note-books"), 
                        the editors list under "Note-books" a group of manuscripts that they entitle "Juvenilia" 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 38:206). 
                        They intend the categorical title "Juvenilia" to apply to all the "MSS., containing Poems, Geological Notes, etc., etc.," 
                        comprised by their expanded version of W. G. Collingwood's descriptive bibliography, "Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems"<!-- Link to a note on this "Note" --> 
                        in volume 2 of the Library Edition <!-- Link to a note on Library Edition -->
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 2:529-34).
                        The title "Juvenilia" came to be applied in particular, however, to "three small books" that, in the main bibiography in volume 38, 
                        the editors note as an addendum to "those [MSS.] there described" in Collingwood's "Preliminary Note" reprinted and expanded in volume 2 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 38:206), 
                        these three notebooks being nowhere described. (W. G. Collingwood omitted these three manuscripts from his original 
                        "Preliminary Note" presumably because they contained no poetry by Ruskin.)</p>
                    <p>As a result, the title "Juvenilia" stuck for these three notebooks in particular, as attested 
                        by the embossing of this title on the spine of the blue morocco slipcase containing the three notebooks, a slipcase that was constructed at perhaps the same time that the bibliography volume 
                        of the Library Edition was being compiled 
                        (see below, Location, Provenance). Consequently, the three notebooks came to be listed for sale under the title "Juvenilia" in

                    <p>I have conventionalized a title "MS Juvenilia B" as referring to the second of the three notebooks, identified by the editors as (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) in their list of "Juvenila" 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 38:206). See also

                        <p>Ruskin did not number the pages, and he created no title page for this Red Book or for its opening work; at any rate, no title page has survived. 
                            The inside front endboard, where he placed the title for "Harry and Lucy," Vol. 1, in <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php">MS I</ref>, is blank in MS Juvenilia B,

                     In about 1833, sermon draft and geometry exercises were inserted in pencil--the same time when MSS IIIA, IVA, and IVB were being similarly used for drafting mineralogy and sermons. Viljoen misdated all these items as 1831.
