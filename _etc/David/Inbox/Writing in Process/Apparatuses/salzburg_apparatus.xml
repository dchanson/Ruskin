                    <p>According to Cook and Wedderburn, no manuscript is extant of the final version of this poem as it was published in Friendship's Offering, 
                        although MS VIII contains a considerably different first version, which they reprint in a note. 
                        (The editors, incidentally, refer to the “Friendship’s Offering for 1835" [Works 2:441 n.], but the annual for 1836 must be intended--i.e., 
                        the volume ready by Christmas 1835.) This draft initiates the material in MS VIII related to the Continental tour of 1835 
                        (see app A, MS VIII, “Content,” [e]).  For most of the tour, Ruskin's attention had been directed at geology, which he discussed in his prose diary no. 202, 
                        but the diary notes abruptly end in late September.  He must have turned to poetry during the remaining few months of the tour--the family visiting Salzburg in mid-October--since "Salzburg" was ready to be published at the end of 1835 in a gift annual, which also included excerpts from no. 180.  Presumably, Ruskin was carrying MS VIII with him (though it contains no draft for no. 203), and he and John James were in correspondence with the editor of Friendship's Offering, Thomas Pringle, since the family did not return to Herne Hill until December. Indeed, the draft, “barely legible” as Cook and Wedderburn remark, may reflect the bustle and inconveniences of travel; the inks vary considerably in this section. See no. 209 for further commentary on the difficulty of dating the work of late 1835.
