                <!-- For Calais prose, after "introduction to France, and the French" -->
                <p>Ruskin adopts a picturesque view of Calais, as compared with a practical view, which in some guidebooks dwells on British travellers' difficulties 
                    negotiating the transition to the Continent, such as coping with customs and finding lodging. Compare, for example, 
                    the detailed complaints in <hi rend="italic">Heath's Picturesque Annual for 1832</hi> that, in Calais, 
                    "the communication between the strangers and natives is full of strife and wrangling or silent bitterness" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#HEATHSANNUAL1832">Ritchie, <hi rend="italic">Travelling Sketches in the North of Italy, the Tyrol, and on the Rhine</hi></ref>, 3). 
                    Correspondingly, Ruskin's account turns the abrupt transition from English character to French, separated only by the Channel crossing, into a topic for romance, 
                    whereas Murray's 1836 guidebook remarks "that the place is half Anglicised and our language is generally spoken" 
                    (although this guide also remarks that the English in Brussels, formerly forming "the largest British colony on the Continent," 
                    had been dispersed by the Belgian Revolution of August 1830) 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><hi rend="italic">Hand-book for Travellers on the Continent</hi></ref>, 86, 134).</p>
                    
                <!-- For end of Calais prose, about length of crossing -->
                <p>Steamers from Dover to Calais averaged, according to Murray's 1836 guidebook, two-and-a-half hours  
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><hi rend="italic">Hand-book for Travellers on the Continent</hi></ref>, 86). 
                    From the Tower of London to Calais, the trip lasted twelve hours, according to Murray's as well as to Starke's 1833 guidebook 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#STARKETRAVELSINEUROPE">Starke, <hi rend="italic">Travels in Europe</hi></ref>, 526). See also

                <!-- For Cassel -->
                <p>From Calais, Cassel lay 13 and three-quarters miles or 2 and a half posts, with St. Omer along the way at 11 miles or 2 posts. </p>
                <p>Starting in the 1590s, to evade persecution, some English Catholics sent their children to be educated at an English Jesuit school, 
                    St. Omers College, established at Saint-Omer. The school was closed by the <hi rend="italic">arr&#x00EA;t of the Paris Parlement of 1762</hi> aimed at the expulsion 
                    of Jesuits, and the scholars migrated first to Bruges and then Li&#x00E8;ge. The Li&#x00E8;ge Academy was disrupted by the Napoleonic Wars, and the scholars migrated again in 1794 to 
                Stonyhurst in Lancashire, an estate donated by a former pupil as a permanent home for the school. For the Protestant Ruskins, the former site of the school at Saint-Omer would 
                have borne the melodramatic association of some of its scholars with the Gunpowder Plot--the only fact about the school mentioned by John Murray, in his 1836 guidebook to the Continent.</p>
                    <p>
                    The ancient Abbey of St. Bertin at St. Omer had recently been destroyed by the commune in 1830. . . . 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><hi rend="italic">Hand-book for Travellers on the Continent</hi></ref>, 85, 86-87).
                    Ruskin's depiction of a Roman Catholic religious procession at St. Omer was suggested, Collingwood believes, 
                    by the English Jesuit College--whose graduates could still be notoriously connected with the Gunpowder Plot, in the views of a guidebook of the period 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#POEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>, 1:???;

                <p>Murray's guidebook highlights Cassel as "most agreeably situated on a hill commanding a view much celebrated in France, but which, after all, 
                    will bear no comparison with that from the Malvern Hills in England. It extends over the flat and fertile plains of Flanders, 
                    and as far as the white cliffs of England into 3 kingdoms; includes 32 towns and 100 villages. 
                    Mont Cassel was one of principal bases of the great trigonometrical survey carried on during the reign of Napoleon"

                    Its <hi rend="italic">citadel</hi> is considered a masterpiece of the skill of [the military engineer] Vauban [1633-1707] who was governor of it for many years"

                <p>Ruskin's English indignation over officials' manner of examining the family's passport was shared by Murray's guidebook: 
                    "Since the revolution of 1830, considerable strictness is maintained by the police in demanding the passports of travellers. 
                    They are usually given up at the gates of every large town; and the owner is required to apply for them in person at the police-office, 
                    where they will be returned, properly <hi rend="italic">vis&#x00E9;s</hi>. The under functionaries of the Belgian police offices often display in their conduct 
                    instances of insolence, dilatoriness, and neglect of their duties very annoying to the traveller"
                (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><hi rend="italic">Hand-book for Travellers on the Continent</hi></ref>, 74-75).

               <!-- For Brussels -->
                <!-- on comparisons with Paris as brick kilns --><p>Ruskin's comparison of Brussels with Paris at the expense of the grander city is the opposite view of Murray's guidebook, 
                    which belittles Brussels as "Paris on a small scale" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><hi rend="italic">Hand-book for Travellers on the Continent</hi></ref>, 134).</p>
                
                <p>According to Murray's guidebook, Ruskin has missed the point about the H&#x00F4;tel de Bellevue, which in the Belgian Revolution of August 1830, 
                    "standing between the Place Royale, where the Belgian insurgents were posted, and the Park, was the centre of action, and was actually riddled with shot. 
                    To gratify the curiosity of travellers, the landlord retained some of the cannon-balls <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> as long as the Belgic revolution remained a subject of curiosity"
