<p>January(?) 1826.</p>
<p>In the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="msipoetryanthology">MS I Poetry Anthology</xref>, <xref type="note" doc="note" target="ruskinmargaret">Margaret Ruskin</xref> wrote &ldquo;Jan 1826&rdquo; at the end of &ldquo;The Needless Alarm,&rdquo; the fourth poem in the anthology, and before <xref type="works" doc="works" target="8">&ldquo;On Papa&rsquo;s Leaving Home,&rdquo;</xref> the fifth poem. Immediately below this, she drew a rule, followed by &ldquo;this book begun about Sep<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> or Oct 1826 / finished about Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1827.&rdquo; Since the latter comment clearly refers to the whole of <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="1">MS I</xref>, <xref type="note" doc="note" target="collingwoodwg">W. G. Collingwood</xref> took the preceding date, &ldquo;Jan 1826,&rdquo; as applying to &ldquo;The Needless Alarm&rdquo; in particular and thus as identifying Ruskin&rsquo;s earliest dated verse known to that editor (<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="poems4d1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</xref>, 1:xxii; <xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="poems8d1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [8<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</xref>, 1:viii). If this was Margaret&rsquo;s intention, the date may point to a more elementary stage of reading one year earlier than the scientific readings reflected elsewhere in the contents of <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="1">MS I</xref>&mdash;evidence of a graduated program of reading recommended by educationalists such as the Edgeworths (<xref type="internal" doc="internal" target="DISCUSSION">see Discussion</xref>).</p>
<p>In the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="libraryedition">Library Edition</xref>, <xref type="note" doc="note" target="cooket">E. T. Cook</xref> and <xref type="note" doc="note" target="wedderburn">Alexander Wedderburn</xref> disagreed with Collingwood&rsquo;s interpretation, ascribing the status of earliest dated verse possibly to <xref type="works" doc="works" target="5">&ldquo;When furious up from mines the water pours&rdquo; [&ldquo;The Steam Engine&rdquo;]</xref>, which is &ldquo;poem I&rdquo; in the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="msipoetryanthology">MS I Poetry Anthology</xref>: &ldquo;there is nothing to show that [Margaret&rsquo;s date] does not apply equally to all four pieces, composed presumably in the order in which they are placed in the book.&rdquo; Moreover, along with <xref type="works" doc="works" target="5">&ldquo;When furious up from mines the water pours&rdquo; [&ldquo;The Steam Engine&rdquo;]</xref>, they point to another contender for earliest poem&mdash;<xref type="works" doc="works" target="14">&ldquo;Ragland Castle,&rdquo;</xref> which is the first poem in another anthology, <xref type="note" doc="note" target="poetrydiscriptive">Poetry Descriptive</xref>, in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref>, and which they date &ldquo;as early as these&rdquo; poems in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="1">MS I</xref> (<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="jrworksle">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></xref>, 2:255 n. 1; see <xref type="works" doc="works" target="12#date">&ldquo;Wales&rdquo;: Date</xref>).</p>
<p><xref type="works" doc="works" target="14">&ldquo;Ragland Castle,&rdquo;</xref> however, more likely belongs to the second half of 1827, when the family visited Raglan and other sites in Wales. The earlier date ascribed by Cook and Wedderburn to <xref type="works" doc="works" target="5">&ldquo;When furious up from mines the water pours&rdquo; [&ldquo;The Steam Engine&rdquo;]</xref> turns, moreover, on elaborate reasoning that defies facts. That argument assumes, first, that Margaret&rsquo;s note &ldquo;Jan 1826&rdquo; refers to all four poems preceding the note, not just to &ldquo;The Needless Alarm&rdquo;; second, that the first poem of this group to be fair-copied&mdash;<xref type="works" doc="works" target="5">&ldquo;When furious up from mines the water pours&rdquo; [&ldquo;The Steam Engine&rdquo;]</xref>, or &ldquo;poem I&rdquo;&mdash;must necessarily have been the first composed; and, third, that Margaret&rsquo;s date &ldquo;Jan 1826,&rdquo; according to the editors, &ldquo;seems to be the date of the note, and not of any one of the verses in particular.&rdquo; That is, in this view, &ldquo;Jan 1826&rdquo; applies to the note that follows, &ldquo;this book begun about Sep<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> or Oct 1826 / finished about Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1827.&rdquo; Thus, this argument entails a discrepancy in dates, since the editors hazard that &ldquo;perhaps, writing at the beginning of a new year, Mrs. Ruskin made the common error of not altering the old year&rsquo;s date&rdquo;&mdash;writing, that is, &ldquo;Jan 1826,&rdquo; but intending &ldquo;Jan 1827&rdquo; (<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="jrworksle">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></xref>, 2:255 n. 1).<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works1ffn1">1</xref></hi></p>
<p>Since Cook and Wedderburn&rsquo;s reasoning depends on overruling what Margaret actually wrote, Collingwood&rsquo;s interpretation seems certainly more straightforward and surely at least as convincing&mdash;namely, that the date applies to &ldquo;The Needless Alarm&rdquo; but not necessarily to all four of the poems preceding the note. While &ldquo;The Needless Alarm&rdquo; must have been fair-copied &ldquo;about Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1827&rdquo; along with the other verse at the end of <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="1">MS I</xref>, Margaret would have known if the poem had been composed a year earlier than the others (and if that was the case, she may have remembered the date because &ldquo;The Needless Alarm&rdquo; was possibly the first&mdash;or first surviving&mdash;of Ruskin&rsquo;s <xref type="note" doc="note" target="newyearspoems">New Year&rsquo;s Poems</xref>; <xref type="internal" doc="internal" target="DISCUSSION">see Discussion</xref>). Moreover, this instance of a parent&rsquo;s annotating a poem with a date earlier than surrounding poems is not unique, occurring also in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref> (see <xref type="works" doc="works" target="2#date">&ldquo;Glen of Glenfarg&rdquo; (&ldquo;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&rdquo;): Date</xref>), and, in that instance, Cook and Wedderburn do accept, inconsistently, the parent&rsquo;s authority. Finally, it seems implausible that Margaret would have written 1826 for 1827 without noticing the error, since her note about the date of the whole of <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="1">MS I</xref> (which is unquestioned) is placed immediately below.</p>
<p>Without following Cook and Wedderburn in their argument for dating &ldquo;The Needless Alarm&rdquo; to some time after <xref type="works" doc="works" target="5">&ldquo;When furious up from mines the water pours&rdquo; [&ldquo;The Steam Engine&rdquo;]</xref>, one might, however, accept their suggestion that Margaret intends &ldquo;Jan 1826&rdquo; to refer to all four poems preceding her note. This possibility is admitted in dating the other three poems&mdash;<xref type="works" doc="works" target="5">&ldquo;When furious up from mines the water pours&rdquo; [&ldquo;The Steam Engine&rdquo;]</xref>, <xref type="works" doc="works" target="6">&ldquo;On Scotland,&rdquo;</xref> and <xref type="works" doc="works" target="7">&ldquo;The Defiance of War&rdquo;</xref>&mdash;but, again, the interpretation supplants a more obvious and convincing explanation. Collingwood associated one poem in the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="msipoetryanthology">MS I Poetry Anthology</xref>, <xref type="works" doc="works" target="6">&ldquo;On Scotland&rdquo;</xref>&mdash;along with another, <xref type="works" doc="works" target="2">&ldquo;Glen of Glenfarg&rdquo; (&ldquo;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&rdquo;)</xref>&mdash;with the family&rsquo;s visit to Scotland in 1826, which he assumed to have started &ldquo;about the middle of May&rdquo; (<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="poems4d1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</xref>, 1:xxiii; <xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="poems8d1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [8<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</xref>, 1:ix). We now know that this journey was taken, if at all, later in that year&mdash;a fact consistent with the placement of <xref type="works" doc="works" target="6">&ldquo;On Scotland&rdquo;</xref> toward the end of <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="1">MS I</xref>, which was &ldquo;finished about Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1827&rdquo; (see <xref type="note" doc="note" target="tours1826-27">Tours of 1826&ndash;27</xref>).<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works1ffn2">2</xref></hi> All the evidence falls into place if Collingwood&rsquo;s original interpretation is accepted&mdash;namely, that &ldquo;The Needless Alarm&rdquo; is a year older than its surrounding poems. This conclusion also seems corroborated by internal evidence of the poem&rsquo;s sources (<xref type="internal" doc="internal" target="DISCUSSION">see Discussion</xref>).</p>

<head type="subheading">Sources</head>
<p>This little tale about a mouse and a dog suggests the influence of <xref type="note" doc="note" target="barbauld">Anna Laetitia Barbauld</xref>, whose books, such as <hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home,</hi> are believed to have been in the Ruskin family library (see <xref type="note" doc="note" target="boyhoodbooks">Ruskin&rsquo;s Boyhood Books</xref>). No tale in <hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi> resembles &ldquo;The Needless Alarm&rdquo; specifically, although Ruskin&rsquo;s poem does recall the tales generally, except for the lack of Mrs. Barbauld&rsquo;s conventional closing morals. Even she, however, could occasionally relax this requirement, such as in &ldquo;The History and Adventures of a Cat,&rdquo; which relates a cat&rsquo;s life from its own point of view and without didacticism.</p>
<p>Barbauld was in keeping with Ruskin&rsquo;s other reading and imitative writing of 1826&ndash;27, her work having been recommended for younger children by <xref type="note" doc="note" target="edgeworthrl">Richard Lovell Edgeworth</xref> and <xref type="note" doc="note" target="edgeworthmaria">Maria Edgeworth</xref>. If the Ruskins followed the Edgeworths&rsquo; advice that children advance by stages through reading of increasing difficulty, &ldquo;The Needless Alarm&rdquo; represents his response to an earlier stage of reading&mdash;as compared, for example, with the more advanced scientific interests represented in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="1">MS I</xref> by the poem <xref type="works" doc="works" target="5">&ldquo;When furious up from mines the water pours&rdquo; [&ldquo;The Steam Engine&rdquo;]</xref> and by the &ldquo;lessons&rdquo; in <xref type="works" doc="works" target="3">&ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Vol. 1</xref>, copied from <xref type="note" doc="note" target="joycejeremiah">Jeremiah Joyce</xref>.</p>
<head type="subheading">Occasion</head>
<p>If the &ldquo;Jan 1826&rdquo; notation does refer specifically to &ldquo;The Needless Alarm,&rdquo; it is possible that Ruskin presented the poem (perhaps in another form, now lost) as a <xref type="note" doc="note" target="newyearspoems">New Year&rsquo;s Poem</xref> for his parents&mdash;an occasion Margaret would surely have remembered. Poems, presented specifically to his father, did unquestionably become a New Year&rsquo;s tradition starting the following year, in 1827, with <xref type="works" doc="works" target="4">&ldquo;Time: Blank Verse.&rdquo;</xref> This interpretation is supported, albeit weakly, by the placement of &ldquo;The Needless Alarm&rdquo; in the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="msipoetryanthology">MS I Poetry Anthology</xref>, which is similar to the position of <xref type="works" doc="works" target="4">&ldquo;Time: Blank Verse&rdquo;</xref> in the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="msiiipoetryanthology2">MS III Second Poetry Anthology</xref>. There, in the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="redbook">Red Book</xref> containing <xref type="works" doc="works" target="20">&ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Vol. 2</xref>, the prose lessons are followed by a group of poems, just as in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="1">MS I</xref>; and that group of poems in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref> includes the previous year&rsquo;s <xref type="note" doc="note" target="newyearspoems">New Year&rsquo;s Poem</xref>, along with the new one. The <xref type="note" doc="note" target="msipoetryanthology">MS I Poetry Anthology</xref> may likewise include the previous New Year&rsquo;s gift poem. All this, however, is highly conjectural.</p>

<p>In <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref>, &ldquo;Glen of Glenfarg&rdquo; (&ldquo;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&rdquo;) is the seventh poem in <xref type="note" doc="note" target="poetrydiscriptive">Poetry Descriptive</xref>.

<p>September 1826 (or possibly fall/winter 1827).</p>
<p>At the bottom of the first page in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref> containing this poem (it continues onto the next page), <xref type="note" doc="note" target="ruskinmargaret">Margaret Ruskin</xref> wrote &ldquo;Sep<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> 1826&rdquo; (in the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="libraryedition">Library Edition</xref>, the hand is incorrectly attributed to <xref type="note" doc="note" target="ruskinjohnjames">John James Ruskin</xref> [<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="jrworksle">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></xref>, 2:257n]). The date appears to refer to this poem in particular, rather than to the entire group of poems to which it belongs, <xref type="note" doc="note" target="poetrydiscriptive">Poetry Descriptive</xref>, a group that dates from a year later, fall/winter 1827 (see <xref type="works" doc="works" target="12#date">&ldquo;Wales&rdquo;: Date</xref>; and for another case in which Ruskin&rsquo;s parents probably dated a poem separately from the group to which it belongs, see <xref type="works" doc="works" target="1#date">&ldquo;The Needless Alarm&rdquo;: Date</xref>).</p>
<p><xref type="note" doc="note" target="collingwoodwg">W. G. Collingwood</xref> believed that &ldquo;Glen of Glenfarg&rdquo; (&ldquo;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&rdquo;) was inspired by the Ruskins&rsquo; passing through <xref type="note" doc="note" target="glenfarg">Glen Farg</xref>, in the course of a visit to the family of John James&rsquo;s sister, <xref type="note" doc="note" target="richardsonjessie">Jessie Richardson</xref>, in <xref type="note" doc="note" target="perth">Perth</xref>, Scotland. Collingwood assumed they would have started in mid-May, as became usual in later years, and he reasoned, therefore, that Ruskin must have composed this poem dated September 1826 &ldquo;during the journey home&rdquo; from this visit (although Collingwood left open the possibility that the family also made an autumn visit, separate from and in addition to the spring journey [<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="poems4d1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891)</xref>, 1:xxiii; <xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="poems8d1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (8<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891)</xref>, 1:x]). We now know that, in 1826, owing to a &ldquo;barren year&rdquo; in business, John James was kept away from <xref type="note" doc="note" target="hernehill">Herne Hill</xref> by unusually lengthy business travel until well after his May birthday, and the family holiday was consequently delayed (<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref>, 1:137, 149, 150 n. 5). Also, any such family journey would have been delayed, and even prevented, owing to the illness and death by consumption of Ruskin&rsquo;s cousin, <xref type="note" doc="note" target="richardsonjames">James Richardson</xref>, which did cause Ruskin&rsquo;s parents to visit Scotland in April of that year, but it is unclear whether Ruskin accompanied them (<xref type="internal" doc="internal" target="DISCUSSION">see Discussion</xref>; and <xref type="note" doc="note" target="tours1826-27">Tours of 1826&ndash;27</xref>). Of course, even if Ruskin himself did not travel to Scotland in 1826, nothing prevents his having written in September about <xref type="note" doc="note" target="glenfarg">Glen Farg</xref>. It is also possible, however, that Margaret was simply mistaken in dating the poem September 1826, and that it belongs&mdash;along with the other poem in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref> on <xref type="note" doc="note" target="glenfarg">Glen Farg</xref>, <xref type="works" doc="works" target="23">&ldquo;Glen of Glenfarg&rdquo; (&ldquo;Papa how pretty those icicles are&rdquo;)</xref>, which exists in a firmly dated New Year&rsquo;s 1828 version&mdash;to fall/winter 1827.</p>

<p>This poem should not definitively be glossed by Ruskin&rsquo;s eyewitness experience of travel to Scotland, as the poem itself forms one of the very few scraps of evidence that he ever took such a journey with his parents prior to 1827; see <xref type="note" doc="note" target="tours1822-25">Tours of 1822&ndash;25</xref>, and <xref type="note" doc="note" target="tours1826-27">Tours of 1826&ndash;27</xref>.

<p>chap I<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn1">1</xref></hi></p>
<p>mamma said Lucy papa has gone out to town earlyer than usual.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn2">2</xref></hi> Has he any business more to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes Lucy he has more to do because he has got to go to town and then into the city and then to the docks and you know that that takes up more time than plain going to town.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn3">3</xref></hi></p>
<p>Yes mamma. But I wonder what my white rabbit is doing all this while.</p>
<p>I should think it is wondering what is become of you said her mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go and see it said Lucy.</p>
<p>you cannot in the rain said her mother.</p>
<p>oh is it raining cried Lucy I am very sorry for I have so many things to do. but however I have plenty of things to do in the house as well said Lucy[!]&rdquo;</p>
<p>yes you have answered her mother.</p>
<p>But may I draw that head which I was drawing last night said Lucy[?]&rdquo;</p>
<p>yes but had not you better go on with that landscape which you were doing last week do one thing at once.</p>
<p>Yes mamma said Lucy but how comes this pencils are lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is very odd indeed for I know that from your your youth you never lost any thing said her mother.</p>
<p>Yes said Lucy. but they are certainly gone for where could it[strikethrough] they[above line] have gone but in the sideboard and they are not there[?]&rdquo;</p>
<p>but I have found them cried her mother</p>
<p>have you cried Lucy where were they</p>
<p>in the oddest thing said her mother</p>
<p>But where said Lucy.</p>
<p>in my workbox[!]&rdquo;</p>
<p>well done you think that this is pretty well done said Lucy[?]&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I will run out and refresh myself a little now it has done raining said Lucy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes my dear said her mother and I will go and see my white rabbit said Lucy.</p>
<p>Well I think I have been out enough said Lucy[!]&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes my dear said her mother</p>
<p>Now mamma here is dinner.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn4">4</xref></hi></p>
<p>mamma my white rabbit has got young ones said Lucy and they are such pretty ones one black and white and another red and white and another quite white in short of all colours[!]&rdquo;</p>
<p>and how many in number said her mother.</p>
<p>ten said Lucy.</p>
<p>And eleven in all said her mother</p>
<p>Yes said Lucy eleven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well you are getting a fine stock plainly said her mother.</p>
<p>Yes mamma I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we ought to break off this discourse<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn5">5</xref></hi> about your rabbits and get that of your silkworms said her mother. How are they getting on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>very well said Lucy one of them has spun a great deal of silk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>have any of them spun all they are going to spin said her mother</p>
<p>Yes said Lucy three of them[!]&rdquo;</p>
<p>thats a great deal said her mother  let us go and wind it all on winders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes said Lucy so we will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>how long do you think it will take to wind one ball said her mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>two hours said Lucy.</p>
<p>three said her mother and how many will three threes make said her mother</p>
<p>nine said Lucy.</p>
<p>so nine whole hours must be spent upon these hours[strikethrough] balls[above the line] said her mother.</p>
<p>Yes said Lucy.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn6">6</xref></hi></p>
<p>Well these are very large balls said her mother[!]&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes said Lucy[!]&rdquo;</p>
<p>mamma when we were at the seaside we were told that the thread of the silk worms was two or three miles in length.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes said her mother and is not that a good length[?]&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes said Lucy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well I think we have had thought enough for the present said her mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have just two or three questions to ask you more said Lucy mother[strikethrough]</p>
<p>Well said Lucy how thin is the thinnest of the threads which spin si[strikethrough] silkworms spin.</p>
<p>I do not my dear know</p>
<p>Very well said Lucy</p>
<p>What is your next question my dear[strikethrough?]</p>
<p>what is the size of the thickest thread as thin as a spiders[above line/strikethrough, and repeated word]</p>
<p></p>
<p>chap II</p>
<p>P<hi rend="smallcaps">apa</hi> by this time had come home and Lucy then marched up to him and said papa would you be so good as to hear me my lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I will if I have time my dear but I fear I shall not have time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very well said Lucy. Not in the mornings. But in the evenings you will. And would you be so good as to hear me my lesson now.</p>
<p>Yes I will Lucy answered her father.&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn7">7</xref></hi></p>
<p>Lucy said her lesson very well and after that her mother said[: &ldquo;]I was wondering what made Lucy not come to say her lesson to me and now I find out the cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes said her father.</p>
<p>Well Lucy you have said your lesson very well and in reward for so doing after church you shall take a very pleasant walk with me said her mother.</p>
<p>and now Lucy has gone to bed and we shall have time to attend to harry whose history we have hitherto forgot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>in the last volumes of harry and Lucy my young readers may recollect that harrys father said he would take him into town to see the apparatus for making ice and harry had been with his father to see this apparratus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>the apparatus was a very large airpump and harry looking in saw large pieces of ice in it. He said he could not explain it to Lucy because he did not see that part of the apparatus which made the ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucy said she did not mind losing that only that she wished harry would go on with science.</p>
<p>harry said he would and the moment that I have time added he so Ill do that Lucy.</p>
<p>When will you brother</p>
<p>To morrow.</p>
<p>Have you not time to day brother.</p>
<p>No Lucy.</p>
<p>Well I can easily wait can I not brother.</p>
<p>Yes Lucy.</p>
<p>And said her father now I will show you some experiments on sound.</p>
<p>That will do nicely papa said Lucy</p>
<p>Then come upstairs to the workshop said her father. Harry and Lucy followed him quickly</p>
<p>As soon as they came to the workshop took[strikethrough] their father took a little balloon filled it with gunpowder and hung it up at a pole in the room. Then he set fire to it and the noise was so much that it was near deaf{en}ing[f over v] harry and Lucy  Afterwards he took another and hung it up at such a<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn8">8</xref></hi> height that it was hardly perceptible then he set fire to it by setting fire to a rod that communicated with it and the noise could not be heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now said her father how much do you think was [the(?)] distance between the height of these two balloons. they answered half a mile  Right said her father. And did you not observe that you did not hear the noise the very moment that I set fire to the balloon but in a few moments afterwards. And you observed that you did not hear the noise so quickly in the higher one as in the lower[lower over top of smaller] one.</p>
<p>Yes answered Lucy.  what was the cause of that</p>
<p>The cause was that sound travels slowly and the distance between the lower balloon and the higher one being great the sound had to travel over that height of the larger pole and that sound was longer in coming down the higher pole than the lower one because of their height</p>
<p>I understand you perfectly said Lucy.</p>
<p>Now I will show you one other experiment said her father.</p>
<p>Then he took a pipe of gunpowder and one of water communicated them together and bid harry apply his ear to the end of the one of water and having set fire to the gunpowder the noise was as loud as a cannon. This then proved that water is a good conductor  Next day harry took Lucy and took her into his garden and then showed her a little canal he had made and a little boat with some blocks fastened together by wedges then he placed a great many shores or bits of wood under the blocks and giving two or three blows on the wedges out they flew the blocks sunk and the boat hung on the shores<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn9">9</xref></hi></p>
<p>Lucy now recollected a promise harry had made her to show her how ships were floated into docks to be repaired.</p>
<p>Harry told her she was right.</p>
<p>But how did you manage to make these shores so that they would hold the vessel so firmly and upright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That would take us up too long a time standing here said harry.</p>
<p>Well then come into the house if you will.</p>
<p>No said harry. We can walk about the garden and then I can tell you.</p>
<p>Yes answered Lucy.</p>
<p>They are just plainly sticks of wood but I managed to set them so as to cross each other so that the ship went in between the shores and so was held up by them.</p>
<p>Lucy now reminded harry of his promise about science. But he said he must learn his latin lessons first so they parted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucy ran about the garden a little while. Then recollecting her brother she ran in to him to ask him if he was ready  he was ready and then Lucy went to the workshop with harry.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>chapter III</p>
<p>H<hi rend="smallcaps">arry</hi> now took a cane and bent it and then letting go it flew with such force that it broke the window.</p>
<p>Ha ha says harry[above the line] this is not such a very good thing is it Lucy. No it is not said Lucy. But we will not let our spirits go by this let us run and tell mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes said Lucy</p>
<p>They both ran to her. mamma we have broke the window.</p>
<p>She took out two balls from her worktable. You shall have these in reward  In reward interrupted both harry and Lucy at once in reward for breaking the window what can you mean mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No not in reward for breaking the window not[not above strikethrough but] in reward for breaking the window but in reward for coming and telling me of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ho ho so that is the reason mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes that is it my dears.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn10">10</xref></hi></p>
<p>Harry and Lucy then went out in search of the cane but they could not find it do what they would. At last Lucy suggested it might have stuck in a tree and as they went home they found it up in a large oak tree. The next thing to settle was how to get it down they first they[above line] thought of shaking it but then they could not shake it because it was too firm  Next they thought of climbing but the tree was too rugged for that  Next they thought of felling it but they remembered that the tree was not theirs and they must not fell it so they were in a great perplexity.</p>
<p>At last they saw a man passing by and they asked him whether it might be felled.</p>
<p>He said that it was his and they might cut it down.</p>
<p>He went and got a man who would cut it for them. And they got the cane and went merrily<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn11">11</xref></hi> home.</p>
<p>Harry did not dare to do that again but as soon as they came home he took a tube bent it filled it with water placed it upright in a pond and disturbing the water the water in the pipe flew up in the air and down as if it was a fountain</p>
<p>Lucy asked harry to leave the pipe in the pond and he did.</p>
<p>It just now happenned that Lucys mother wanted her Lucy did not know for what only her mother wanted her</p>
<p></p>
<p>chap 4</p>
<p>H<hi rend="smallcaps">arry</hi> launched his little boat but the water flowed into it. The pumps were sounded but all in vain the vessel sunk it went quite down the canal was too deep to get it up again harry was in a puzzle.</p>
<p>At last lucy came they entangled a rope in all sorts of knots and bows and let it down into the water it entangled the vessel and brought it up again.</p>
<p>Harry set to work to stop the leak and in a day did it. Next he put it into the water and it swam.</p>
<p>Now harry wanted a kite and at last his mother gave him one. One day when he was flying it Lucy came to him and told him that she had lost his boat[,] and that it had had some water in it.</p>
<p>This let harry know that he had not completely stopped the leak but in half a day he stopped it but they had a good search for it first. Lucy thought that it might have been thrown into a certain closet which she knew and there it was harry poured out the water and was done with it[!]&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now harry had a long while, been thinking [ . . .(?)]<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn12">12</xref></hi></p>
<p>[ . . . (?)] this but at last she did. She said[,]</p>
<p>a mans finger is for a child too large</p>
<p>right said harry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>a leaf[f over ve] is a Leaf but it grows on a root.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucy found out this too  again she said[,]</p>
<p>a tree grows on a root and the leaf on a tree.</p>
<p>Harry said she was right.</p>
<p>a little book is made of paste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer was[,]</p>
<p>The side of a book is made of paste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alls right we have done with our riddles.</p>
<p>What only three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>threes enough.</p>
<p>We will have some more riddles some other time.</p>
<p>So we will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first thing Harry and Lucy did when the morning came was to make some grand scheme It was settled thus  Lucy was appointed to go into a bush by which her mother always passed, while harry made a cave. This cave had holes in the top and had a chair in it</p>
<p></p>
<p>chap 5</p>
<p>N<hi rend="smallcaps">ow</hi> Lucy waited till her mother passed the bush and then suddenly darting out seized her and carried her away to harrys cave where she sat quietly and read.</p>
<p>But besides reading her mother had other amusements prepared for her. Harry had taken one of Lucys rabbits a parrot canary finch bullfinch sparrow and robin redbreast and had put them into a little hole in the bottom of the cave and then opening it all of them marched out the rabbit munching parrot talking canary singing bully cheaping robin hopping and went dancing and flying and eating and hopping and jumping all over the green.</p>
<p>Lucys mother laughed heartily at this and so did Lucy for harry had kept it a secret even from her.</p>
<p>Now they went in and harry was dressing himself when he was interrupted by Lucy running jumping and cutting capers.</p>
<p>Why whats the matter my dear.</p>
<p>Harry do you know we are going to the seaside again.</p>
<p>Is this true cried<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn13">13</xref></hi> harry.</p>
<p>it is true  we are to set off this afternoon[noon above the line] dress yourself as fast as you can be ready.</p>
<p>Lucy prounounced the words as fast as she could that was the why that she forgot the part of speech<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn14">14</xref></hi> and Harry got ready as fast as he could and in a few minutes was seated opposite to his father with Lucy away they went.</p>
<p>Presently they saw such a beautiful chain of mountains that they thought they had been made by mens hands.</p>
<p>After a little while they came to a wood a league every way in size but so beautiful they quite wondered  Next they came to a river and they were to ride along the side of it. It was beautiful the water curling so nice and dashing against rocks and now they got to the inn.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn15">15</xref></hi></p>
<p></p>
<p>chap 6</p>
<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">he</hi> inn was close by the bank of the river to harry and Lucys joy but there was more joy for them they were to go to the sea now all in one stage only stopping to change horses after having had a little wine they set out again on their journey first of all they came to a house where they saw a very large white cat even they could not see one spot of black upon it. just like the froth of the sea said Lucy</p>
<p>Nonsense Mrs hic haee hoc<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn16">16</xref></hi> said harry.</p>
<p>Ha ha thats an odd allusion said Lucy</p>
<p>a T as crooked as an o.</p>
<p>Ha ha ha ha you will come to nonsense at last harry.</p>
<p>No said harry youll get to nonsense.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn17">17</xref></hi></p>
<p>[Lots(?)] nonsense. What a great many words about one thing said Lucy.</p>
<p>So much the better said harry.</p>
<p>So much the worse said Lucy</p>
<p>Look look look father cried harry do you see that.</p>
<p>No I do not what is it.</p>
<p>The fact was that harry had seen a waggon strike a spark from the road and that set fire to a tree and harry had seen it blazing.</p>
<p>Thats a bad job indeed said his father dont you observe it is close to a little cottage and it may set fire to it.</p>
<p>No papa said harry no because though I see the cottage I also observe it is sheltered by a ditch which is wet and if the flames come to it they will quickly be quenched</p>
<p>But remember harry that little water will not quench much fire</p>
<p>But theres a great deal of water in the ditch.</p>
<p>Oh then I am not so much concerned.</p>
<p>No papa look the flames are fast quenching and now they are out.</p>
<p>Yes said his father</p>
<p>Look look what is that gently moving up and down sometimes a little froth appearing</p>
<p>give me my telescope harry and I[&rsquo;]ll tell you.</p>
<p>Its the sea.</p>
<p>the sea</p>
<p>Yes the sea</p>
<p>a shout of joy followed</p>
<p>What is that town</p>
<p>hastings</p>
<p>Wheres hastings</p>
<p>by the sea side</p>
<p>Are we going to hastings.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>By this time they had got to the entrance of hastings and went to a hotel where they had a full view of the sea and harry saw a two master which he showed to Lucy</p>
<p></p>
<p>chap 7</p>
<p>N<hi rend="smallcaps">ext</hi> day their father took them out in a pleasure boat which harry and Lucy liked very much harry now got a little dog and he used to take great pleasure in giving him a swim by throw{ing} a stick into the water and making him swim after it. one day as harry was sailing his boat without a string a surge lifting it high aloft threw it upon the beach and immediately fell upon it when it again was afloat as it turned its sides to the sun it looked as if it were made of diamonds. harrys little dog then came prancing in and seeing the boat jumped into the water caught it in his mouth and before harry could prevent him gnawed it to peices  Harry finding that amusement stopped amused himself for some time with his dog and then went in  Papa and he then went out for a walk and after having climbed a high hill they came on a sort of plain composed of a great many fields only separated by hedges and where they had a full view of the sea and harry got a large nosegay of wildflowers Harry then went home with his father and after dinner went out again upon the beach and coming in took tea and went to bed.</p>
<p>Next morning they were awakened by their fathers calling come here harry he ran to his father and they saw a great light about a mile from the shore but they soon saw what it was for a great many beams rafters and bits of wood on fire blew up in the air with a tremendous explosion and in an instant all the fire<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn18">18</xref></hi> was out.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn19">19</xref></hi></p>
<p>Harrys father now said that it was a ship on fire and on looking through his telescope observed a board floating on to the shore that bore evident marks of being thoroughly burnt and Harry agreed in his opinion  Now Harry went to Lucy to remind her of riddles and he began.</p>
<p>three parts of a cross</p>
<p>and a circle complete</p>
<p>two semicircles</p>
<p>perpendicular meet</p>
<p>an angle standing on two feet</p>
<p>two semicircles and a circle complete</p>
<p>I know that riddle it&rsquo;s tobacco said Lucy.</p>
<p>Yes it is said Harry but how does it make tobacco.</p>
<p>three parts of a cross make T and a circle complete O two semicircles perpendicular meet B an angle standing on two feet A two semicircles and a circle complete double C and O  Yes said Harry but I will give you another</p>
<p>two letter s each</p>
<p>and each a half</p>
<p>of what the beach</p>
<p>was involved in</p>
<p>fire said Lucy</p>
<p>Yes it is fire and we have done</p>
<p></p>
<p>chap 8</p>
<p>Harry went out upon the beach with his dog and brought in to Lucy such a store of shells that she wondered how he could pick up so many without his back aching  But Harry told her that he had quite changed since that time and was counting all the shells over when he was interrupted by dinner after dinner Harry learned all his lessons drew a little took tea and went to bed.</p>
<p>Next morning Harry went out upon the beach for the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> time and this time he brought spars and pieces of ore to Lucy instead of shells. But here he was stopped by going out for a walk they climbed a high hill and went on sometimes by the sides of rivulets at other times half rubbing against hedges but oftenest so attracted by the bubbling of a pure clear stream that they were like to jump <hi rend="italic">into</hi> it they went through dark avenues and between hedges forming a sort of foot-path sometimes a full view of the sea sometimes none at all till unexpectedly they arrived at home.</p>
<p>Harry sat down to draw and had just done part of the trunk of a tree when a carriage drove to the door.</p>
<p>Who is it said Harry looking out.</p>
<p>It was only an arrival.</p>
<p>Harry sat down again and finished his tree but they were soon turned out of their apartment and put into another for they were<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn20">20</xref></hi> told that the person who had just come in wanted their apartments.</p>
<p>After dinner it being the longest day tea came in <hi rend="italic">seemingly</hi> at three o-clock  when it was seven harry going to bed at nine had only two hours to play which he spent in drawing and went to bed.</p>
<p>Next morning after breakfast Harry determined to go on with science and told Lucy he must begin with pneumatics he said that this science treated of the pressure and springiness of the air.</p>
<p>Remembering that Lucy wanted to see the guinea and feather fall with equal velocities he took a guinea and a feather set them on a brass flap and put the flap under the receiver of his air pump shut it up in a little notch and exhausting the air turned a little wire and the flap slipped down and the guinea and feather fell with equal velocities and no noise.</p>
<p>Lucy was surprised at this but harry said that it was only because the air was taken away<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn21">21</xref></hi></p>
<p>Harry now said he would describe the airgun to Lucy.</p>
<p>What is an airgun said Lucy</p>
<p>It is a sort of musket that acts by air instead of gunpowder.</p>
<p>How does it act by air instead of gunpowder.</p>
<p>There is a ball of condensed air which is screwed to the barrel of the gun and there is a valve in the ball opening inwards and when the ball is screwed on and the bullet in the trigger is pulled back which forces down a hook upon a pin connected with the valve and liberates a portion of the condensed air this rushing through a hole in the lock into the barrel will impel the bullet to a great distance.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn22">22</xref></hi></p>
<p>What is the <hi rend="italic">eolian harp</hi> said Lucy.</p>
<p>It is a sort of harp that acts by air instead of the hands for the air sweeping along the strings of the harp makes them vibrate and produces the sound.</p>
<p>What are the principal conductors of common sound said Lucy.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn23">23</xref></hi></p>
<p>They are flannel water air which last is absolutely necessary to sound.</p>
<p>Will you prove that to me said Lucy</p>
<p>Yes I will said Harry.</p>
<p>Harry then took a bell and put it in the receiver exhausting the air and bidding Lucy look at the clapper of the bell he shook the air pump.</p>
<p>I see plainly the clapper knocks the side of the bell but I hear no noise said Lucy.</p>
<p>That is because there is no air inside listen again.</p>
<p>I hear the bell very plainly now said Lucy.</p>
<p>That is because I admitted the air said harry</p>
<p>But why did you shake the air pump could not you shake the reciever [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] said Lucy</p>
<p>No I could not for the air was pressing it firmly down to the bottom of the airpump<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn24">24</xref></hi>  But said harry looking at his watch I must leave you now or I shall not have time for my lessons</p>
<p></p>
<p>chap 9</p>
<p>H<hi rend="smallcaps">arry</hi> now determined to have another grand scheme so he took a handfull of earth moistened it with water and stuck it onto the green. He then took another handfull and treated it in the same manner till he had formed a large ball of the shape of an orange he then divided it into divisions and wrote upon some of them africa on others <hi rend="smallcaps">america</hi> iceland <hi rend="smallcaps">spitzbergen novazem</hi>bla<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn25">25</xref></hi> and all the countries he could remember and when his mamma and papa saw this whenever they were at a loss for the situation of any country they went to harrys globe for satisfaction</p>
<p>This scheme being finished harry went on with science. Harry said he would show Lucy a very entertaining experiment so he took a strong copper vessel filled it half full of water and took a syringe and screwed it to a pipe with this he forced a considerable quantity of air into the vessel so that the air was very much condensed he then turned a stop-cock while he took off the syringe and no water could escape but putting a jet instead of a syringe and turning the stop-cock the air in the vessel forced the water through the jet to a great height.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn26">26</xref></hi></p>
<p>Harry then took a little square bottle and he cemented to it a screw-valve by which he fixed it on the plate of the airpump and exhausted the air and the pressure of the atmosphere upon the glass broke it into a thousand pieces.</p>
<p>Lucy asked why he had chosen a <hi rend="italic">square</hi> bottle instead of a <hi rend="italic">round</hi> one.</p>
<p>Because one of that shape would have sustained the pressure like an arch.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn27">27</xref></hi></p>
<p>Harry then took a jar of water and put in some pieces of iron zinc and stone &amp;c then he exhausted the air and the elastic spring of air contained in the stone forced the water out of it in a multitude of globules forming a very pleasing spectacle<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn28">28</xref></hi></p>
<p>After that Harry took a piece of cork and tied a piece of lead to it just enough to make it sink he then removed the air and then the cork brought the lead up to the surface.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn29">29</xref></hi></p>
<p>Then Harry took a piece<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn30">30</xref></hi> of cork and a piece of lead and balanced them on a scale-beam and exhausting the air the cork was heavier than the lead.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn31">31</xref></hi></p>
<p>Harry then took a poker and tied a strip of flannel round the middle of it but leaving both the ends untied he tied the two ends round Lucys first finger of each hand and then bid Lucy put these fingers into each of her ears and strike the poker against the fender and the sound returned was astonishing that made by a loud church bell was not to be compared with it.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn32">32</xref></hi></p>
<p>After that Harry took a very shrivelled apple and put it under the receiver and it appeared as fine an apple as it was when first taken from the tree but admitting the air it was as shrivelled as ever.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn33">33</xref></hi></p>
<p>Then harry took a marble and shot it against the wainscot and it returned to his hand he told Lucy that the line it described in coming from the wainscot was called the line of <hi rend="italic">reflection</hi> and the line in going <hi rend="italic">to it</hi> the line of <hi rend="italic">incidence</hi>.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn34">34</xref></hi></p>
<p>After that Harry took a new laid egg and made a hole in the <hi rend="italic">small</hi> end of it putting it under the reciever [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of the airpump in an aleglass and the pressure of the bubble of air found in the broad end of new laid eggs forced all the contents of the egg out into the aleglass.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn35">35</xref></hi></p>
<p>Then Harry took a small glass can filled with water and three little images floating at the top he then tied little weights to them so that they descended to the bottom but on removing the air they ascended to the top dragging the weights after them<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn36">36</xref></hi></p>
<p>The time had been so pleasantly taken up by these experiments that Harry did not hear his mother call him and he staid away a whole hour later than he should have done for he always went to his lessons at twelve and he staid till one but now he went to them</p>
<p></p>
<p>chap 10</p>
<p>H<hi rend="smallcaps">arry</hi> now went out upon the beach and dug a deep hole in it which to his surprise he found full of different coloured sea shells and what made it the more wonderful was that the further he dug the more shells he found. He thought this would be a fine mine to Lucy if she could get at the shells without dirtying her frock but he was afraid she would not he led her to the place but he found she could not so that he was obliged to pick up as many as he could reach and go home.</p>
<p>Harry sat down to draw and had just said How very few people come to this inn when another carriage drove to the door. Harry knew very well what it was and went on with his drawing but Lucy soon called him away and bid him observe a great black cloud from the north which seemed rather electrical Harry ran for an electrical apparatus which his father had given him and the cloud electrified his apparatus positively<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn37">37</xref></hi> after that another cloud came which electrified his apparatus negatively and then a long train of smaller ones but before this cloud came a great cloud of dust rose from the ground and followed the positive cloud and at length seemed to come in contact with it and when the other cloud came a flash of lightning was seen to dart through the cloud of dust upon which the negative clouds spread very much and dissolved in rain which presently cleared the sky<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn38">38</xref></hi></p>
<p>After this phenomenon was over and also the surprise Harry began to wonder<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn39">39</xref></hi> how electricity could get where there was so much water but he soon observed a rainbow and a rising mist under it which his fancy soon transformed into a female form. He then remembered the witch of the waters at the Alps who was raised from them by takeing some water in the hand and throwing it into the air pronouncing some unintelligable words<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works3c0fn40">40</xref></hi> And though it was a tale it affected Harry now when he saw in the clouds something like it</p>

<p>September or October 1826 through January 1827.</p>
<p><xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="1">MS I</xref>, which is nearly entirely taken up by &ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Vol. 1, was dated by <xref type="note" doc="note" target="ruskinmargaret">Margaret Ruskin</xref> as having been &ldquo;begun about Sep<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> or Oct 1826&rdquo; and &ldquo;finished about Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1827.&rdquo; Since she inserted her notation within the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="msipoetryanthology">MS I Poetry Anthology</xref> at the end of the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="redbook">Red Book</xref>, it seems probable that Ruskin had devoted the latter part of that time to fair-copying and/or composing the poems, while spending the fall/winter of 1826 on &ldquo;Harry and Lucy&rdquo; (see <xref type="works" doc="works" target="1#date">&ldquo;The Needless Alarm&rdquo;: Date</xref>; and <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="1#date">MS I: Date</xref>).</p>
<p>If the family traveled north in the autumn of 1826 (see <xref type="note" doc="note" target="tours1826-27">Tours of 1826&ndash;27</xref>), Ruskin may have written or fair-copied this narrative in quiet periods during the journey. Similarly, he may have composed and/or fair-copied <xref type="works" doc="works" target="20">&ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Vol. 2</xref>, in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref>, during the following year&rsquo;s journey to Scotland. Unlike the second volume, however, this first contains nothing about Scotland, the narrative describing travel in the opposite direction, from London to the south coast at <xref type="note" doc="note" target="hastings">Hastings</xref>.</p>
<p>At <xref type="note" doc="note" target="hastings">Hastings</xref>, Harry identifies the fourth day of the visit as &ldquo;the longest day&rdquo; of the year, which <xref type="note" doc="note" target="viljoenhg">Helen Gill Viljoen</xref> interprets as the summer solstice, June 18&ndash;25. She thus proposes that the composition date must be extended past Margaret&rsquo;s terminus for <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="1">MS I</xref>, January 1827, to some time after June 1827 (<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx">Viljoen Papers</xref>, &ldquo;Dating MSS. of Boyhood,&rdquo; boxes D.V, E.IX). She discounts the possibility that the holiday had already occurred, in June 1826, before Ruskin started work on <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="1">MS I</xref>, apparently on the grounds that the family could not have holidayed at the seaside in summer 1826, if, as <xref type="note" doc="note" target="collingwoodwg">W. G. Collingwood</xref> likewise assumed, they had departed for <xref type="note" doc="note" target="perth">Perth</xref> in May. It is now known, however, that the family departed for Scotland in the fall, not the spring (see <xref type="works" doc="works" target="2#date">&ldquo;Glen of Glenfarg&rdquo; (&ldquo;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&rdquo;): Date</xref>). Ruskin&rsquo;s recounting of events at <xref type="note" doc="note" target="hastings">Hastings</xref> as part of the tale is thus entirely plausible, without contradicting Margaret&rsquo;s date for <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="1">MS I</xref>. In fact, in chap 1, in which Harry and Lucy are shown as still at home, Lucy mentions an event &ldquo;when we were at the seaside&rdquo;&mdash;Ruskin evidently not yet having decided to carry his characters, later in the narrative, to the resort where he had visited a few months prior to composition.</p>

</div>
<div type="section" n="discussion">
<head type="subheading">Sources</head>
<p>Ruskin very cleverly adapted the prose genre of the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="lesson">lesson</xref>, which he found in <xref type="note" doc="note" target="edgeworthmaria">Maria Edgeworth</xref>, <hi rend="italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded,</hi> to depict presumably actual events at <xref type="note" doc="note" target="hernehill">Herne Hill</xref>. His writing is up to date: by the time he began his own version in 1826, Edgeworth&rsquo;s text, which was first published in 1825, cannot have been in the household for very long. Presumably, by this time, Ruskin also knew at least some of the volumes of &ldquo;early lessons&rdquo; that the 1825 volume &ldquo;concludes.&rdquo; A copy survives of <xref type="note" doc="note" target="edgeworthmaria">Maria Edgeworth</xref>, <hi rend="italic">Frank,</hi> subtitled<hi rend="italic"> A Sequel to Early Lessons</hi> (1822) and meant to follow Maria and Richard Edgeworth, <hi rend="italic">Early Lessons,</hi> that certainly belonged to Ruskin in boyhood (see <xref type="note" doc="note" target="boyhoodbooks">Ruskin&rsquo;s Boyhood Books</xref>).</p>
<p>As the writing progresses, it swerves from creative adaptation to heavy, nearly verbatim copying from <xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx">Joyce, <hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></xref>. (The change occurs most noticeably at the point at which Ruskin&rsquo;s Harry and Lucy follow their father &ldquo;upstairs to the workshop&rdquo; [chap. 2], where they engage in a series of experiments drawn directly from the <hi rend="italic">Dialogues</hi>.) This work by <xref type="note" doc="note" target="joycejeremiah">Jeremiah Joyce</xref> consists of &ldquo;conversations&rdquo; between a girl Emma, a boy Charles, and their father (and, at times, between two boys, Charles and James, and their tutor). Joyce closely follows the Edgeworths&rsquo; educational theories and their genre of the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="lesson">lesson</xref>, attributing his book&rsquo;s interlocutional method to <xref type="note" doc="note" target="edgeworthmaria">Maria Edgeworth</xref>, <hi rend="italic">Practical Education,</hi> as the most effective means of communicating ideas to children and gauging their intellectual progress. More exclusively and technically focused on scientific topics than the Edgeworths&rsquo; lessons, however, the <hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi> aim at systematically introducing the children to the major fields of scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>It is entirely in keeping with these sources that Ruskin, in the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="msipoetryanthology">MS I Poetry Anthology</xref> which follows &ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Vol. 1, heads the anthology with <xref type="works" doc="works" target="5">&ldquo;When furious up from mines the water pours&rdquo; [&ldquo;The Steam Engine&rdquo;]</xref>&mdash;a poem derived from lines by <xref type="note" doc="note" target="darwinerasmus">Erasmus Darwin</xref> that versify similar interests in scientific probing. Darwin, the Edgeworths, and (Joyce?) were associated with the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="lunarsociety">Lunar Society</xref>, which advocated scientific exploration especially as applied practically to industrial progress. Thus, Ruskin&rsquo;s earliest surviving writing is derived from study of works celebrating Enlightenment scientific and industrial entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>In chap. 1 and the first part of chap. 2, the text is apparently more original and based on actual experience (with the probable exception of the exchange about silkworms). The dialogue is nonetheless based on the <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> of discourse found in Edgeworth&rsquo;s books, such as the passage in which Ruskin has the Mamma exploit a task of winding balls of silk thread in order to quiz Lucy on the multiplication tables. Ruskin seems to relate vivid, everyday experiences with his mother, who, one might speculate, tutored her son using the educational techniques advocated in <xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx">Maria Edgeworth, <hi rend="italic">Practical Education</hi></xref>. Thus, Ruskin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Harry and Lucy&rdquo; possibly was art imitating life imitating art.</p>
<p>Dangerous experiments involving exploding gunpowder and specialized scientific apparatus are obviously fictional, as well as being copied almost verbatim from Joyce, but Ruskin did carry out some Edgeworthian projects at <xref type="note" doc="note" target="hernehill">Herne Hill</xref>. Like Harry, he built a &ldquo;cave&rdquo; in May 1826 (<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref>, 149; see chaps. 4&ndash;5), and the story of Harry&rsquo;s mud globe has the sound of reality (chap. 9), although we cannot be sure.</p>
<p>A characteristic both of his sources and of <xref type="note" doc="note" target="ruskinmargaret">Margaret Ruskin</xref> herself is the emphasis placed by Ruskin&rsquo;s fictional Mamma on &ldquo;do[ing] one thing at once.&rdquo; Learning in Edgeworth&rsquo;s <hi rend="italic">Early Lessons</hi> is measured. In Edgeworth, the mother says she will answer questions at her leisure, and only if the child minds and remembers the answer; the father checks overly eager inquiry, for &ldquo;thinking, without tiring ourselves, is very agreeable; but thinking becomes disagreeable, if we tire ourselves,&rdquo; and Frank is frequently exhorted to save until later what he cannot comprehend immediately (<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx">Maria Edgeworth, <hi rend="italic">Frank</hi></xref>, 1:120 ed???). In Joyce, procedures are likewise systematic and graduated, starting with simpler concepts in mechanics and astronomy (vol. 1), and progressing through hydrostatics and pneumatics (vol. 2), and finally optics, magnetism, electricity, and galvinism (vol. 3). Thus, in family letters, when Margaret thwarts John&rsquo;s (and his father&rsquo;s) play by insisting on finishing one project before taking up another (e.g., <xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref> ???), her methodicalness should be seen as arising, not necessarily from stiff-necked religious principles, but from advanced educational ideas.</p>
<p>If Ruskin has his fictional Mamma adopt this methodical approach, he himself is not so easily restrained. In response to Mamma&rsquo;s declaration, &ldquo;Well I think we have had thought enough for the present,&rdquo; Lucy returns &ldquo;just two or three questions&rdquo; more (chap. 1). Defying Joyce&rsquo;s system, he puts his Harry and Lucy in the middle of the curriculum&mdash;&ldquo;he must begin with pneumatics,&rdquo; Harry declares&mdash;and then, within that topic, the text works generally backwards through Joyce&rsquo;s series of experiments. Ruskin&rsquo;s Harry does appear to grasp the central purpose of Joyce&rsquo;s experiments in pneumatics&mdash;that they are meant to investigate atmospheric &ldquo;pressure and springiness,&rdquo; as Harry puts it (chap. ?)&mdash;but Joyce and the Edgeworths would have preferred that the seven-year-old Ruskin, like Frank, explore the more fundamental concept of experimentation generally, using a homely trial such as testing for effective ways to mend a broken saucer (see <hi rend="italic">Frank</hi>, part 2, in <xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx">Maria Edgeworth, <hi rend="italic">Frank</hi></xref>, 1:123&ndash;31). Instead, Ruskin&rsquo;s determination to have his own way with the system is not only precocious, but enamored of spectacle. He seems to relish the fancier hardware in Joyce&rsquo;s later chapters, and consequently sacrifices preparatory concepts.</p>
<p>If Ruskin&rsquo;s text exhibits impatience with Joyce&rsquo;s system, his verbal and pictorial illustrations reveal a steady advance in the writer&rsquo;s ability to represent complex relationships. In the &ldquo;plates&rdquo; at the beginning of the notebook, which are among the earliest surviving drawings by Ruskin, objects are lined up on a single plain, but later plates attempt more complex spacial relationships. Similarly, in verbal terms, the first portion the narrative lines up events in simple sequences, whereas, toward the end, the representation of journeying inspires a more serpentine and surprising description like this one: &ldquo;they climbed a high hill and went on sometimes by the sides of rivulets at other times half rubbing against hedges but oftenest so attracted by the bubbling of a pure clear stream that they were like to jump <hi rend="italic">into</hi> it they went through dark avenues and between hedges forming a sort of foot-path sometimes a full view of the sea sometimes none at all till unexpectedly they arrived at home&rdquo; (chap. 8). Apropos of this development, the experiments from Joyce clustered in chapters eight and nine, which appear merely to take up space with tedious copying, may have interested Ruskin with the language required to explain multiple and complex causal relationships, just as Harry poses &ldquo;riddles&rdquo; and word games to Lucy in chaps. 4 and 7.</p>
<p>It is striking that those later, improbable episodes, which Ruskin copied most directly from Joyce, center on the father character. One wonders if Ruskin needed to construct experiences with the father character directly from texts because <xref type="note" doc="note" target="ruskinjohnjames">John James Ruskin</xref> was absent on business much of the time. In the very first sentence of the narrative, Lucy remarks that &ldquo;papa has gone out to town earlyer than usual&rdquo; (chap. 1), and, when he returns, at the start of chap. 2, the father &ldquo;fear[s] I shall not have time&rdquo; to hear Lucy&rsquo;s <xref type="note" doc="note" target="lesson">lesson</xref>. The episode in which Lucy recites her <xref type="note" doc="note" target="lesson">lesson</xref> to her father does, however, have an air of reality. (By comparison, servants make no appearance in the &ldquo;Harry and Lucy&rdquo; narratives at all, his nurse <xref type="note" doc="note" target="strachanann">Ann Strachan</xref> first occurring in Iteriad????)</p>
<p>At the end of his adaptation, Ruskin&rsquo;s imitation culminates in a tour de force combining science and poetry, Joyce&rsquo;s <hi rend="italic">Dialogues</hi> and <xref type="note" doc="note" target="byron">Byron</xref>&rsquo;s <hi rend="italic">Manfred,</hi> in Harry&rsquo;s &ldquo;witch of the alps&rdquo; fantasy (chap. 10), which Ruskin made famous by reproducing in facsimile in <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi>. Poetry was not alien to the Edgeworthian <xref type="note" doc="note" target="lesson">lesson</xref>: Joyce himself ornaments his dialogues with verse quotations, albeit from Enlightenment rather than Romantic poems, and some of those quotations may have inspired Ruskin&rsquo;s choice of poems to fill out this <xref type="note" doc="note" target="redbook">Red Book</xref> in the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="msipoetryanthology">MS I Poetry Anthology</xref> (see <xref type="works" doc="works" target="5#discussion">&ldquo;When furious up from mines the water pours&rdquo; [&ldquo;The Steam Engine&rdquo;]: Discussion</xref>). In Harry&rsquo;s vision closing &ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; however, Ruskin goes beyond the verse ornamentation of scientific prose to reveal a keen consciousness of the pleasures of crossing genres, for Harry is &ldquo;affected&rdquo; by witnessing &ldquo;in the clouds something like&rdquo; an image from a poem.</p>
<p>Harry&rsquo;s &ldquo;affection&rdquo; is possibly psychological, as well as literary. For Ruskin, Harry and Lucy&rsquo;s adventures at <xref type="note" doc="note" target="hastings">Hastings</xref> would have represented a joyful release from a period of grief and loneliness earlier in the year. Business had kept Ruskin&rsquo;s father from home for an unusually extended period, and a fatal illness had deprived the boy of his cousin <xref type="note" doc="note" target="richardsonjames">James Richardson</xref>&rsquo;s companionship forever (see <xref type="works" doc="works" target="6">&ldquo;On Scotland&rdquo;</xref>). This deprivation may have influenced Ruskin&rsquo;s decision to imitate the Edgeworths&rsquo; partnership of Harry and Lucy. Not only would the fictional pairing have compensated him for losses; their activities together could have played out and controlled in fiction what Ruskin could not control in life&mdash;as when Lucy is made to bide the time, first, of a busy father, and, immediately afterward, of a preoccupied brother (chap. 2).</p>
<p>Some episodes in &ldquo;Harry and Lucy&rdquo; seem particularly poignant and psychologically suggestive, such as the children&rsquo;s kidnaping their mother to imprison her in Harry&rsquo;s &ldquo;cave,&rdquo; where she must attend to one of Harry&rsquo;s &ldquo;schemes,&rdquo; a procession of birds (chaps. 4&ndash;5). Fantasy may also enter into the concluding &ldquo;witch of the alps&rdquo; episode with its spectral female form. The passage, with its exchange of negative and positive electrical discharges, might be read as an attempt to control and neutralize some sort of trouble.</p>
<head type="subheading">Travel</head>
<p>In the second half of &ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Vol. 1, the characters visit the seaside at <xref type="note" doc="note" target="hastings">Hastings</xref> for a week, apparently recording an actual summer journey (<xref type="internal" doc="internal" target="DATE">see Date</xref>).

<p>Since <xref type="works" doc="works" target="22">&ldquo;The Sun,&rdquo;</xref> like &ldquo;Time: Blank Verse,&rdquo; is a <xref type="note" doc="note" target="newyearspoems">New Year&rsquo;s Poem</xref>, Ruskin may have celebrated the New Year for 1828 by enhancing <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref>, inserting after <xref type="works" doc="works" target="20">&ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Vol. 2</xref>, the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="msiiipoetryanthology2">MS III Second Poetry Anthology</xref>, which includes these poems.

(The <xref type="note" doc="note" target="msipoetryanthology">MS I Poetry Anthology</xref> included <xref type="works" doc="works" target="1">&ldquo;The Needless Alarm,&rdquo;</xref> which apparently had been composed a year earlier, in January 1826, and which may therefore have likewise served as a <xref type="note" doc="note" target="newyearspoems">New Year&rsquo;s Poem</xref>; see <xref type="works" doc="works" target="1#discussion">&ldquo;The Needless Alarm&rdquo;: Discussion</xref>.)</p>

<p>September1826&ndash;January 1827, most likely toward the end of that period. There is a possibility of the poem dating from as early as January1826.</p>
<p>Favoring early 1826, <xref type="note" doc="note" target="cooket">E. T.

<p>On internal evidence, &ldquo;When furious up from mines the water pours&rdquo; is more logically placed in late 1826 or early 1827, when, according to another annotation by his mother, Ruskin finished this <xref type="note" doc="note" target="redbook">Red Book</xref> (see <xref type="works" doc="works" target="1#date">&ldquo;The Needless Alarm&rdquo;: Date</xref>; <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="1#date">MS I: Date</xref>). The content of the poem, moreover, is consistent with sources of the concluding chapters of <xref type="works" doc="works" target="3">&ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Vol. 1</xref>, which precedes the anthology, and it is logical that the compositional process of the prose piece would have flowed into that of the poem.</p>

</div>
<div type="section" n="discussion">
<p>Ruskin&rsquo;s poem is based on lines on the steam engine by <xref type="note" doc="note" target="darwinerasmus">Erasmus Darwin</xref> in the &ldquo;Economy of Vegetation,&rdquo; part 1 of <hi rend="italic">The Botanic Garden</hi> (1789&ndash;91, in Darwin, <hi rend="italic">Poetical Works,</hi> 1:30&ndash;35). The relevant passage begins with a description of how the engine developed by James Watt (1736&ndash;1819) and Matthew Boulton (1728&ndash;1809)  drains mines to free the ore that, by the end of passage, is minted into coin by Boulton&rsquo;s steam-powered coin press. The Ruskins would have taken pride in the achievement by the Scotsman Watt of Glasgow, and they would have been interested that Boulton&rsquo;s coin press, placed at the climax of the description, was operated by boys of Ruskin&rsquo;s age. Boulton worked in Soho, near Birmingham, the center of the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="lunarsociety">Lunar Society</xref> of Birmingham, to which Darwin belonged.</p>
<p><hi rend="quote">The Giant-Power from earth&rsquo;s remotest caves<lb/>Lifts with strong arm her dark reluctant waves;<lb/>Each cavern&rsquo;d rock, and hidden den explores,<lb/>Drags her dark coals, and digs her shining ores.&mdash;<lb/>Next in close cells of ribbed oak confin&rsquo;d,<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works5hfn1">1</xref></hi><lb/>Gale after gale, He crowds the struggling wind;<lb/>The imprison&rsquo;d storms through brazen nostrils roar,<lb/>Fan the white flame, and fuse the sparkling ore.<lb/>Here high in air the rising stream He pours<lb/>To clay-built cisterns, or to lead-lined towers;<lb/>Fresh through a thousand pipes the wave distils,<lb/>And thirsty cities drink the exuberant rills.<lb/>There the vast mill-stone with inebriate whirl<lb/>On trembling floors his forceful fingers twirl,<lb/>Whose flinty teeth the golden harvests grind,<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works5hfn2">2</xref></hi><lb/>Feast without blood!<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works5hfn3">3</xref></hi> and nourish human-kind.<lb/>	Now his hard hands on Mona&rsquo;s rifted crest,<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works5hfn4">4</xref></hi><lb/>Bosom&rsquo;d in rock, her azure ores arrest;<lb/>With iron lips<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works5hfn5">5</xref></hi> his rapid rollers seize<lb/>The lengthening bars, in thin expansion squeeze;<lb/>Descending screws with ponderous fly-wheels wound<lb/>The tawny plates, the new medallions round;<lb/>Hard dyes of steel the cupreous circles cramp,<lb/>And with quick fall his massy hammers stamp.<lb/>The Harp, the Lily, and the Lion join,<lb/>And G<hi rend="smallcaps">eorge</hi> and B<hi rend="smallcaps">ritain</hi> guard the sterling coin.<lb/>	Soon shall thy arm, U<hi rend="smallcaps">nconquer&rsquo;d</hi> S<hi rend="smallcaps">team</hi>! afar<lb/>Drag the slow barge, or drive the rapid car;<lb/>Or on wide-waving wings expanded bear<lb/>The flying-chariot through the fields of air.<lb/>&mdash;Fair crews triumphant, leaning from above,<lb/>Shall wave their fluttering kerchiefs as they move;<lb/>Or warrior-bands alarm the gaping crowd,<lb/>And armies shrink beneath the shadowy cloud.</hi></p>
<p>Ruskin&rsquo;s adaptation adheres broadly to Darwin&rsquo;s sequence of topics, from the engine draining water from mines and raising the ore; to the narrator pausing to admire other works driven by steam, such as turning mills; and back to the engine working the bellows at the furnace to melt the ore, and powering the machine to mint coins. Ruskin ignores Darwin&rsquo;s pitch for vegetarianism, however, instead elaborating the middle section by adding a cloth mill to the grain mill, along with a story about steamboats rescuing the victims of exploding steamboats&mdash;an ironic anecdote that Ruskin enjoyed, returning to the story in ???.</p>
<p>Ruskin also appears to have misunderstood Darwin&rsquo;s instance of industrial sublime in the &ldquo;gales&rdquo; confined in oaken cylinders, substituting a literal storm in lines 2&ndash;3 of his poem (indicating, perhaps, that he did not labor through Darwin&rsquo;s appended note on the history and mechanics of steam engines, which explains Watt&rsquo;s cylinder design). Ruskin&rsquo;s entirely original contribution appears to be his ending, in which the engine produces a chain, whether a literal ornament of floral design, or a delicate figure for the reservoir waters encircling and nourishing the town.</p>
<p>Formally, Ruskin borrows Darwin&rsquo;s heroic couplets without their pomposity, catching their livelier rhyme words, such as <hi rend="italic">whirl</hi> and <hi rend="italic">twirl</hi>. (Compare similar preferences for poetic over pedantic terms in his adaptation of <xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx">Joyce, <hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></xref>, for <xref type="works" doc="works" target="3">&ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Vol. 1</xref>.) Perhaps the most important aspect of this early influence, besides the union of poetry and scientific learning, is Darwin&rsquo;s exuberance of language. As remarked in <xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx">King-Hele, &ldquo;Darwin, Man of Ideas and Inventor of Words,&rdquo;</xref> <hi rend="italic">The Botanic Garden</hi> was a major success in part because of its heightened, ornamented language, and King-Hele traces Darwin&rsquo;s extraordinary fertility in inventing words (pp. 165&ndash;68)&mdash;a form of creativity that Ruskin likewise relished, as in ??? It should be noted, however, that enthusiasm for <xref type="note" doc="note" target="darwinerasmus">Erasmus Darwin</xref> may have entailed a frisson of betrayal in the Ruskin family, as Darwin&rsquo;s old foe, the philosopher Thomas Brown (1778&ndash;1820), was a friend of <xref type="note" doc="note" target="ruskinjohnjames">John James Ruskin</xref> and his family in Edinburgh days. Brown had challenged the &ldquo;materialist&rdquo; foundations of Darwin&rsquo;s <hi rend="italic">Zoonomia</hi> (1794, 1796).</p>
<p>Ruskin may have been directed to Darwin&rsquo;s poem by Conversation 40, &ldquo;Of the Steam-Engine, and Papin&rsquo;s Digester&rdquo; in <xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx">Joyce, <hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></xref>, 2:232&ndash;33, which provides a summary of the poem. <xref type="note" doc="note" target="viljoenhg">Helen Gill Viljoen</xref> suggests that Ruskin&rsquo;s source lay in Joyce&rsquo;s summary itself, rather than in Darwin&rsquo;s poem, to which he was directed by the summary [HGVP, box D.V]; however, Darwin&rsquo;s original appears to have supplied diction and details that Ruskin could not have obtained indirectly through Joyce.</p>
<p>Ruskin appropriately positioned his poem at the head of the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="msipoetryanthology">MS I Poetry Anthology</xref>, which immediately follows <xref type="works" doc="works" target="3">&ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Vol. 1</xref>, since that text likewise draws verbatim on the <hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi> in order to supply Harry and Lucy with experiments. In fact, in chapters 8&ndash;9 of &ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Ruskin hurries Harry through a series of experiments in pneumatics drawn from Joyce, stopping just short of Conversation 40 on the steam engine, which Ruskin effectively replaces with his adaptation of Darwin&rsquo;s poem on that topic. Thus, in terms both of structure and genre, the contents of this <xref type="note" doc="note" target="redbook">Red Book</xref> might be viewed as an extended (imitation of a) <xref type="note" doc="note" target="lesson">lesson</xref>, culminating in an ode to the industrial sublime (see also <xref type="works" doc="works" target="3#discussion">&ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Vol. 1: Discussion</xref>). In its rhetoric, this structure appears related to Joyce&rsquo;s tendency in the <hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi> to embellish his prose text with quotations from Darwin and other poets of the scientific revolution. (The remaining poems in <xref type="note" doc="note" target="msipoetryanthology">MS I Poetry Anthology</xref> form a miscellany unrelated to these themes, however.)</p>

In fact, we cannot be certain that the poem is based on an actual journey of 1826 at all, at least one that Ruskin himself participated in; see <xref type="note" doc="note" target="tours1826-27">Tours of 1826&ndash;27</xref>.</p>
<p>The poem&rsquo;s trope of &ldquo;changes&rdquo; may be less seasonal than emotional, as relating to the death of Ruskin&rsquo;s cousin <xref type="note" doc="note" target="richardsonjames">James Richardson</xref>, who had been living at <xref type="note" doc="note" target="hernehill">Herne Hill</xref> and working for <xref type="note" doc="note" target="ruskintelford">Ruskin, Telford, and Domecq</xref> at least since March 1825 (see <xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref>, 131, 134n.). Apparently, plans had formed for him to travel to Spain, presumably to learn the wine business as John James had done (see <xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref>, 142), but by March or April 1826 he had grown so ill from tuberculosis that he had to return to Scotland. Doubtless anxious to protect their son, in April 1826 John James and Margaret accompanied James back to <xref type="note" doc="note" target="perth">Perth</xref>, where he died on 8 May.</p>
<p>In a letter of 7&ndash;8 May 1826, Margaret recalls to John James the &ldquo;journey up,&rdquo; when &ldquo;both you &amp; I had repeatedly asked [James] if he was quite sure he was happy&rdquo; (<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref>, 142). Would John Ruskin have been taken on this trip? It seems unlikely that the Ruskins would have risked the exposure, when Margaret knew to warn James&rsquo;s own siblings to keep away from him &ldquo;for fear of infection&rdquo; (<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref>, 142). If John was left at home with his nurse <xref type="note" doc="note" target="strachanann">Ann Strachan</xref>, perhaps visiting his cousins in Croydon, this would perhaps have been the only time in Ruskin&rsquo;s childhood when he was separated from both parents for a substantial period.</p>
<p><xref type="note" doc="note" target="richardsonjames">James Richardson</xref>&rsquo;s journey to <xref type="note" doc="note" target="perth">Perth</xref> is assigned to April by Burd (<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref>, 134 n. 3), which must be correct since James was clearly still at <xref type="note" doc="note" target="hernehill">Herne Hill</xref> on 11 March (<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref>, 137) but had long departed by 5 May, when John James was traveling in the North, and, &ldquo;by this time,&rdquo; Margaret wrote, would have stopped in <xref type="note" doc="note" target="perth">Perth</xref> to check on his progress (<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref>, 138). Since John James must have interrupted his spring traveling for orders to take James to Scotland, the delay of business partly explains why John James resumed traveling well beyond his 10 May birthday and into June (see <xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref>, 149). On his return in June, the family probably took the holiday at the ocean beach in <xref type="note" doc="note" target="hastings">Hastings</xref> that forms the setting of parts of <xref type="works" doc="works" target="3">&ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Vol. 1</xref>.</p>
<p>Ruskin quickly became despondent over James&rsquo;s departure, his depression deepened by the protracted absence of his father, as well (&ldquo;No papa no James&rdquo; [<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref>, 141]). Alarmed by all these dangers, Margaret vowed never again to adopt a relation into the household, and soon rebuffed her own sister&rsquo;s attempts to recommend a daughter, Mary Bridget, to the Ruskins&rsquo; favor (<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref>, 144, 162).</p>
<p>At whatever point in 1826 when &ldquo;On Scotland&rdquo; was composed, the situation surrounding the poem was likely charged with grief. The poem could have been written at <xref type="note" doc="note" target="hernehill">Herne Hill</xref> in April or May, shortly following James&rsquo;s departure. It could have been written on the journey itself, in the unlikely event that John accompanied his parents and cousin to Scotland. It could have been written during or after the family&rsquo;s visit to <xref type="note" doc="note" target="perth">Perth</xref> in fall 1826, if that journey occurred (see <xref type="note" doc="note" target="tours1826-27">Tours of 1826&ndash;27</xref>). In the latter case, the permanence of James&rsquo;s loss would have been brought home to Ruskin by a visit to his cousin&rsquo;s grave.</p>

<div type="section" n="discussion">
<p>If the threat of war to &ldquo;our peaceful home&rdquo; in this poem refers to a specific conflict, the most recent was in the East: the Greek War for Independence from Turkish domination. That war might have caught Ruskin&rsquo;s imagination owing to associations with <xref type="note" doc="note" target="byron">Lord Byron</xref>, who had died in Missolonghi in 1824, although directly identifiable connections with <xref type="note" doc="note" target="byron">Byron</xref> will not appear in Ruskin&rsquo;s writing until 0000 in ???.</p>
<p>In the Greek conflict, Britain was striving to avoid an outbreak between Turkey and Russia, whose new tsar, Nicholas I, was willing to push hostilities. In October 1826, which would accord well with a probable date for Ruskin&rsquo;s poem, Britain pressured Turkey to accept Russian conditions in the Convention of Akkerman. This assured Russian influence in the Caucasus and the opening of the Straits of Bosphorus to trade, which might have interested the Ruskins&rsquo; mercantile household. As it turned out, Russia continued to press hostilities in the name of the Greek cause, and Britain joined France and Russia to declare joint mediation, according to a treaty signed in London in July 1827, but this event would certainly have occurred too late to have occasioned Ruskin&rsquo;s poem. (In the subsequent history, the Turks refused mediation but were defeated by allied fleets at Navarino in October 1827. The Treaty of Adrianople, rendering Greece autonomous, was signed two years later, in September 1829.)</p>
<p>The latest credible threat of actual invasion of British shores had ended in 1815 with the Battle of Waterloo. It is the Napoleonic Wars that captured Ruskin&rsquo;s imagination in the late 1820s, and it is possible that &ldquo;The Defiance of War&rdquo; should be grouped with such works as <xref type="works" doc="works" target="xxx">&ldquo;Battle of Waterloo: A Play in Two Acts,&rdquo;</xref> <xref type="works" doc="works" target="xxx">&ldquo;Ballad on Waterloo,&rdquo;</xref> and <xref type="works" doc="works" target="xxx">&ldquo;Trafalgar.&rdquo;</xref></p>
<p>Another, more indirect possibility is that the poem also works figuratively to comment on the illness and death of Ruskin&rsquo;s cousin, <xref type="note" doc="note" target="richardsonjames">James Richardson</xref> (see <xref type="works" doc="works" target="6#discussion">&ldquo;On Scotland&rdquo;: Discussion</xref>). If so, the poem shows how the boy&rsquo;s apparently genuine grief for his cousin was mixed with alarm over the threat he posed to the peace of the household.</p>

<div type="section" n="date">
<p>January&ndash;February or spring 1827. Possibly first half of 1826.</p>
<p>This poem, as well as <xref type="works" doc="works" target="9">&ldquo;On the Rainbow: In Blank Verse,&rdquo;</xref> which follows it, most likely belong to January 1827 or a short time afterward, possibly extending into spring. The two poems follow <xref type="note" doc="note" target="ruskinmargaret">Margaret Ruskin</xref>&rsquo;s note dating the whole of <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="1">MS I</xref> as finished &ldquo;about Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1827&rdquo; (see <xref type="works" doc="works" target="1#date">&ldquo;The Needless Alarm&rdquo;: Date</xref>). Following <xref type="works" doc="works" target="9">&ldquo;On the Rainbow: In Blank Verse,&rdquo;</xref> Ruskin wrote &ldquo;The end / hernhill / fountain street / end of the poems[strikethrough] / juvenile library fountain street.&rdquo; This colophon seems to correspond with Margaret&rsquo;s note, &ldquo;this book . . . finished,&rdquo; especially since Ruskin crossed out &ldquo;end of the poems,&rdquo; perhaps to emphasize the conclusion of the volume, not just of the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="msipoetryanthology">MS I Poetry Anthology</xref>.</p>
<p>The apparent correspondence between the colophon and Margaret&rsquo;s note nonetheless leaves an opening on the question of dating. On the one hand, one can imagine Ruskin writing the colophon before his mother entered her date for the manuscript. (She might have jotted her note where she did, between &ldquo;On Papa&rsquo;s Leaving Home&rdquo; and the preceding poem <xref type="works" doc="works" target="1">&ldquo;The Needless Alarm,&rdquo;</xref> because that was the only space available.) On the other hand, one can imagine Ruskin returning to <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="1">MS I</xref> to add two more poems along with the colophon, after his mother had notated the booklet as being finished. If the latter is the case, then Ruskin may have composed &ldquo;On Papa&rsquo;s Leaving Home&rdquo; around 21 February 1827, when <xref type="note" doc="note" target="ruskinjohnjames">John James Ruskin</xref> sent a letter as despondent as his son&rsquo;s poem with homesickness (<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref>, 151&ndash;52)&mdash;or he might have done so later in the spring. Beyond that time, however, he was working on a new <xref type="note" doc="note" target="redbook">Red Book</xref>, <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref>, and it seems likely he would have completed <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="1">MS I</xref> before starting the new project, which is associated with the family&rsquo;s summer/fall 1827 travels.</p>
<p>An earlier date for &ldquo;On Papa&rsquo;s Leaving Home,&rdquo; of early 1826, is possible for the same reason that all the poems in the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="msipoetryanthology">MS I Poetry Anthology</xref> could predate their fair copying (see <xref type="works" doc="works" target="1#date">&ldquo;The Needless Alarm&rdquo;: Date</xref>). If so, then this poem in particular might be read as expressing regret over <xref type="note" doc="note" target="ruskinjohnjames">John James Ruskin</xref>&rsquo;s protracted absence during the first half of 1826 (see <xref type="works" doc="works" target="2#date">&ldquo;Glen of Glenfarg&rdquo; (&ldquo;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&rdquo;): Date</xref>). If &ldquo;On Papa&rsquo;s Leaving Home&rdquo; and <xref type="works" doc="works" target="9">&ldquo;On the Rainbow: In Blank Verse&rdquo;</xref> were fair-copied in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="1">MS I</xref> at about the same time, however, the case for 1827 is strengthened by the latter&rsquo;s sharing a subtitle with <xref type="works" doc="works" target="4">&ldquo;Time: Blank Verse.&rdquo;</xref></p>

<p>The family letters contain frequent references to John James bringing or sending presents home from his business travels&mdash;for example, a book, possibly a <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe,</hi> the costliness of which Margaret impressed on her son in May 1826 (<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref>, 146, and see 149).</p>
<p>By rhyming &ldquo;pictures and presents&rdquo; with &ldquo;peasants,&rdquo; Ruskin perhaps refers to the subject of pictures that John James may have brought home&mdash;engravings of peasants, for example, in colorful costumes in lands that genre painters were visiting in the 1820s. . . . (When does Wilkie go to Spain? When is JJR&rsquo;s first note of purchasing an annual?)</p>
<p>That the poem ends by focusing more on the despondency of Papa rather than the longing of the boy for his father may refer to John James&rsquo;s &ldquo;sombre evenings&rdquo; when he was away, times when wrote to Margaret about &ldquo;a real sadness &amp; sigh[ing] like a child after the Joys of my home&rdquo; (9 March 1826 [<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref>, 134]). In 1826, John James was particularly prone to depression over slow business and the consequent necessity for protracted travel for orders. At home, owing to his long absences, &ldquo;every thing&rdquo; was &ldquo;unsettled and uncomfortable&rdquo;; and painful longing afflicted even the servants, much less Margaret and John (25 May 1826 [<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref>, 148]).</p>
<p>John James was depressed also over the death of his nephew, <xref type="note" doc="note" target="richardsonjames">James Richardson</xref>, whom he had employed in his firm, and he was troubled by guilt that his stewardship might even have had something &ldquo;to do with this disorder&rdquo; (8 May 1826 [<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref>, 140]). In fact, if Ruskin composed this poem as late as April&ndash;May 1826, its tone may refer specifically both to his father&rsquo;s solemn letters and to his own &ldquo;forsaken&rdquo; feeling of &ldquo;No papa no James&rdquo; (7 May 1826 [<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref>, 141]).</p>

<p>Ruskin&rsquo;s pun in the repeated word <hi rend="italic">reflect,</hi> meaning both <hi rend="italic">contemplate</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mirror,</hi> becomes evident when the poem&rsquo;s source is identified not only in Genesis (chap?) but also in a scientific work, such as Joyce, <hi rend="italic">Dialogues</hi>, in which the rainbow is explained as a phenomenon of light reflection and refraction (Conversation 18, &ldquo;Of the Rainbow&rdquo; [3:94&ndash;100]).</p>
<p>The poem is possibly linked to two drawings in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="1">MS I</xref>. &ldquo;Frontispiece&rdquo; [Plate] &ldquo;1&rdquo; [&ldquo;Harry and Lucy&rdquo; Vol 1] crudely depicts a rainbow (helpfully labeled as such, resembling as it does an outline of a hill) in a rainy sky, from which the sun has emerged. Since the frontispiece takes up an entire page, facing the title page of the volume, no evidence definitely precludes its having been drawn at the same time that &ldquo;On the Rainbow: In Blank Verse&rdquo; was entered at the back. It is more likely, however, that the poem was written later in 1827, to complement the frontispiece from fall 1826, since the frontispiece also serves as a part-title page for &ldquo;Harry and Lucy&rdquo; (begun September or October 1826). Also, in level of skill, the drawing exhibits Ruskin&rsquo;s earlier tendency to line up objects on a single plane, a feature that is replaced by more complex perspectives in the course of the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="redbook">Red Book</xref> (see <xref type="works" doc="works" target="3#discussion">&ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Vol. 1: Discussion</xref>).</p>
<p>A second drawing, <xref type="drawings" doc="drawings" target="12">&ldquo;Heights of Wisdom, Depth of Fools&rdquo; [Miscellaneous Drawing, MS I]</xref>, which concludes the volume on the back endboard, represents an allegorical scene of the &ldquo;heights of wisdom&rdquo; and &ldquo;depths of folly.&rdquo; Wisdom and folly might describe those who, according to this poem, reflect or fail to reflect, respectively, on the sign of God&rsquo;s covenant.

<div type="section" n="discussion">
<p>The penciled hand in MS IVA is similar to that in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="1">MS I</xref>, which contains the earliest reference to Latin, Ruskin&rsquo;s Harry having to interrupt his play to attend to lessons (<xref type="works" doc="works" target="3">&ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Vol. 1</xref>, chap. 2). The next dateable references to Latin lessons occur in 1828 and 1829, when Ruskin is translating Virgil&rsquo;s fourth pastoral and the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> (<xref type="works" doc="works" target="xxx">&ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Vol. 3</xref>; and <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">MS II</xref>)&mdash;the former for his father, and the latter for his tutor. The more rudimentary exercises in MS IVA must have been drawn from Adams&rsquo;s Latin grammar, the &ldquo;Scotch thing&rdquo; that his later tutor Reverend Dale contemptuously dismissed (<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="jrworksle">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></xref>, 35:83).</p>
<p>Viljoen&rsquo;s colleague, Professor Gries (<xref type="internal" doc="internal" target="DATE">see Date</xref>), however, remarked that, &ldquo;these exercises look like notes on what he had been told, together with attempts to write up his own models and create, so to speak, his own grammar. This is of course a sensible way of learning Latin, or any language. The contents on the other hand indicate the old-fashioned and nonsensical grammar-analysis approach to language.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The MS XI version is a presentation copy . . . (?). The <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref> version, entitled &ldquo;THE SHIP&rdquo; and with &ldquo;Look at that ship&rdquo; forming its first line, immediately follows poems dated 1 January 1828.</p>
<p><xref type="works" doc="works" target="xxx">&ldquo;The Ship&rdquo; [1828&ndash;29]</xref>, which is likewise contained in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref> (as part of the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="msiiipoetryanthology3">MS III Third Poetry Anthology</xref>) might also be included here as a later version of the 1827 poem. Beyond the first three lines, however, the 1828&ndash;29 poem differs so substantially that it can be treated as a separate work. In the later poem, Ruskin&rsquo;s intentions have shifted toward expressing a patriotism that is wholly absent from the earlier work, and that considerably expand the length and rhetorical range of the poem. At the same time, some rhetorical features remain present in the later work, if not identically expressed, such as Ruskin&rsquo;s interest in relevant sizes and distances. The 1827 and 1828&ndash;29 pieces raise an interesting case for probing the distinction between <hi rend="italic">work</hi> and <hi rend="italic">version,</hi> and it is quite possible to see 1828&ndash;29 as part of the unfolding intentions of one version to another, in a very open-ended conception of a single work called &ldquo;The Ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruskin copied &ldquo;Wales&rdquo; and <xref type="works" doc="works" target="13">&ldquo;Spring: Blank Verse&rdquo;</xref> into a letter to his father of May 1827, presumably to show them off as recent compositions. This date thus provides a lower limit for the poems&rsquo; fair copies among the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="poetrydiscriptive">Poetry Descriptive</xref> in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref>, in which these two poems are placed between <xref type="works" doc="works" target="16">&ldquo;Nature&rdquo;</xref> and <xref type="works" doc="works" target="17">&ldquo;The Hill of Kinnoul&rdquo;</xref> (and in reverse order from their appearance in the letter&mdash;that is, first <xref type="works" doc="works" target="13">&ldquo;Spring: Blank Verse&rdquo;</xref> and then &ldquo;Wales&rdquo;).</p>
<p>In the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="libraryedition">Library Edition</xref>, the editors attribute the entire group <xref type="note" doc="note" target="poetrydiscriptive">Poetry Descriptive</xref> to an earlier date assigned to just one of its poems, <xref type="works" doc="works" target="2">&ldquo;Glen of Glenfarg&rdquo; (&ldquo;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&rdquo;)</xref>, but the group&rsquo;s earliest possible date (in their <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref> versions, at any rate) is established by Ruskin&rsquo;s May 1827 letter. Moreover, Ruskin printed the group in ink, which he first used in late April 1827 (see <xref type="note" doc="note" target="ruskinshand">Ruskin&rsquo;s Hand</xref>).</p>

<p>The earliest definite references to a Welsh journey by the Ruskins are later than this poem&mdash;one, later in 1827 when the family visited the Wye Valley and saw Tintern Abbey and Raglan Castle (see <xref type="works" doc="works" target="14">&ldquo;Ragland Castle&rdquo;</xref>; <xref type="works" doc="works" target="20">&ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Vol. 2</xref>), and a much later journey in 1831 (<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref>, 220). The poem is probably looking forward to the upcoming journey to the Wye Valley, or it might look back on Lake District tours that could have included portions of Wales (see <xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Tour to the Lakes</hi></xref> 6&ndash;7)&mdash;or both. The poem&rsquo;s reference to &ldquo;whitened land&rdquo; may suggest a winter journey.</p>
<p>The poem probably glances both ways, since, in spring 1827, the entire family would have been afflicted with wanderlust and looking forward to a Wales and Scotland tour. That year, like 1826, was a toilsome one, and, in spite of <xref type="note" doc="note" target="ruskinjohnjames">John James Ruskin</xref>&rsquo;s anticipation of &ldquo;Spring &amp; Summer for new pleasures,&rdquo; he was traveling for orders until after his birthday, possibly as late as June (<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></xref>, 152, 167). In addition, Margaret had been ill all that spring and could not travel.</p>

<p>The main difference between the two versions, which would have caused Ruskin or perhaps his parents to deem version <hi rend="italic">a</hi> as &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; is the violence of the woman&rsquo;s death. In other very early work, there is evidence of avoiding violence.

<p>THE REST of the noon was so foggy that Harry could not see more than four yards before him. But he amused himself with drawing the rest of the noon and took dinner.</p>
<p>After dinner Harry had to learn his lessons because the electrical phenomenon had quite driven them out of his head<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn1">1</xref></hi>  But he learned them so quickly that he had from three to nine to play but he did not play he spent from three to half past it in learning his lessons for tomorrow and spent the rest in drawing took tea and went to bed.</p>
<p>Next morning a strange adventure befel Harry. As he was walking upon the beach<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn2">2</xref></hi> with Lucy he called out here&rsquo;s a fine place of shell&rsquo;s for you and he heard you you you you you repeated five times and on looking about found a hollow in the rock and saw that it was an echo[&mdash;]&rsquo;</p>
<p>But on going home he found them packing up for off for they had staid a week in Hastings&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry said he was sorry to leave it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But we must leave it said his mother&rsquo;</p>
<p>Why must we mother.</p>
<p>Because we have not time to stay longer in it[&mdash;]</p>
<p>Where are we going next mother</p>
<p>To scotland Harry.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn3">3</xref></hi></p>
<p>To scotland what a long travel but I like it the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I can tell you you&rsquo;ll be very sleepy and tired by the way</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care for that said Harry</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ll see such frightfull precipices[&mdash;]</p>
<p>So much the better said Harry</p>
<p>But by this time the carriage had got to the door and all getting in drove off[&mdash;]&rdquo;</p>
<p>First they came to a common public road with hedges on each side of it till at last they came to a beautiful road sometimes hedges sometimes none at all sometimes landscapes sometimes none at all hills hillocks mounts rivulets rivers ponds lakes all in profusion sometimes high on a hill sometimes low in a valley and all along the same<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn4">4</xref></hi></p>
<p>Harry and Lucys mother had a certain friend living near this place and they went to see him here they saw many pretty and useful flowers such as the mimosa the papyrus and the coffee tree<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn5">5</xref></hi> and after having had a good run they got into the carriage and drove into salt hill[&mdash;]<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn6">6</xref></hi></p>
<p>But here they stayed only to dinner or else Harry would have had a fine swing there being a nice one in the ground  But such little disappointments must be put up with and they went on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after this they came to the seme<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn7">7</xref></hi> road again and after riding on for a very very very long time and changing horses often they reached oxford[&mdash;]</p>
<p>But it was so very late when they arrived at oxford that they could not see any thing but they were told that they were to stay all night at the hotel and in the morning went to see the colleges. They might have seen the inside if they had time but they had not so that they only went round them looked at their architecture and went home[&mdash;]&rdquo;<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn8">8</xref></hi></p>
<p>Their father and mother thought very much of it but they had not much time to think about it for harry asked what the distance might be from gloster<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn9">9</xref></hi> which he was told they were going to next  his father told him that he did not know and new<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn10">10</xref></hi> the carriage drove to the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But just as they were passing a fine elm they saw a large pond perhaps a mile broad going <hi rend="italic">completly</hi><hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn11">11</xref></hi> across the road without any bridge and the horses plunged into it  whats this cried Harry  Where are we going now cried Lucy they went on on deeper and deeper into the water and at length they went completely through the pond and went forward on their journey[&mdash;]&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time the road was very hilly chalky sandy and watery but soon it grew very dusty and such a fine day that they all got out and walked a good way they had intended to walk very quick but they did not for they were attracted by such a variety of objects such as the white major convolvolus in the hedges the black and white broad beans the butterfly like pea&rsquo;s<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn12">12</xref></hi> the sparkling rivulets and winding rivers all combined their forces to make them walk slowly  But on turning a corner such a beautiful waterfall presented itself to their view that they stood for above four minutes looking at it and harry just as he turned to look at the glittering diamond like bubbles in the stream he saw something leap up the waterfall and on looking at it he saw that it was a salmon the time passed so very quickly in looking at the waterfall that when harrys father looked at his watch they had been an hour looking at it  when they again got into the carriage harry said that if lucy liked he would give her a drawing of charles&rsquo;s wain as an introduction to astronomy.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn13">13</xref></hi> Lucy said she would like it very much and we shall here put it down.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn14">14</xref></hi></p>
<p>Though Lucy liked astronomy very much yet she asked harry why he did not go on with pneumatics.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn15">15</xref></hi> Scarcely was this said than they found themselves at the inn and such was the bustle occasioned by packing and unpacking that harry could not answer Lucys question.</p>
<p>There was very little to be seen at glocester and so they only staid to dine. There was also nothing remarkable in their ride.</p>
<p>When they got to monmouth<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn16">16</xref></hi> harry went out for a walk with his father  they went by the side of the river Wye which was rather full of projecting banks and peninsulas at that place and they staid so long that when they got home they found tea was waiting for them and after tea there was much much deliberation about going to tintern abbey next day  harrys mother was against going to it harrys father was for going to it at length mamma yielded and they went to tintern abbey next day.</p>
<p>CHAP II</p>
<p>W<hi rend="smallcaps">hen</hi> they had reached the place where tintern abbey was to be seen they got out and walked to it<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn17">17</xref></hi>  in so doing they saw some beehives and scarcely had harry turned round from looking at them than he saw tintern abbey. It had a most beautiful window for first there was an arch and then by its sides and top there were all kinds of figures. The door was in this shape [diagram] and when their guide had opened it they found themselves in a large abbey with two rows of pillars one on each side of them but broken and ruined. Their guide showed them some keystones of the arches that had fallen down and harry wondered why the arches did not fall with them  He looked up and saw no gap in the arch and he asked his father what was the reason of all this but his father was busy looking at other things and so Harry was obliged to go to the same ones. After looking for a good while at these Harry and Lucy began to get tired but soon their guide took them through a passage which led them past several ruined rooms. Going through one of these they found themselves on a little green with a hillock [diagram?] on one side of it  from the green nothing was seen but a stone wall but when harry ascended the hillock no view could be more beautiful  they then went out of the abbey and went on to windcliff<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn18">18</xref></hi> having gone through a cottage they saw a high rock as perpendicular as the wall of a house full of crags and white  harry was rather puzzled when he was told that he was to climb up this rock but the man who led them carried them by gentle sloping walks which carried them up to the top of the rock without the least difficulty</p>
<p>They thought that the coming down would not be so easy but it was much easier because it was a gentle slope  when they were safe down they jumped into the carriage and drove off</p>
<p>In a few minutes they saw the sea and presently they came to the side of it  they were presently aboard a steamboat and soon they arrived at the other side<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn19">19</xref></hi> they then jumped into the carriage and drove off  they soon arrived at kinross<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn20">20</xref></hi> here they took tea and drove off to Perth  Harry and Lucy were so sleepy that they were forced to go to bed whenever they arrived in Perth  their house chanced to be directly opposite the tay with the north inch completely between them and the tay<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn21">21</xref></hi>  so when they arose in the morning they thought they would like to go out and take a walk and Harry took his little boat with him thinking it would take a nice sail in the tay but he was disappointed for the tay was so rough that his vessel immediately turned topsy turvy  seeing that to sail his vessel was impossible he took a nice walk with Lucy[,] and then returned home. They had seen some fine ups and downs on the inch so they thought they would hav<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn22">22</xref></hi> some play on them  Harry then determined to give Lucy a lesson of science so he thought he would show her this experiment.</p>
<p>Harry then took an ale glass[,]<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn23">23</xref></hi> and plunged it with the mouth downwards into a jar of water and very little water entered into it.</p>
<p>Lucy enquired the reason of this and harry said that the air in the glass was compressed into the smaller space and would not let the water come in farther<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn24">24</xref></hi></p>
<p>chap III</p>
<p>HARRYS mother now said to him that it was time to go out so Harry and Lucy put on their things and went out upon the inch they went to the ups and downs which they had seen the last time they were out  and first of all Harry first proposed running up and down the upandowns but lucy proposed breaking spars which harry agreed to and they got many beautiful spars by lucys plan when they came home they showed their spars to their mother who said that there were some different metals in them which Harry and Lucy were very well pleased at.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn25">25</xref></hi>  it was now dinner time and after dinner Harry drew till teatime then wrote a letter for his mother an went to bed.</p>
<p>This was the second day they had been at perth and on the morrow they were to march off</p>
<p>When harry arose in the morning he found all busy with packing and soon they jumped into the carriage and drove off to kinross</p>
<p>Here Harry went out to see the lake of lochleven<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn26">26</xref></hi> and when he came in his shoes were thoroughly wet through he had been so near the lake  he now drew a copy of a church that was close to the inn where they were and then got into the carriage and drove off to Queens ferry.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn27">27</xref></hi></p>
<p>While crossing the water the steamboat pitched so that harry could hardly keep upon his legs but when harry got to edinburgh<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn28">28</xref></hi> he had such a comfortable room comfortable dinner and comfortable tea that he quite forgot all pitching and travelling.</p>
<p>Whenever harry got up in the morning he went out to the top of the carlton hill<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn29">29</xref></hi> with his papa and when he came in he found the carriage waiting for him into which he jumped and in a few minutes they came in sight of the sea  they travelled by the sea a long while and then going away from it they came to haddington where harry expected to see the sea very well</p>
<p>But when harry came to haddington they saw nothing but a long street which rather disappointed harry<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn30">30</xref></hi> but when they came to berwick they saw the sea finely<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn31">31</xref></hi></p>
<p>In the morning harry went out on the walls with his father and when he came in jumped into the carriage and drove off to alnwick here harry went with his father to see the castle<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn32">32</xref></hi> and then drove off to newcastle<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn33">33</xref></hi>  it here began snowing very fast so that harry could not get out nor could Lucy for if they had gone out they would have tumbled every five minutes but when they set off they soon got to durham<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn34">34</xref></hi> where they changed horses and went on to darlington<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn35">35</xref></hi> here they slept and in the morning went on to boroughbridge.  the reason it was called so was that a very beautiful bridge was in the town<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn36">36</xref></hi> the room which they had got had a bookcase in it and harry met with his favourite history of sandford and merton<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn37">37</xref></hi> which he had not finished before he was forced to go on to ferrybridge which he was rather sorry for but it was made up at ferrybridge for there they had a complete view of the river which flowed through the town.<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn38">38</xref></hi></p>
<p>Here they slept and in the morning went off for doncaster this was a beautiful town there was an avenue of trees through which they passed to go into the town  well from this avenue the high towers of the cathedral gilded by the rays of the sun and the mountains at a distance looked so beautiful that people must see it to comprehend it<hi rend="superscript"><xref type="note" doc="note" target="works20c0fn39">39</xref></hi> even the great bass with its multitudes of seafowl could not equal this and what made the bass the more charming was that the bass was seen at sunset while this was seen at noon  But I will put them on to scarthing moor in another chapter.</p>

<p>It is possible that the second volume repeats a compositional pattern established in <xref type="works" doc="works" target="3">&ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Vol. 1</xref>. Ruskin may have begun volume 1 of &ldquo;Harry and Lucy&rdquo; during a family journey, in autumn 1826, to Scotland, and finished this opening portion of the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="redbook">Red Book</xref> (along with the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="msipoetryanthology">MS I Poetry Anthology</xref>) at home around New Year&rsquo;s in 1827 (see <xref type="note" doc="note" target="tours1826-27">Tours of 1826&ndash;27</xref>). Just so, he may have begun volume 2 during an autumn 1827 Wales and Scotland journey and finished it (along with <xref type="note" doc="note" target="poetrydiscriptive">Poetry Descriptive</xref> and possibly the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="msiiipoetryanthology2">MS III Second Poetry Anthology</xref>) around New Year&rsquo;s 1828.</p>
<p>Before completing &ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; vol. 2, Ruskin skipped several pages, leaving room for expansion of the narrative, and entered the anthology, <xref type="note" doc="note" target="poetrydiscriptive">Poetry Descriptive</xref>, which contains poems related to the sights, such as <xref type="works" doc="works" target="12">&ldquo;Wales&rdquo;</xref> and <xref type="works" doc="works" target="14">&ldquo;Ragland Castle&rdquo;</xref> (that is, Raglan); <xref type="works" doc="works" target="15">&ldquo;Lochleven&rdquo;</xref> and <xref type="works" doc="works" target="17">&ldquo;The Hill of Kinnoul.&rdquo;</xref> This anthology may have been finished before he entered the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="msiiipoetryanthology2">MS III Second Poetry Anthology</xref> at home, around New Year&rsquo;s 1828, including the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="newyearspoems">New Year&rsquo;s Poems</xref> <xref type="works" doc="works" target="4">&ldquo;Time: Blank Verse&rdquo;</xref> (from the previous New Year&rsquo;s) and <xref type="works" doc="works" target="22">&ldquo;The Sun.&rdquo;</xref></p>
</div>
<div type="section" n="discussion">
<head type="subheading">Travel</head>
<p>The narrative dovetails with that of <xref type="works" doc="works" target="3">&ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Vol. 1</xref>, by starting with Harry and Lucy at the seaside in <xref type="note" doc="note" target="hastings">Hastings</xref>, where they had progressed at the end of volume 1. Very shortly, Harry&rsquo;s Mama announces their departure for Scotland, although the family travels first to the Wye Valley, via Oxford and Gloucester.</p>
<p>Like the seaside holiday in volume 1, the Wales and Scotland journeys of volume 2 may well have been based on actual tours of 1826 and/or 1827. Of course, fictional dovetailing notwithstanding, the Ruskins surely would not have set out directly for Scotland from the Sussex coast. One might question even whether they took in Wales and eastern Scotland in the same trip. In volume 2, those itineraries are connected by a steamboat crossing that is either pure fantasy for the sake of keeping Harry and Lucy on the road or the record of an actual crossing used here to link one point to the other. That the Wales and eastern Scotland tours were connected does gain support, however, from the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="poetrydiscriptive">Poetry Descriptive</xref> anthology, which is also contained in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref> and probably was early as &ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Vol. 2, and which includes topographical verse relating both to Wales and Scotland. It is possible also that the itineraries were joined by a visit to the Lakes, which scholars have assumed to have occurred in 1826, but which may actually have occurred in 1827 (see Tours 1826&ndash;27).</p>
<p>In volume 2 of &ldquo;Harry and Lucy&rdquo; itself, the itinerary takes the family east through Oxford, and Gloucester; to the Wye Valley for Monmouth, Tintern Abbey, Wyndcliff; to Scotland for Kinross, Loch Leven, and <xref type="note" doc="note" target="perth">Perth</xref>; returning south to cross at Queensferry for Edinburgh; and south along the coast to Haddington, Berwick, Alnwick, Newcastle, Durham, Darlington and nearby Boroughbridge and Ferrybridge; inland toward Doncaster; and there the narrative is sliced off, with the remark, &ldquo;But I will put them on to scarthing moor [near Newark-on-Trent] in another chapter&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The <xref type="note" doc="note" target="perth">Perth</xref> episode includes Harry trying to sail a toy boat on the Tay, which proves too rough; running with Lucy on the Inch, along the &ldquo;fine ups and downs&rdquo;; and continuing with Edgeworthian activities, such as physics experiments (probably imagined) and geology (perhaps actual, the breaking of spars). At Boroughbridge, Harry was able to borrow &ldquo;his favourite history of sandford and merton,&rdquo; the only direct mention of Thomas Day&rsquo;s Rousseauist tale in the juvenilia.</p>
<p>Harry says the family had to &ldquo;march off&rdquo; from <xref type="note" doc="note" target="perth">Perth</xref> on the third day of their visit. If this was actually true, the family&rsquo;s visit may have been cut short by the elder Ruskins&rsquo; lingering fears of tuberculosis, to which Ruskin&rsquo;s cousin James had succumbed in the spring of 1826 (see <xref type="works" doc="works" target="6">&ldquo;On Scotland&rdquo;</xref>). Also, another cousin, the eight-year-old Janet, or &ldquo;Jessie,&rdquo; is traditionally believed to have died in 1827 (<xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="jrworksle">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></xref> 35:70), although it is unclear precisely when or of what cause (see <xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="xxx">Viljoen, <hi rend="italic">Ruskin&rsquo;s Scottish Heritage</hi></xref>, 182, 184, and no. 89). That Ruskin would have been keenly aware of these mortal illnesses adds poignancy to certain details in the narrative: for example, a possible identification of Lucy with cousin Jessie, or Harry&rsquo;s lingering on the return trip over <hi rend="italic">Sandford and Merton</hi>, a story of boyhood companionship. But the poignancy may arise only in our hindsight. If an awareness of death is in the text, Ruskin seems to have kept the issue at bay in the narrative. See, however, <xref type="note" doc="note" target="poetrydiscriptive">Poetry Descriptive</xref>, in which some poems may reflect an elegiac feeling.</p>

<div type="section" n="date">
<p>Late 1827 to January 1828.</p>
<p>The fair copy in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref> is undated, but its placement immediately following <xref type="works" doc="works" target="20">&ldquo;Harry and Lucy,&rdquo; Vol. 2</xref>, and before <xref type="works" doc="works" target="22">&ldquo;The Sun&rdquo;</xref> suggests New Year&rsquo;s 1828. Thus, the editors of the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="libraryedition">Library Edition</xref> are strictly correct in listing the poem under 1827&mdash;that is, composition in late 1827 for a New Year&rsquo;s 1828 presentation. However, the editors seem to intend earlier 1827, associating the poem with the rough draft of <xref type="works" doc="works" target="xxx">&ldquo;The Monastery&rdquo;</xref> in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">MS IA</xref> (which they misdate as 1827). If they based their dating on harder evidence contained in the rough draft of &ldquo;The Constellations&rdquo; in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">MS IA</xref> (see <xref type="biblio" doc="biblio" target="jrworksle">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></xref>, 2:535), their reasoning cannot be confirmed or denied, since a piece of that rough draft manuscript is now very likely missing (see <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">MS IA: </xref>Contents, <hi rend="italic">b</hi>).</p>
<p>The evidence in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref> does hold open a possibility for an earlier date. As noted in <xref type="works" doc="works" target="1#discussion">&ldquo;The Needless Alarm&rdquo;: Discussion</xref>, and <xref type="works" doc="works" target="4#discussion">&ldquo;Time: Blank Verse&rdquo;: Discussion</xref>, Ruskin tended to include his previous year&rsquo;s <xref type="note" doc="note" target="newyearspoems">New Year&rsquo;s Poem</xref> along with the most recent New Year&rsquo;s presentation poem in the anthologies following &ldquo;Harry and Lucy.&rdquo; Thus, &ldquo;The Constellations&rdquo; could have existed in a version as a New Year&rsquo;s gift for 1827, which Ruskin copied here. Given the evidence in Composition and Publication, however, a likelier scenario has Ruskin preparing a fair copy (<xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">RF T70</xref>) for presentation on 1 January 1828 (not 1827)&mdash;a copy that either he did complete and present, but then retracted for to revise for <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref>, or that he sacrificed to revision before presentation and fair-copied the results in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref>.</p>

<p>Quoted in Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> 2:260 n. 1. Previously unpublished in entirety.</p>
<p>The <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">MS IA</xref> version appears to be the earliest, a partial pencil draft, which starts with line 27 of the poem. (For possible records of a now missing sheet of this draft, containing the opening 26 lines, see <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">MS IA: </xref>Contents, <hi rend="italic">b</hi>.) This draft provided the basis for a fair copy in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">RF T70</xref>, which follows <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">MS IA</xref> closely, but which notably omits, at line 64, <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">MS IA</xref>&rsquo;s &ldquo;I end end.&rdquo; Since even <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">MS IA</xref> continues its draft beyond this declaration, Ruskin clearly changed his mind in mid-draft about concluding the poem, and therefore he omitted this line when fair-copying for <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">RF T70</xref>.</p>
<p>The <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">RF T70</xref> version in turn formed the basis for the <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref> version. <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">RF T70</xref> itself is a photograph, taken for the <xref type="note" doc="note" target="libraryedition">Library Edition</xref> but unused, of a manuscript whose whereabouts is now unknown (see also <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">MS IA: </xref>Contents, <hi rend="italic">b</hi>). There appear to be at least three stages of composition reflected in the manuscript.</p>
<p>First, the photograph shows a neatly printed, ink fair copy, which runs the full length of the poem, adhering to the text of <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">MS IA</xref> at least from line 27, the first line currently extant. This fair copy, moreover, improves the draft in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">MS IA</xref> by capitalizing first letters of each line (and capitalizing the entire first word of line 1); by punctiliously punctuating the end of each line, through line 19 (after which end-line punctuation is dropped); and by inserting marginal line numbering at the left of the text.</p>
<p>Next, the fair copy was used for revision, which appears to be represented in two stages, first apparently in pencil and second in ink. Because the photograph can show only relative darkness and texture of these insertions, the two stages cannot always be definitively distinguished. It is unquestionable, however, that the photograph shows a palimpsest since, in places, a dark ink hand overwrites a much lighter hand, and under magnification the lighter hand shows the variable texture of pencil stroke, and the darker hand the evenness of ink.</p>
<p>Apparently in the first stage of this revision, someone using the lighter hand marked the ends of lines with a short diagonal line (/), sometimes with a double diagonal (//), but marked other lines with a cross (X), and the latter show cancellations and insertions&mdash;in the form of strikethrough and caret, within the line; in the form of longhand insertion, in the margin. (Minor variations occur in this pattern.) Presumably, the lines with Xs were flagged for revision, but by whom, and whether by the same person who simultaneously or subsequently wrote the insertion, one can only guess. On the whole, the marginal insertions appear to be in pencil, the same color and texture as the diagonals and Xs. The second stage of revision, insofar as it can be distinguished from the first, appears to be represented by the ink overwriting. But the two stages may be only apparent, and the actual sequence more complex.</p>
<p>The longhand in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">RF T70</xref> is somewhat awkward, in keeping with the fact documented in family letters that Ruskin had only recently started practicing longhand as well as the use of ink (see <xref type="note" doc="note" target="ruskinshand">Ruskin&rsquo;s Hand</xref>). It is possible, however, that more than one hand is represented in the revisions.</p>
<p>There appear to be several possible reasons why the fair copy shown in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">RF T70</xref> was sacrificed to revision. Ruskin may have felt that the fair-copy was spoiled by the error in line 54, which he ended with <hi rend="italic">appear,</hi> thus repeating the rhyme word at the end of the previous line, in place of <hi rend="italic">bear,</hi> which ends line 54 in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">MS IA</xref>, and to which he returned in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref>. Moreover, about the same place, starting with with line 53 in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">RF T70</xref>, the printing becomes noticeably larger, as if he was suddenly in a hurry. Perhaps most importantly, two significant confusions arise in the sense of the text at about this point.</p>
<p>First, the pair of couplets starting at line 57 about the Scales and the Milky Way, which made little sense in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">MS IA</xref>, made even less sense in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">RF T70</xref>; and hence, lines 57&ndash;60 of <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">RF T70</xref> are heavily scored through (and after line 60, Ruskin also stopped marginally numbering the lines). First, it appears, Ruskin revised the first of these couplets, concerning the scales, to arriving at the <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref> version (&ldquo;The scales in which twas vainly said / The crimes and virtues of men were weighed&rdquo; [lines 57&ndash;58]). Draft for these lines appear in ink draft at the bottom of this sheet, overwriting an earlier, canceled pencil version (that earlier version apparently still related the Scales to the Milky Way, but the lines are largely illegible in the photograph).</p>
<p>Then, in place of lines 59&ndash;60 of <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">RF T70</xref>, concerning the Milky Way, Ruskin composed five new lines and inserted them as lines 65&ndash;69 of <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref>. The draft, which is worked out on both sides of the sheet (including what would have been the blank p. 4 of the <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">RF T70</xref> folded fair copy), exhibits some tension between an Evangelical assessment of pagan myths and the classical lines that won out in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref>. On p. 4, the underwriting in pencil reads, &ldquo;[to(?)] heaven but / not [to(?)] hell [for when (?)] / they went to / place [I(?)] say [that then (?)] / they took quite / a different way / and this is all that Ive to say about the beauty [(?)] milky way.&rdquo; Overwriting this are lines approximating, but not identical to the <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref> version: &ldquo;which all their best and bravest trod / of heroes that their countrys good / espoused and neer in angry mood / unto great jupiters blest abode.&rsquo; The final version, in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref>, takes a middle way between the Christian piety of the pencil draft and the classical patriotism of the ink draft: &ldquo;But oh that wonder of them all / Which milky way europeans call / And which the ancients thought the road / Which all their best and bravest trod / Unto great Jupiters blest abode.&rdquo; (The first three lines of this version are worked out in ink draft on p. 3 [inside spread, recto] of <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">RF T70</xref>, &ldquo;but oh that wonder of them all / which milky way europeans call / and which the ancients thought the road.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Another confusion toward the end of the <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">RF T70</xref> fair copy (line 64, or line 62 in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="3">MS III</xref>), which may have contributed to Ruskin&rsquo;s giving up this fair copy to revision, arose evidently from a muddle over the order of the constellations, which failed to conform with the linear order of his <xref type="note" doc="note" target="catalog">catalog poem</xref>. Line 64 in the earlier version, &ldquo;I wish I had not observed the lyre,&rdquo; harkened back to line 17, &ldquo;After that doth come the lyre.&rdquo; At both these points in <xref type="mss" doc="mss" target="xxx">RF T70</xref>, a revision about the &ldquo;frightened hare&rdquo; is entered in the margin, which ultimately replaced line 17.</p>
<p>The hand for these changes indicate a growing hurry and restlessness. As suggested in Date, the evidence may point to hurried preparations for New Year&rsquo;s.</p>

<lg>
<l>Thou sun thou golden sun in beauty rise</l>
<l>And show thy yellow face among the clouds</l>
<l>Disperse the stars and make bright morning come</l>
<l>Break through the clouds and let thy golden beams</l>
<l>Shine on the earth. The birds arising sing</l>
<l>To hail the approach of thee. At the hot noon</l>
<l>Oft have I worked to make my garden nice</l>
<l>Till when I stopped the drops of perspiration</l>
<l>Fell from my brows. In the sweet afternoon</l>
<l>The air is balmy in that pleasant time</l>
<l>Oft have I walked with dear mamma beside me</l>
<l>To watch the flowers growing and to play</l>
<l>Upon the green. Then comes the evening dark</l>
<l>In which all nature quiet still remains</l>
<l>When seven of these are past a week is gone</l>
<l>And four of these a month doth constitute</l>
<l>And twelve of these the long long year doth make</l>
<l>But yet not all the year doth pass without</l>
<l>Some festivals and some of these i&rsquo;ll name</l>
<l>First solemn easter comes then whitsunday</l>
<l>Then christmas newyears day</l>
<l>And newyears day it is therefore papa</l>
<l>I must wish you a happy newyears day</l>
<l>And now a little description of the sun</l>
<l>The sun when first he rises is so bright</l>
<l>That nobody on him can look for if they did</l>
<l>Struck by his brightness blind they would be made</l>
<l>In the hot noon invisible he is</l>
<l>Save by the brightness round him to the eye</l>
<l>In Afternoon golden and silvery is he</l>
<l>And in dark evening he is not to be seen</l>
<l>Though his attendants are the moon comes first</l>
<l>Then evening star orion and the plough</l>
<l>Then great bear lesser and the northern crown</l>
<l>And having named these I end this poem</l>
