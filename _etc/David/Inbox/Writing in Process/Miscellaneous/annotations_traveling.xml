                <p>On traveling children: In Vulgar Children who are untutor d by fashion or art 
                    and are fretted one hour and petted another 
                    the Mind of these Victims of vehement passion soon becomes actually disordered and expresses itself 
                    accordingly nothing is more uncommon than to hear them Talk instead of asking gently they Hollow and Shout with importunate fury 
                    for what they wish to have and scream and cry as violently to avoid what they dislike and are ever and aye either in an Agony or n Ecstacy (1:20)</p>
                
                <p>On pocket maps: A Traveller should procure some previous to his setting out the most Accounts and general 
                    and special Maps the Country he is about to visit and them properly fitted up on Linen in order render them convenient for the pocket 
                    to refer to as often as he reads any of the Country (1:22) </p>
                
                <p>On making memoranda: In spite of the greatest care and attention many objects will escape even a well prepared mind 
                    therefore people cannot familiarize themselves too much at Home those objects they intend to inquire Abroad 
                    which they ought to accustom themselves to frequently reflect upon before their Journey the Memory be extremely assisted by putting down the Queries 
                    which they wish to be answered by various Persons at various places Never stir without Paper Pen and Ink and a Note Book in your Pocket 
                    Notes made with Pencils are easily obliterated by the motion of Travelling 
                    Commit to Paper whatever you See Hear or Read that is remarkable with your sensations on observing it do this upon the Spot if possible at the moment it first strikes 
                    at all events do not delay it beyond the first convenient opportunity It cannot be too strongly impressed on the minds of persons about to travel the advantage that will result 
                    to them in making Memorandums of every thing that comes before their Notice at the Moment whether it regards the places they are passing through 
                    the remarks of the Inhabitants or the inconvenience they suffer for having (2:25-26, quoted from RCM)</p>
                
                <p>On passports: (The following paragraphs are from Ga lignani's Traveller's Guide through France 16mo 1825 p 32 
                    Blank's Paris sold by Leigh No 18 Strand is also well worthy the purchase of those who go to France) 
                    Passport Before the traveller sets out it is indispensable for him to procure a passport 
                    which is to be obtained gratis by applying at the house of the French Ambassador No 50 Portland Place 
                    between the hours of twelve and four 
                    It is advisable a day or two before departure to leave the name and mention the Road intended to be taken 
                    If he calls at the Office on the following day between one and three he will obtain the passport signed by the Ambassador 
                    It is perfectly unnecessary to apply at the Foreign Office as was formerly the case the passport of the French Ambassador will be quite sufficient 
                    Should the traveller wish to go through Belgium or Holland before he goes to France he may pro cure a passport by addressing a Letter to the Ambassador of the Netherlands No 1 4 
                    Buckingham Street Strand signed by two respectable Housekeepers to whom he may be known the passport will then be granted on the following day free of expense 
                    the Office is open from eleven to three o clock 
                    
                    On arriving at the opposite coast it is usual to give a small gratuity to the steward and sailors of the packet 
                    The moment the vessel reaches the shore Police Officers generally step on board to demand the passengers passports 
                    which are immediately sent to the Police Office and afterwards to Paris 
                    On paying two francs a temporary passport is given which serves the tourist till he reaches the Capital 
                    In travelling the passports will sometimes be demanded at the gates of the chief fortified towns and examined by the officer on duty Persons arriving in a town 
                    where there is an Ambassador of their nation may as a matter of etiquette leave cards The luggage is taken to the customhouse to be examined and soon returned 
                    The Traveller may avoid trouble by his luggage with the Commissioners of Inn he may put up at (1:192-97)
                </p>
                
                <p>On travelling in France: Travelling in France The first place to which an English Traveller directs his course is Paris 
                    and whether he has or has not before visited the Capital he will proceed thither as the central point from whence he may make excursions into the other parts of France 
                    Having arrived at Paris the usual tour and that which promises the highest degree of gratification is towards the south returning by the western departments to the Capital 
                    and embracing every object of importance in this fine country The journey may be performed in about three months for an expense of about 100 This calculation (1: 198) </p>
