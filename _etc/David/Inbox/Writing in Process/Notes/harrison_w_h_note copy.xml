                <head type="title">W. H. Harrison (ca. 1792&#x2013;1878)</head>
                <p>Sources (<!--Entry needed here.-->) give Harrison&#x02BC;s birth date as <!--Entry needed here.-->, but in a 20 November 1873
                    letter to John Ruskin, Harrison mentions his age as 81 (RL
                    L5).</p>
                <p>Editor of Ruskin&#x02BC;s early published verse, and editor
                    of&#x2014;and himself a frequent contributor to&#x2014;literary
                    annuals. He succeeded Thomas Pringle and H. D. Inglis as editor of
                    <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi>. He did not rely on
                    writing and editing as his primary income: in his reminiscences, he mentions
                    holding positions in connection with banking houses, and Ruskin seats him at a
                    &#x201C;desk in the Crown Life Office&#x201D; (Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>,
                    34:99), referring apparently to the Crown Life Assurance Company,
                    which existed from at least the early 1830s at New Bridge
                    Street, Blackfriars. (In 1856&#x2013;58, the building was handsomely
                    remodeled in Venetian Gothic by Deane and Woodward [O&#x02BC;Dwyer,
                    <hi rend="italic">Architecture of Deane and Woodward</hi>, 311&#x2013;16]).
                    Like the Ruskin family in the 1830s&#x2013;40s, the Harrisons resided in
                    the suburb of Camberwell.</p>
                <p>When the Ruskins first became acquainted with Harrison in 18<!--Entry needed here.-->, he would have
                    been able to regale them with reports of conversation with such relics of
                    Regency literary society as William Beckford (<!--Entry needed here.-->&#x2013;<!--Entry needed here.-->) as well as
                    with minor, but influential literary men of the day, such as the editor William
                    Jerdan (<!--Entry needed here.-->&#x2013;<!--Entry needed here.-->) and the author and clergyman George Croly
                    (<!--Entry needed here.-->&#x2013;<!--Entry needed here.-->). Harrison&#x02BC;s piquant recollections of famous
                    writers&#x02BC; appearance, haunts, and conversation suggest a man of humor
                    and observation, and a frequenter of convivial and benevolent institutions such
                    as the Literary Fund Club. Harrison, then, was a respectable City man with
                    literary and artistic connections, who would have appealed to John James Ruskin,
                    and who importantly could introduce the Ruskins to the fringes of the early
                    Victorian literary world.</p>
                <p>According to his reminiscences, Harrison traced his first encounter with a famous
                    author to hearing S. T. Coleridge (<!--Entry needed here.-->&#x2013;<!--Entry needed here.-->), in lectures that can
                    be dated <!--Entry needed here.-->, when Harrison would have been <!--Entry needed here.--> years old.
                    &#x201C;He was giving a series of lectures on the Belles
                    Lettres in a large room on the first floor of a sixth&#2010;rate tavern at
                    the end of a blind alley on the right hand side of Fetter Lane, not far from
                    Fleet Street. . . . I heard Coleridge lecture the same winter at the Surrey
                    Institution, formerly the Leverean Museum, on the Surrey side of Blackfriars
                    Bridge&#x201D; (Harrison, &#x201C;Notes and
                    Reminiscences&#x201D; [May 1878] 537, 538). These lectures <!--Entry needed here.-->.
                    Harrison was also personally acquainted with artists, even prior to
                    his association with the Ruskins. His association with William Etty
                    (<!--Entry needed here.-->&#x2013;<!--Entry needed here.-->) reached back to <!--Entry needed here.-->,
                    &#x201C;When I first knew Etty he was a pupil of Sir Thomas
                    Lawrence&#x201D; (Harrison, &#x201C;Notes and
                    Reminiscences&#x201D; [May 1878] 538). This was <!--Entry needed here.-->. Where are the
                    JJR/WHH letters mentioned in Viljoen, Ruskin&#x02BC;s Backgrounds? Says
                    50 letters, 1857&#x2013;63 <!--Correction needed here?--> and he mentions inviting Ruskin as
                    &#x201C;a very young man&#x201D; to dine at his house with artists
                    such as David Roberts (1796&#x2013;1864) (Harrison, &#x201C;Notes and
                    Reminiscences&#x201D; [May 1838] p. 538, [June 1878] pp.
                    701&#x2013;2).</p>
                <p>Harrison knew Roberts from their common association with
                    <hi rend="italic">Jennings Landscape Annual</hi>, but they did not collaborate on
                    Roberts&#x02BC;s important work for that publication based on his Spanish
                    excursion of 1832&#x2013;33. The letterpress for those volumes of
                    <!--Entry needed here.-->&#x2013;<!--Entry needed here.--> was written by Thomas Roscoe (<!--Entry needed here.-->&#x2013;<!--Entry needed here.-->).
                    Instead, for the volume of 1839, Harrison collaborated with the artist James
                    Holland (<!--Entry needed here.-->&#x2013;<!--Entry needed here.-->) on depictions of Portugal, the logical
                    follow&#2010;up on the successful Spanish volumes (see
                    Saglia, &#x201C;Imag(in)ing Iberia&#x201D;). Surely it is no accident
                    that Harrison&#x02BC;s writing about Portugal for this important landscape
                    annual fell so close in time to his first introduction to his Camberwell
                    neighbors, the partner in a firm importing sherry from the vineyards of Pedro
                    Domecq <!--Entry needed here.-->.</p>
                <p>Subsequently, Portugal became something of a specialty of Harrison&#x02BC;s,
                    supplying the setting for other tales and poems in the annuals, such as <!--Entry needed here.-->.
                    Harrison is self&#2010;consciously a writer of &#x201C;light
                    literature,&#x201D; however, and, for him,
                    a &#x201C;specialty&#x201D; necessarily reflected a cultural
                    phenomenon&#x2014;in this case, the appeal of the Iberian peninsula to the
                    late Romantic and early Victorian imagination, owing to Spain&#x02BC;s
                    occupation and looting by Napoleon and subsequent liberation, along with
                    subsequent visits by Roberts and David Wilkie <!--Entry needed here.--> figuring in prominence of <!--Entry needed here.-->.
                    It is not known that Harrison ever visited this country&#x2014;Ruskin
                    intimates that his old friend had never left England (Ruskin,
                    <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> <!--Entry needed here.-->)&#x2014;and it seems likely that Harrison worked in the
                    fashion of many writers for the ephemeral travel literature of the day, culling
                    and synthesizing information available in the vast outpouring of volumes
                    published by travelers to exotic places. This approach is significant as it
                    provides some basis for speculating about the manner of conversation between
                    Harrison and John James Ruskin, who did possibly travel to Portugal prior to his
                    marriage <!--Entry needed here.-->, and who was a partner with the Portuguese vintner Pedro Domecq <!--Entry needed here.-->.</p>
                <p>The reticence of Harrison, &#x201C;Notes and Reminiscences,&#x201D; in
                    which he mentions the Ruskins only in passing, perhaps played a part in
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s crafting of the much more delicately balanced
                    rhetoric&#x2014;poised between nostalgic admiration and critical
                    satire&#x2014;of his introduction to these sketches, &#x201C;My First
                    Editor: An Autobiographical Reminiscence&#x201D; (Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>,
                    34:93&#x2013;104). For his part, Harrison appears to have
                    deemed reflection on his friendship and professional relation with the Ruskins
                    as out of bounds for his &#x201C;Reminiscences,&#x201D; with the
                    possible exception of the section on Oxford. That recollection reads like an
                    unused travel sketch for the annuals, recounted by the narrator of his other
                    tales and sketches&#x2014;genial, ironic, given to rhetorical flourish. The
                    sketch concludes by opening a window only slightly on the relationship he
                    developed with the &#x201C;Graduate of Oxford&#x201D;: &#x201C;As
                    in athletics, so in intellectual contests, life is often the price of the prize.
                    Here is a poem from the pen of an undergraduate, who has since achieved a
                    world&#2010;wide fame. It was published without the name of the author, and I
                    dare not add it&#x201D;&#x2014;and he quotes &#x201C;Christ
                    Church, Oxford&#x201D; ([August 1878] p. 223). The mixture of anxiety and
                    nostalgia speaks worlds without giving much away.</p>
                <p> <!--Entry needed here.-->. In later years, WHH approved of JR&#x02BC;s denunciations of

                    given me more pleasure than I can express. You have thrown the Bible at the
