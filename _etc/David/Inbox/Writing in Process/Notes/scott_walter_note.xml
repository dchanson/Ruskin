                <head type="title">Walter Scott (1771&#x2013;1832)</head>
                <p>Scottish poet and novelist. Scott is a source for some of Ruskin's earliest imitations of imaginative writing.
                </p>
                <p>In January 1834, when Ruskin's father wrote in reply to 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="hogg_james_note.html"><persName corresp="JH">James Hogg</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1770" notAfter="1835">1770&#x2013;1835</date>)</ref>, 
                    who had asked for an account of Ruskin's progress in using his wonderful abilities, John James included a sample of John's rhymes, possibly taken from 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.html">Account of a Tour on the Continent</ref>, which Ruskin was composing at that time. 
                    Hogg's critique of the lines, which is known only from Ruskin's reply to Hogg, dwelled on the boy's imitation of Scott and Byron, 
                    presumably intending to encourage greater originality. 
                    Ruskin's comment identifies the boy's touchstone in Scott's poetry: 
                    "If I could write one piece of poetry in my lifetime at all resembling the description of the battle of Flodden field, 
                    I think toward the conclusion of Marmion, it would be enough honour for me" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#GARDENMEMORIALS">Garden, ed., <hi rend="italic">Memorials of James Hogg</hi></ref>, 277).
                </p>
                <p>Striking poetic diction in Ruskin's verse often can be traced to Scott's novels and poetry; see, e.g., <ref type="witness" target="lille_poem_msia_g1.html"></ref>, line 12;</p>
