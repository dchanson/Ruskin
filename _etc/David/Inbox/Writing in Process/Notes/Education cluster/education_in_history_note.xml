                <head type="title">Education in History</head>
                <p> In <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi>, Ruskin declares that, in his home
                    education, &#x201C;history was never thought of, beyond what I chose to read of Scott&#x02BC;s
                        <hi rend="italic">Tales of a Grandfather</hi>&#x201D; (Ruskin, <hi rend="italic"
                            >Works</hi>, 35:57). Indeed, literature must have framed much of Ruskin&#x02BC;s
                    historical learning, as did travel and the books associated with
                    travel&#x2014;landscape annuals, travel guides, and the like&#x2014;along with what he saw of
                    historical art, whether in reproduction or in the course of travel. These are of
                    course dramatic means of learning about historical events, if not
                    historiography, but these experiences probably were not as happenstance as
                    Ruskin suggests in his autobiography. A deliberate plan of reading is indicated
                    by John James Ruskin&#x02BC;s lists of acquisitions for the family library. </p>
                <p>A notable interest in history first appears in Ruskin&#x02BC;s writing in 1828&#x2013;29, when
                    he recasts &#x201C;The Ship&#x201D; (1827) as &#x201C;The Ship&#x201D; (1828&#x2013;29), remaking a poem that had
                    been typical mainly of his absorption in visual relationships into one with a
                    historical and patriotic emphasis, as well. Other works of 1828&#x2013;29 reflect the
                    newfound historical interest, and in particular the emphasis on heroism that
                    held sway in John James Ruskin&#x02BC;s book purchases in these years. In general, it
                    might be said that Ruskin&#x02BC;s Enlightenment, Edgeworthian education of 1826&#x2013;27
                    acquires a romantic, historicized turn in 1828&#x2013;29. </p>
                <p>John James acquired Scott&#x02BC;s <hi rend="italic">Tales of a Grandfather</hi> as they
                    were being released (1827&#x2013;29), relating the history of Scotland to the
                    Rebellion of 1745&#x2013;46, in which the Young Pretender <!--Entry needed here.-->. Other Scott novels
                    mentioned in John James&#x02BC;s expenditures at this time include <hi rend="italic"
                        >Redgauntlet</hi> (1824), concerning the Young Pretender; <hi rend="italic"
                        >Peveril of the Peak</hi> (1823), about the alleged anti-Catholic conspiracy
                    against Charles II; <hi rend="italic">Quentin Durward</hi> (1823), concerning
                    the French court of Louis XI in the fifteenth century; and <hi rend="italic">The
                        Fortunes of Nigel</hi> (1822), revolving around the court of James I. The
                    bias for biography is reflected also in a purchase of the Roman historian,
                    Cornelius Nepos, whose surviving work consists largely of the lives of famous
                    military commanders </p>
