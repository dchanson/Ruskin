                <head type="title">Education: Home Tuition and Tutors</head>
                <p>Ruskin, like many early-Victorian middle&#x2010;class children, received his early education primarily in the home. 
                    Home schooling was regarded by many educationists as preferable to schools, particularly if the mother was 
                    available and sufficiently unburdened in order to devote the considerable time, planning, and self-study that the role demanded. 
                    Parents, and especially the mother--assumed to be the "natural" educator of a child--were believed to hold an advantage over schools 
                    in formation of a child's moral and religious character. Schools had a reputation for danger--to the child's character, through 
                    the influence of other, possibly reprobate children; and to the child's physical health 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#THORMAHLENBRONTESEDUCATION">Thorm&#x00E4;hlen, <hi rend="italic">Bront&#x00EB;s and Education</hi></ref>, 34-37).
                </p> 
                <p>Margaret Ruskin, as a conscientious and devoted mother of a single child, and mistress of a surburban household for which John James provided increasing 
                    comfort and prosperity over the course of John's boyhood, was able to give considerable attention to this duty, even though she also had to cope with managing 
                    the household for significant lengths of time when her husband was on the road and occupied with business. According to Ruskin's autobiography, 
                    parental tuition was divided between his mother's Bible reading and his father's secular literary reading 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#WORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 35: ??). As the family letters show, however, 
                    Margaret prepared extensively for her responsibility, well beyond the nortoriously unremitting and exhaustive round of Bible study that Ruskin 
                    later associated with her in <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi>. She read history . . . Rollin; psychology and philosophy . . . Smith. 
                    When Ruskin's cousin, Mary Richardson, joined the household and proved a "disturbance" to John's lessons, the decision to send her to a day school 
                    was not necessarily a result of the Ruskins' insularity, but possibly a recognition of reasonable limits to Margaret's time and abilities (RFL; ??). 
                    As a comparison, Elizabeth Branwell was able to take charge of teaching only Anne Bront&#x00EB;&#x02BC;s to any great extent, 
                    while limiting lessons for Charlotte and Emily to sewing, and of course leaving Branwell's studies to Patrick 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#THORMAHLENBRONTESEDUCATION">Thorm&#x00E4;hlen, <hi rend="italic">Bront&#x00EB;s and Education</hi></ref>, 37).
                    
                </p>
                <p>Day schools were viewed as a compromise between maintaining the advantages of home schooling, which allowed for consistent and scrupulous watch over the child's 
                    developing moral and religious character, and acquiring the advantages an institution, which provided a wider scope for education 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#THORMAHLENBRONTESEDUCATION">Thorm&#x00E4;hlen, <hi rend="italic">Bront&#x00EB;s and Education</hi></ref>, 47).
