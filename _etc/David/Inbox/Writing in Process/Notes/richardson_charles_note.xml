                <head>Charles Thomas Richardson (1811&#x2013;34)</head>
                <p>Cousin of John Ruskin, a son of Margaret Ruskin's sister, Bridget, and her husband George Richardson, a baker. 
                    The Richardsons lived in the suburb of Croydon, near the King's Head, the tavern operated by Margaret and Bridget's mother, Margaret Cock, and the sisters' birthplace. 
                    Margaret took John from a very young age to visit his Croydon cousins, though he was distanced from the family, being kept on walks or in his room, 
                    except for visits by Charles and his sister Mary (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi>, 108).</ref></p>
                <p>By October 1829, Charles was employed by the publisher, Smith, Elder, for at this time he presented John with a copy of 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.html"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></ref>, 
                    the "Literary Album and Annual Remembrancer" that the firm had recently taken over from its initial publisher. The editor was 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="pringle_thomas_note.html">Thomas Pringle (1789&#x2013;1834)</ref>, who was possibly introduced to the Ruskin family through the Smith, Elder connection. 
                    According to <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi>, Charles decided to emigrate to Australia to join his brother, ???, 
                    because advancement at the publishing firm was unlikely. Charles was drowned while the ship remained anchored off Cowes in January 1834 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 35: 135-37). 
                    One wonders whether Pringle--whose experience had been mixed as an immigrant to South Africa, and who coincidentally died later in the same year--had encouraged the move.</p>
