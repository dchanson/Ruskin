\par Earliest Writing and Edgeworthian Education
\par \tab Ruskin\rquote s earliest extant juvenilia dates from 1826, about age seven, aside from probably earlier childish scraw
ls, simple drawings, and practice writing of his name on the flyleaves of his books. Most of the writing from 1826, when Ruskin was seven, through about 1831 is contained in the \'93Red Books\'94
 (MSS I, III, IIIA, IV, IVA, IVB, IVC), a uniform set of seven store-bought notebooks with reddish-brown, flexible leather covers (described as roan in Sotheby }{\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 Cat}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 
. 1930), each approximately ten by fifteen centimeters. }{\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 Red Books}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235  was Ruskin\rquote s own term, used both in childhood, when referring to them in letters to his father
 (e.g., }{\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 RFL}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235  192), and in later years, when reoccu\-pying his old nursery rooms atop the Herne Hill house and meditating on his childhood for }{
\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 Fors}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235  and }{\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 Praeterita}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235  (}{\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 Ruskin\rquote 
s Camberwell}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 , 13\endash 14). Perhaps it was on one of the latter occasions that he wrote }{\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 Red Book}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 
 and an assigned number inside some of these.
\par \tab Contemporane\-ous and in conformity with the Red Books, there also survive three handmade pamphlets (MSS IB, II, and one containing no. 57 now cut apart and its leaves tipped into MS V; MS IB was later profes
sionally bound). Ruskin constructed these from plain paper cut to about the size of the Red Books, folded once and sewed. One pamphlet (see no. 57) was covered with pinkish violet paper, perhaps to make its color uniform with the Red Books. Another (MS II
) bears the heading \'93Vol I,\'94 connecting it with what he called his series of \'93works\'94 (}{\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 RFL}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 , 187).
\par \tab These early \'93works\'94 might be described as bookmaking as much as writing. From the start in MS I, although Ruskin\rquote s pencil printing is still fairly crude, he thinks to \'93justi\-fy\'94 the margins, enclose his illus\-tra\-
tions in frames and number them as \'93plates,\'94 and provide title pages and even colophons. In contents, the Red Books imitate a range of genres, from children\rquote s verse and didactic tales to such adult forms as travel narrative and topographi\-
c verse. In this imitative bookmaking, Ruskin was probably not unusual among Victorian and Edwardian children. Less famous childhoods also left behind scientific \'93monographs,\'94 derivative \'93histories,\'94 and diaries that in
clude illustrated poetry. Some families even privately circulated \'93magazines,\'94 with elaborate nursery pretenses to real-life editorship.}{\f2\fs22\super\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain

\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235  (1807; see nos. 3, 20) are blended with the Ruskin family\rquote s actual travels and experiences. In his first two volumes of \'93Harry and Lucy\'94 (MSS I, III [1826\endash 
28]), Ruskin probably identified with either or both characters Harry and Lucy, although in the portions set at his aunt\rquote s home in Perth, Scotland, he may have associated \'93Lucy\'94
 with his cousins Jessie and Mary Richardson. In the third volume (MS IIIA, 1828), Ruskin concentrates less on travel adventures and more on the family\rquote 
s domestic activities at Herne Hill. Having written this volume after his cousin Mary Richardson had come to live with the family, Ruskin appears to identify more exclusively with Harry, who takes a decidedly preceptorial role over Lucy, identifie
d with Mary. Less impulsive than in the two first volumes, and even priggishly strict with Lucy, Harry determines the daily round as teaching Lucy the constellations before breakfast, lessons after breakfast, drawing maps until dinner, correcting Virgil 
\'93for his papa\'94 and more mapmaking in the afternoon, and listening to papa read }{\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 Don Quixote}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235  until bed (no. 32).
\par \tab Seen whole, the earlier juvenilia reveals how extensively the Ruskins invested in the Edgeworths\rquote  program. Ruskin\rquote s first extant poem and slightly later works (nos. 1, ??) are drawn from }{\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235

Practical Education}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235  (1798\endash 1801). Dialogue promotes the fundamental premise of the Edgeworth system, that appeals should be made to children\rquote s reason, and that they should be encouraged to th
ink for themselves. Ruskin\rquote s Harry and Lucy, much like Edgeworth\rquote 
s Frank and the much beleaguered Rosamond, are quizzed by Mamma, who treats ordinary events as opportunities to admonish self-discipline or to practice multiplication tables. Papa, in both Ru
skin and Edgeworth, is less prone to these Pumblechookian methods, and is reserved for more exciting and brilliant experiments and excursions.

o detect gestures characteristically his own, when, for example, at the close of his first \'93Harry and Lucy\'94
 (no. 3) he combines an electrical experiment from Joyce, not just with elegant scientific verse, but with a haunting image from Lord Byron. In part, the romance in Ruskin\rquote 
s early writing shows merely that he possessed the materials to temper the Edgeworth\rquote s hostility to \'93inflaming the imagination, or exciting a restless spirit of adventure, by exhibiting false views of life, and creating hopes which, 
in the ordinary course of things, cannot be realized\'94 (preface to }{\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 Parent\rquote s Assistant}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 
). It is better for Rosamond to tour a cotton factory, even though she is too young to understand the machinery, than to dream over imaginary things (Edgeworth, }{\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 Rosamond}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235

 psychologically; however, I would refine that point to add that Ruskin was very early, and very precociously interested in the processes of his own mind\emdash if, by that, one refers to what Sheila Emerson has called \'93the laws of motion\'94
 that Ruskin believed re
flected both in his own mind on paper and in the outward nature he beheld. Margaret Ruskin, for her part, was probably more prone than Mrs. Sherwood to enforce on children, alongside obedience, the Protestant duty of self-examination; it was in such terms
 that she probably understood the progressive Edgeworthian recommendation that children reason their way to conclusions, rather than merely accept them. When she read to the ten-year-old Ruskin and his cousin Mary from Adam Smith, that they may \'93
observe something of the working of their own minds,\'94 her ultimate aim was that they gain \'93more knowledge [of] themselves\'94 (}{\i\f2\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 RFL}{\f2\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235  186). }}}{

 Ibid., 203\endash 12.}}}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235  Ruskin, on the other hand, began his \'93mature\'94 work in childhood. While the earlier \'93Harry and Lucy\'94 books show charming (and extraordinarily talented) imitations of children
\rquote s stories and verse, within a few years the juvenilia so elaborately copies an adult library that the pieces appear more to be a child\rquote s offering in miniature of adult productions beyond his years. In reading the Bront\'eb
 sagas, one feels oneself trespassing deeper and deeper into an arcane wonderland wrought by the authors for their private adventuring\emdash an effect that would be heightened, I assume, by the privilege of poring over Charlotte\rquote 
s microscopic handwriting and preciously tiny booklets. Ruskin\rquote s hand and booklets, too, are small enough to make reading uncomfortable at times, but they do not begin to approach Charlotte\rquote 
s feats. In reading the early Ruskin, rather, one is invited to survey a public spectacle\emdash from his paired epics \'93Iteriad\'94 and \'93Athens\'94 to his \'93Poem on the Universe\'94 called \'93Eudosia\'94\emdash 
and to admire the mere child who is showing off to his parents \'93how well he could do it\'94 (}{\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 Works}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 , 35:72). At the same time, the more one 
studies the early Ruskin especially of the rough-draft notebooks (MSS VI, VIII), the more one is struck by how, behind the public performances and spilling into them, Ruskin reveals secrets, fantasies, and emotional turmoil. Ruskin encoded these secrets i
n various ways, perhaps concealing turmoil even from himself, but the emotions nonetheless continue to trouble his characteristically ebullient voice.
\par \tab The \'93Harry and Lucy\'94 books are filled out with short poems. In MS I, the verses are based partly on what he found in children\rquote s books, although some of these poems, such as the previously unpublished \'93On Papa\rquote s Leaving Home\'94
 (no. 8), already display a highly inventive and interesting emotional response to his father\rquote s departures on business trips; other poems, such as \'93On Scotland\'94
 (no. 6) may already show Ruskin responding to family deaths. Loss, whether by death or absence, is a prominent theme in the suppressed fragments; both \'93The Monastery\'94 (no. 46) and \'93Athens\'94 (no. 135) break off with the despondent far
ewells or the absences of older males.
\par \tab By 1827, in MS III, Ruskin is imitating adult polite verse in a section named \'93poetry discriptive\'94 (}{\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 sic}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 
), although, again, these poems already reveal an individualistic acuity in perception of visual relationships, as Emerson has remarked. Another verse grouping, also in MS III but dating from 1829, includes the versifi\-cation of the opening of Scott
\rquote s }{\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 The Monastery}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 , Ruskin\rquote s project for \'93a novel\'94 (}{\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 RFL}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 
, 185). Also from 1829, the handmade booklet \'93Battle of Waterloo . . . with Other Small Poems\'94
 imitates the verse drama publications of the period. At about the same time, beginning in 1828, Ruskin exhibits a fine Augustan confidence in surveying the creation by devoting a Red Book (MS IV) to \'93Eudosia; or, a Poem on the Universe.\'94
\par \tab Of the remainder of the earlier juvenilia, one Red Book was used in 1827 for Ruskin\rquote s first Latin exercises, prior to Andrews\rquote 
s instruction (MS IVA). Another Red Book (MS IVB) was begun as a personalized guidebook and itinerary for the family\rquote s English tour of 1828. Additionally, besides all these notebook productions, Ruskin celebrated his father\rquote s birth\-
days, New Year\rquote s, and sometimes his own birthday, by presenting John James with fancy copies of odes composed to commemorate the occasions, alo
ng with other kinds of poems. For these he used the most elaborate print or script that he could muster at the time\emdash either his most careful early print in imitation of typeface or a \'93double\'94 print that, as a \'93Harry and Lucy\'94
 episode records, cost him so much time that he rarely again attempted it. Later, he employed a more rapid \'93copperplate\'94 hand, sometimes decorated with flourishes drawn an arithmetic and orthography primer (see }{
\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 RFL}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 , 259, 261 n. 17). The presentation poems were copied on sheets folded ver
tically as a folio; then the folios were sometimes folded twice horizontally, like a letter, and a superscrip\-tion added to the outside\emdash typically, \'93To My Father\'94
 and a date. Many of these were bound later by Wedderburn in MSS IA and XI along with other miscellaneous poems and letters.
\par \tab \'93Eudosia\'94 eventually faltered in 1830, with only one volume on \'93Botany\'94 (containing book 1 and part of book 2) carried from flowers through a catalog of trees. From here, Ruskin went on undaunted to \'93Iteriad\'94 (MS VII), a four
-book verse account of the family tour to the Lakes in 1830, on which he worked until 1832. When, in 1831, he had finished drafting (but not fair-copying) \'93Iteriad,\'94 he began \'93Athens,\'94 a verse narrative of Xerxes\rquote 
 great march climaxing the Persian Wars. Since Ruskin was translating the }{\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 Iliad}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 
 at the time, he no doubt was inspired to attempt the ultimate epic achievement: to pair an epic on travel adventure\emdash his own }{\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 Odyssey}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235  in \'93Iteriad,\'94

ished, in its draft or its fair copy. Meanwhile, between 1829 and 1832, Ruskin was using a smaller notebook (MS V, not a Red Book) entitled \'93Miscellaneous Poetry\'94 to gather together fair copies of the shorter poems\emdash a sort
 of collected minor poems.
\par \tab A change is noticeable from about 1831, age twelve, when Ruskin was engaged in fair-copying \'93Iteriad\'94 and in drafting \'93Athens,\'94 and when his home studies were extended to include modern languages, mathematics, more advanced Lati

 in the Red Books. The two sketchbooks exhibit picturesque sketches taken during tours of the southeast of England. Later, in 1833\endash 34, the remark\-able Account of a Tour on the Contine

articles on mineralogy, algebra and geometry exercises, and sketches that turn up in finished form as \'93plates\'94 in MS IX. The mineralogy notes and catalogs, which begin about 1830\endash 
31 with a Red Book devoted to the subject (MS IVC), evolve into the ambitious Mineralogical Dictionary (MS IVD [1831\endash 36]), Ruskin\rquote s own redaction of primers on geological identification and classification, such as Jameson\rquote s }{

\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 , to which Ruskin himself would contribute brief scientific papers in 1834.
\par \tab By their appearance, the Sermon Books (MSS IIA\endash E) seem positioned between the earlier juvenile Red Books and the later aspirations of the young scholar. By their date also, the sermons\rquote  composition belong to a transitional period, 1832
\endash 34. In some physical respects, the Sermon Books are similar to the earlier pamphlets constructed to conform with the Red Books. Handmade and mi
niature, the pamphlets measure only 9.5 by 15.5 centimeters, with a text space of only 7.5 by 15 centimeters, into which Ruskin packed roughly fifty lines and even seventy-five on some pages. By this time, however, the Red Books themselves were in their r
ecycled stage of use, and in fact some of the Red Books were reused to draft the sermons. Moreover, the Sermon Books, despite their pre\-cious dimensions, appear more sober than the \'93Harry and Lucy\'94
 books, linking them to the formal textbook presentations of contemporaneous and later prose\emdash the }{\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 Iliad}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 
 translation, the Mineralogical Dictionary, and, later, the first critical essays (MSS XB, no. 270; MS XIB). The ink script is studiously neat longhand, rather than the printing meant to imitate typeface that had been used for poetry before the \'93
Iteriad.\'94 Title headings follow a consis\-tent pattern and, appropriate to the solemn contents, show minimal ornamentation. The margins are \'93justified\'94 so rigor\-ously that, rather than spoil the effect, words are divided acco
rding to how much fits on the line rather than by syllable; hyphens are omitted if space disallows; curlicues, commas, and dots are }{\i\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 added}{\f2\fs22\insrsid4728235\charrsid4728235 
 to bring a short line to the margin (easily misread as punctuation by the unwary); and paragraphs are indicated with only the barest indentation or with only a slight line space.
\par \tab In content as well, the Sermon Books are especially interesting as reflecting both a self-conscious childishness and a rapidly maturing thought and learning. Although the persona most frequently
 impersonates an elder, learned divine expositing scripture to his congregation, the writer also speaks as a pious child when the occasion demands, such as when commenting on the Fifth Commandment. The boy\rquote 
s perspective on the doctrine of his church is invaluable, especially as a source for understanding the foundations of Ruskin\rquote s mature religious thought.
