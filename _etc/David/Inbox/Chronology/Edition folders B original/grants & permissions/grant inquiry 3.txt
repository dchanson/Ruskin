Project Field Code--"Early Ruskin Mss" includes poetry, sermons, mineralogical investigations, fine arts criticism, travel, to name only the more prominent areas. Do I call it "Humanities, U8"? In terms of the number of individual titles, poetry predominates; in terms of percentages of actual writing, science, travel, and religion are as significant as literary work.
