TIME  BLANK VERSE
PAPA whats time a figure or a sense
Tis one but not the other. Is not time
A figure. Yes it is for on the tops of shops
We often see a figure with two wings
A scythe upon one shoulder and a lock
Of hair upon his forehead while his head is bald
Except the lock upon his forehead and called time
Times very quick and therefore he has wings
When past times gone for ever so he has a lock
Of hair upon his forehead and the proverb is
Take time by his forelock he mows down every thing
And so he has a scythe time is so quick
That might a year be called a day
Day now I think of it ’tis newyearsday
A happy new years day to you papa
And now I must return to time
Is time only a figure no he is not
What is he then what is he I dont know
He’s not a quality of that I’m sure
Oh I remember now he is a god
Entitled Saturn he’s a heathen god
And well he might be called one none but they
Could go so quick or jump from tween our hands
As time does, time I’m quite away from him
Away from him no surely I’m not so
For I’m at heathen gods and he’s a god
So though I may be from him I’m not far
From him and now I must go to him quite
Tis but an hour to merry Newyearsday
For though it is a-day a-day’s an hour
And what’s an hour ’tis only a wee minute
Made so by the quick course of time
So mr time as I’ve said all about you
All I’ve to say I must take leave of you
