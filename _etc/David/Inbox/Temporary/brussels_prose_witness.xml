                <p><placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> is a lovely, a queen&#x2010;like city&#x2014;from a distance, sweeping up 
                    the flanks of its hill, battlement over battlement swelling up higher, and 
                    higher, and (yet) higher, and the massive obscurity of the two huge square 
                    cathedral tow&#x02BC;rs looming over the whole, and contrasted strangely with 
                    the delicate sharp spiriness of the steeple of the <placeName corresp="#HOTELDEVILLE">H&#x00F4;tel de ville</placeName>. <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName> 
                    would look like an assemblage of brick&#x2010;kilns beside it. We saw <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> 
                    at eleven miles&#x02BC; distance, its towers rising dark and spear&#x2010;like out of the 
                    horizon. It was waxing dark as we entered the city, and the lights began 
                    to twinkle in the few, the very few shop windows. I love to pass through 
                    a city at night, the hum of the voices rises so softly out of the obscurity, 
                    and the figures flit about dark and bat&#x2010;like, and the cold starlight mingles 
                    so strangely with the red swarthy gleam of the lamps; and when you look 
                    up, the narrow strip of sky is of such a dark, dark blue, you may see it 
                    appear to quiver with the starlight if you look long, and the white house&#x2010; 
                    fronts rise so ghastly, so ghost&#x2010;like against it, and the windows seem 
                    grinning maliciously askance at you. It makes one shiver to think of it. 
                    Cities are exceedingly picturesque when built upon hills; but for exploring, 
                    for circumnavigating, for perambulating&#x2014;Oh, woe to the walker who is 
                    compelled to drag himself up their steeps, those tiresome paved steeps,
                    <pb/>
                    those hard, unyielding, provokingly smooth flagstones, or to go thundering 
                    down, his rapidity increasing every instant, when he is once in for it 
                    lurching tremendously like a ship in a swell, jerk, jerk, jerking&#x2014;<emph>Oh, facilis 
                    descensus Averni, sed sed;</emph>&#x2014;Ay, there's the rub. The H&#x00F4;tel de Bellevue 
                    at <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> ought to have a <emph>belle vue</emph> for you might as well scale the crags 
                    of <placeName corresp="#GIBRALTAR">Gibraltar</placeName> as storm the heights of the H&#x00F4;tel de Bellevue; whence, for all 
                    the boast of its title, I never could discover more <emph>belle vue</emph> than a dusty 
                    square, some formal houses, and a few murky park trees. </p>
                    
                <p>We left <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> on Wednesday morning for <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName>; the sun beamed 
                    sweetly among the long trunks of the aged trees of the forest of Soigny; 
                    and their damp bark glistened dewily,&#x2014;as it rose up taller and taller, 
                    branching off into the bending boughs, and slender spray, with the delicate 
                    foliage scattered through: here every leaf defined separately and clearly 
                    as you looked up to the broad sky; there in light, spready masses, par&#x2010; 
                    tially concealing the long tapery trunks which retired back, farther and 
                    still farther, yet distinctly grouped, and those groups separated by the 
                    gleamy stream of yellow sunshine, which shone full on the sides of the 
                    swelling green grassy banks, then broken by the intervening hollows, 
                    then climbing again up the dewy moss and white trunks. It was exceed- 
                    ing beautiful; I could have fancied the glister of the bright bayonets 
                    changing, like starlight on a wavy ocean, among the retiring foliage of 
                    those ancient trees&#x2014;I forgot how many long years had past by since 
                    that eventful day. </p>
                    
                    <p>This is the field of <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName>. The round hills of green pasture lay 
                    unbroken before me, without a single tree, except where, fax to the right, 
                    the rich forest country commenced again, breaking away in rounded 
                    masses, till lost in the blue of the faint horizon. All is peace now. 
                    Englishmen may feel proud on the field of Waterloo&#x2014;perhaps I did; but 
                    there is something mingled with it&#x2014;Poor <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>! The grass is very 
                    green on the field of <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName>&#x2014;it has grown from the dust of our bravest. 
                    Oh, tread on it softly!  </p>
