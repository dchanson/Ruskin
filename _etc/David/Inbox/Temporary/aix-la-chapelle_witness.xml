                    treaties of peace have been entered into, and ratified, which thou wilt not 
                    approve of. Thou shalt find a treaty whereof the first condition is that 
                    the postillion&#x02BC;s whip be not closely acquainted with the back of his quad&#x2010; 
                    rupeds more than two or three times in a stage, or so. </p>
                    
                <p>Item. That the above mentioned quadrupeds be not compelled to 
                    draw any carriage, chariot, gig, or other vehicle whatsoever at a greater 
                    rate than two miles an hour. </p>

                    upon the paved centre of the road, but that they be permitted to draw 
                    carriage, chariot, gig, or other vehicle into the beds of sand and dust, 
                    denominated by the postillion &#x201C;la terre,&#x201D; even although the carriage, 
                    chariot, gig, or other vehicle be in imminent danger of being overset into 
                    the ditch, which commonly bordereth upon the road. </p>
                    
                <p>Item. That the postillion be permitted, when upon the back of his 
                    horse, to indulge himself with a comfortable pipe, and half hour&#x02BC;s nap or 
                    so, during which time his above&#x2010;mentioned quadrupeds be surrendered to 
                    their own will, guidance, and management.</p> 
                    
                <p>Alas! every article of this treaty was strictly fulfilled with regard to us, 
                    and the consequence was, that in a six hours&#x02BC; ride of twelve miles, I was 
                    first fevered by the sun, then smothered by the dust, and finally was&#x2014;but 
                    let that pass for the present. </p>
                    
                <p>A cathedral is a noble, a beautiful, a sublime thing, by twilight, with 
                    its white fretted marble columns looking out from the dark retiring 
                    immensity of the long aisles, and the faint streams of coloured and varie&#x2010; 
                    gated light falling faintly through the Gothic windows, streaming at 
                    intervals along the chequered floors, or ruddily lighting up the countenances 
                    of the marble figures, giving a ghastly resemblance to reality, a mockery of 
                    life, that makes you start when you look upon the hollow eyes and rigid 
                    muscles starting out of the stone. You almost think that the dead forms 
                    of departed monarchs have sprung forth from their narrow dwellings
                    <pb/>
                    beneath that ancient pavement, and that the peers of Charlemagne are 
                    rallying again around their monarch.</p> 
                    
                <p>Saw Charlemagne&#x02BC;s easy&#x2010;chair&#x2014;arms stone, back stone, hard, indepen&#x2010; 
                    dent, unaccommodating granite. Thin velvet cushion, however, on the 
                    seat as a mediator. Very ancient affair; product of the dark ages, I 
                    suppose. His sarcophagus also, sculptured, Grecian, basso&#x2010;relievo. The 
                    revolutionists amused themselves by depriving the poor stone gentlemen 
                    of their olfactory nerves, alias noses; consequence, they look all terrible 
                    flats. Night coming on, left the cathedral just in time to be tantalised 
                    by grinning at a magnificent picture when it was pitch dark (Last Judg&#x2010;
