                            earlier to his father, as he recalled in the <date when="1829-05-10">10 May 1829</date> birthday letter 
                            (not a posted letter, by any external evidence, but a cover letter inscribed on the outside, in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand, 
                            as &#x201C;Birthday Odes &#x007C; To my dear Papa&#x201D;). On that earlier occasion, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had temporized 
                            because the poem &#x201C;was designed for your birthday and I did not wish you to see it beforehand.&#x201D; He goes on to explain that 
                            there was even &#x201C;a line [in the draft] saying something about this happy day and I was afraid you would ask me what happy day and then the whole secret would 
                            gradually have been hauled out of my unwilling mouth&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 199). 
                            The evasive maneuveur that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was recalling may have occurred about <date when="1829-04">April 1829</date>, 
                            when a gap in the surviving family letters possibly indicates that <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> was at home and not traveling for wine orders.</p>
                        <p>Such a line about a &#x201C;happy day&#x201D; is indeed contained in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title> draft,

                            The line recurs in the fair&#x2010;copy version, <ref type="witness" target="on_skiddaw_and_derwent_water_msv.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATERMSV">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D;</title></ref>,

                            On the occasion prior to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s birthday, to which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> refers, he apparently copied or recited a version that is not represented by extant copies, 
                            since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> writes that he &#x201C;found a way of evading this line as I found that when it was missed the poem sounded quite well without it&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 200).</p>
                        <p>As <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName> remarks, &#x201C;the poem &#x2018;Derwentwater,&#x2019; which was apparently sent to [<persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>] as an enclosure with [Ruskin&#x02BC;s 10 May 1829] letter is no longer with it&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 200 n. 2). 
                            However, since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> inscribed the letter as &#x201C;Birthday Odes&#x201D;&#x2014;using the plural&#x2014;the presentation copy may not have been devoted solely to the 
                            topographical poem. Rather, the enclosure may have been the handmade booklet, 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="battle_of_waterloo_ms_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#BATTLEOFWATERLOOMS">&#x201C;Battle of Waterloo, A Play, in Two Acts, with Other Small Poems, Dedicated to His Father&#x201D;</title></ref>,
                            which contains the only surviving fair copy in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand. The description of the enclosure in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s letter matches this booklet more convincingly 
                            if one omits <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>&#x02BC;s bracketed editorial insertion: &#x201C;On Newyearsday I prepared a small poem for you,&#x201D; 
                            and therefore &#x201C;on your birthday it becomes me to have a much larger [one] for you&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 199). That is, by a &#x201C;larger,&#x201D; 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have meant, not just a single larger poem, but a larger project&#x2014;the handmade booklet, which he dated <date when="1829">1829</date> on its cover, and which contains 
                            along with the poem several other poems and a play. The pamphlet also precisely meets the inscription on the letter, &#x201C;Birthday Odes,&#x201D; 
                            since it includes a fair copy of another <date when="1829">1829</date> birthday poem, <ref type="apparatus" target="may_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#MAY">&#x201C;May&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                            Finally, the rough draft, <title corresp="#JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATERMSII">&#x201C;description of skiddaw &#x0026; lake derwent&#x201D;</title>, 
                            wraps around a fragment of text that may represent a brief idea for the play. 
                            Despite all this, one cannot discount the possibility that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1829-05-10">10 May 1829</date> letter once accompanied a fair&#x2010;copy version, 
                            presently unknown, which contained the topographical poem, perhaps paired with the second birthday ode, <title type="poem" corresp="#MAY">&#x201C;May&#x201D;</title>.</p>
                        <p>The poem is composed in blank verse, except for the final ten lines, given the heading &#x201C;conclusion&#x201D; in the rough draft, which are formed from rhymed octosyllabic couplets. 
                            Structurally, the rough draft works by strophes being added one to the next, using explicit transitions, such as 
                            &#x201C;Ive treated of the clouds. now <geogName corresp="#SKIDDAW">skiddaw</geogName> come&#x201D; and &#x201C;Now <geogName corresp="#DERWENTWATER">derwent water</geogName> come.&#x201D; 
                            Writing the the poem in stages, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> changed from pencil to pen, and from one color of ink to another. 
                            Twice, he interrupted composition of the poem with other texts. Given this structure of built&#x2010;up units over time, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> perceived the draft as easily expandable, yet also as contractible&#x2014;as suggested by a deleted ninth line, seemingly a relic of a premature ending, 
                            &#x201C;Now hear my boyish moral.&#x201D; Yet the poem&#x02BC;s title indicates that, from the start, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> projected a complex poem. 
                            There is no evidence that he arrived seriatim at his compound subject of mountain and lake; rather, since the title shows no cramping on the page, 
                            as if &#x201C;&#x0026; lake derwent&#x201D; had been added as an afterthought, he appears to have conceptualized the &#x201C;description&#x201D; of mountain and of lake as &#x201C;reechoed&#x201D; 
                            and &#x201C;reflected&#x201D; in one another, as the final lines state the relation. Overall, the poem represents a sustained and ambitious effort.</p>

                            Thus, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s first poem to appear in print, and his first publication of any kind, was

                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s second publication was

                            The responsibility and authority for the splitting and revision of the poem are unknown. As the editors of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> speculate, 
                            the revision presumably was guided either by the magazine&#x02BC;s editor,

                            Subsequent scholars have weighted the responsibility on the father&#x02BC;s side 
                            (see, e.g., <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MAIDMENTONLYPRINT">Maidment, &#x201C;&#x2018;Only Print&#x2019;&#x201D;</ref>, 196), 
                            but in fact no evidence survives to document the process of revision.</p>
                        <p>Whoever was responsible, the <title type="poem" corresp="#JRLINESCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines Written at the Lakes in Cumberland&#x201D;</title> was formed by isolating 
                            the final strophe of the original poem, which in the <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title></ref> 
                            draft was designated by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> as the &#x201C;conclusion&#x201D; (beginning &#x201C;sweet derwent on thy winding shore.&#x201D;), 
                            and which is distinct from main body of the poem for its rhymed couplets.
                            (In the fair copy, contained in <ref type="apparatus" target="battle_of_waterloo_ms_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#BATTLEOFWATERLOOMS">&#x201C;Battle of Waterloo, A Play, in Two Acts, with Other Small Poems, Dedicated to His Father&#x201D;</title></ref>,
                            this concluding section is not subtitled, but it is marked by a horizontal bar above its first line.) 
                            The choice of these ten concluding lines as the first, separate publication can be explained by the revised dating of the poem. 
                            The Ruskins engaged <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> to tutor <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> starting in <date when="1829-04">April 1829</date>, 
                            only about five months prior to the <date when="1829-08">August</date> publication of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRLINESCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines&#x201D;</title> 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 200); and presumably <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> 
                            would not have seen <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s original poem prior to its presentation to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> 
                            on his <date when="1829-05-10">10 May</date> birthday. Thus, only a few months elapsed between when <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> 
                            likely first read the poem and when he would have needed to oversee its revision and printing. There was not enough time for revision of 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s entire original poem for the <date when="1829-08">August</date> publication date, 
                            although <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> apparently was so struck by the work that he decided to hurry the brief &#x201C;Lines&#x201D; into the soonest available issue.</p>
                        <p>There was time enough, however, for several minor revisions and one major development of the text as found in both the 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title></ref> draft and the fair copy presented in

                            The major change lies in the elaborated conclusion of the <title type="poem" corresp="#JRLINESCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines&#x201D;</title>,

                            an additional moralizing couplet, which has no basis at all in the original, deprives the Poet of solace in nature: 
                            &#x201C;Though such thy glories Earth, thy proudest whole, / Can never satiate the grasping soul!&#x201D;</p>

                            and perhaps the <date when="1829-08">August 1829</date> issue was missing even by the <date notBefore="1840" notAfter="1849">1840s</date>,

                            see below, <ref type="internal" target="#REDISCOVERY">The Rediscovery of Ruskin&#x02BC;s First Publication</ref>.) Thus, lacking copytext from a published source,

                            By <date when="1893">1893</date>, however, he had made up for this oversight, describing both the poem and the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#BATTLEOFWATERLOOMS">&#x201C;Waterloo&#x201D;</title> booklet in

                        <p>It is a coincidence that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> decided, like the <persName corresp="#EA">Reverend Andrews</persName>, to divide

                            <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> probably got the idea to divide the poem from an accidental feature of the

                            the section that he separated out and entitled <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSKIDDAW1891">&#x201C;Skiddaw&#x201D;</title> happens to precede the prose fragment,

                            which interrupts the sequential composition of the poem; 
                            and the section that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> entitled <title type="poem" corresp="#JRDERWENTWATER1891">&#x201C;Derwentwater&#x201D;</title> 
                            follows the prose fragment, with the resumption of composition declared by a short form of the poem&#x02BC;s title, &#x201C;skiddaw derwent water.&#x201D; 
                            In this segmenting of the draft, there is no indication that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intended separate poems, although the interruption 
                            the prose fragment does occur at a clear point of transition, signaled by the line, &#x201C;Now derwent water come a looking glass&#x201D;.</p>

                            which was apparently unavailable to <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> when editing <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)</title>, 
                            the editors of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> were able to publish <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s

                            As copytext for the main reading version of the poem, however, the editors, <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>, 
                            adopted the <date when="1830-02">February 1830</date> <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title> version,

                            that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> provided and yet himself neglected from <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s

                            The editors did not print <title type="poem" corresp="#JRLINESCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines Written at the Lakes in Cumberland&#x201D;</title> 
                            from the <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title>, showing like <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> 
                            no awareness of the existence of that earlier publication. The editors also printed the complete text of the fair&#x2010;copy version from the 
                            <title type="manuscript" corresp="#BATTLEOFWATERLOOMS">&#x201C;Waterloo&#x201D;</title> booklet, but they dropped this text into a note; moreover, they annotated 
                            this text of the fair&#x2010;copy version with a comparison to <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s versions,

                            The editors remark that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> based his versions on &#x201C;the somewhat illegible draft&#x201D; in 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title></ref>, but, when noting variants, the editors 
                            fail to make clear to the reader that the variants included some of the numerous omissions and editorial interventions introduced by <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> 
                            and not necessarily true variants between the draft and fair&#x2010;copy texts (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 2:265&#x2013;68).</p>
                        <p>Thus, while <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> brought the publishing history of

                            they added confusion to the compositional history, even as they presented new materials for that history. In addition to their conflation of the texts of 
                            <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s versions and of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title> version, 
                            as if they were discussing the same text, <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> 
                            introduced numerous silent editorial changes of their own into their texts of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title> version,

                        <p>As a final contribution to these representations of textual history, <persName corresp="#ETC">E. T. Cook</persName> saw fit to cobble together yet another version,

                            <persName corresp="#HRN">Nicoll</persName> implies, however, that he found the <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title> 
                            by following his own clue&#x2014;namely, the Ruskin family&#x02BC;s connections with <persName corresp="#EA">Edward Andrews</persName>:

                        <p>The cul de sac of <persName corresp="#HRN">Nicoll</persName>&#x02BC;s scholarship is striking in view of the phenomenon of the

                            which prompted keen rivalries for obtaining &#x201C;early editions&#x201D; of modern authors at high prices on the rare book market. Two circumstances may have blunted 
                            <persName corresp="#HRN">Nicoll</persName>&#x02BC;s coup from causing its due sensation. First, two years earlier, in <date when="1893">1893</date>,

                            was <date when="1834-03">March 1834</date> prose piece for the <title type="periodical" corresp="#MAGAZINEOFNATURALHISTORY">Magazine of Natural History</title>, the

                            and the bibliography identified <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s first published <hi rend="italic">poem</hi> as

                            Second, <persName corresp="#HRN">Nicoll</persName>&#x02BC;s correction to the bibliography perhaps never gained traction owing to the excessive rarity of the

                            To document his find, <persName corresp="#HRN">Nicoll</persName> had to seek help from the Andrews family: &#x201C;Through the kindness of 
                            <persName corresp="#EA">Dr. Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s granddaughter, [the lawyer and social activist] Miss <persName corresp="#EO">Eliza Orme</persName> [1848&#x2013;1937],

                            Curiously, when <persName corresp="#JSD">James S. Dearden</persName> repeated <persName corresp="#HRN">Nicoll</persName>&#x02BC;s discovery a century later, 
                            he repeated history by in a sense relying on the Andrews family: his research was prompted by a bound copy of the

                        made his most ambitious effort to date to engage with the conventions of the picturesque, which first appears in the juvenilia of <date when="1827">1827</date>, 
                        when he gathered poems into a small anthology that he entitled 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;Poetry Discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                        That he was consciously writing the present poem in the same mode is implicit in his original title,

                        It is less clear, however, whether he derived materials for the poem from the picturesque journeying. The poems in 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;Poetry Discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref> 
                        originated from a family tour in <date when="1827">1827</date> to <placeName corresp="#WALES">Wales</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>, 
                        whereas the editors of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> believed that

                        Arguments for dating and mapping the early family journeys have tended to work in circles, with <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s dateable poems 
                        about locales cited as evidence for the journeys that are used to contextualize those very poems. In the present instance, as argued in

                        (As also argued, it is possible that an alleged <date when="1826">1826</date> northern journey might not have occurred at all, but may be a mistaken reference

                    <p>Biographically, perhaps the most significant influence on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s composition of his poem was a journey that definitely

                    <p>Thus, in wrapping <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s playful topographical poem in a casing, as it were, of conventionally otherworldly piety, the revised 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRLINESCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines Written at the Lakes in Cumberland. &#x007C; <hi rend="italic">Derwentwater</hi>&#x201D;</title> and

                        in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title>, only called to mind what a closely knit circle of suburban evangelical 
                        households already knew about the deep mourning that had thwarted the Ruskins&#x02BC; anticipated picturesque pleasures of <geogName corresp="#SKIDDAW"> Mount Skiddaw</geogName> 
                        and <geogName corresp="#DERWENT">Derwent Water</geogName>&#x2014;a mournfulness that should not be lost even in the anticipation of recouping that pleasure. 
                        This understanding nonetheless did not lighten <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s struggle with revising the poem.</p>
                    <p>What was the status of <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s short&#x2010;lived <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title>? 
                        In its first issue, the journal announced itself as a &#x201C;sprightly and elegant&#x201D; production that would &#x201C;break out of the trammels in which other religious 
                        periodicals seem proud to confine themselves, and show that even piety may be connected with high talent, and that vulgarity of style is not inseparable 
                        with what are foolishly called high doctrines, and dulness from what more sober persons call Evangelical&#x201D; (quoted in 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#NICOLLFIRSTPUBLISHEDWRITINGS">Nicoll, &#x201C;First Published Writings of Mr. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x201D;</ref>). 
                        The tone matches what <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> remarked as <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s signature &#x201C;expressions&#x201D; of 
                        &#x201C;almost but not quite&#x201D; and of appearing &#x201C;best when he frowns next when he laughs and next when he neither frowns nor laughs.&#x201D; 
                        The characterization suggests the phenomenon of miscellaneity that <persName corresp="#DSCRITIC">David Stewart</persName> has remarked in the 
                        <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> magazine culture of the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, 
                        as a conviction of knowledge as &#x201C;contained within a single intellectual structure&#x201D; was relinquished for an idea of knowledge as 
                        &#x201C;divided between a large number of distinct divisions&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#STEWARTROMANTICMAGAZINES">Stewart, <hi rend="italic">Romantic Magazines and Metropolitan Literary Culture</hi></ref>, 5). 
                        It is possible that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intended the handmade pamphlet, <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title></ref>, 
                        to reflect this eclectic magazine culture, combining, as it does, poems and sermons, an Edgeworthian lesson and a religious piece entitled "a theme", a start on a play, 
                        and letters to family and friends as if corresponding with a subscribership.</p>
                    <p>In avoiding the pitfalls of sectarianism and the reputaton of Nonconformists for stiff&#x2010;necked resistence to the worldliness of learning and cultivation, 
                        the journal&#x02BC;s mission appears comparable to that of the more successful Congregational magazine, the <title type="periodical" corresp="#ECLECTICREVIEW"><hi rend="italic">Eclectic Review</hi></title> 
                        (1805&#x2013;68), which likewise stood for a broad cultivation of literature combined with evangelical seriousness. In the <title type="periodical" corresp="#ECLECTICREVIEW"><hi rend="italic">Eclectic</hi></title>&#x02BC;s 
                        first years, regular contributors included the essayist, <persName corresp="#JFOSTER">John Foster</persName> (1770&#x2013;1843), and the poet, 
                        <persName corresp="#JMPOET">James Montgomery</persName> (1771&#x2013;1854). Theologically and politically, the <title type="periodical" corresp="#ECLECTICREVIEW"><hi rend="italic">Eclectic</hi></title> 
                        sought to bridge the gap between Dissent and Establishment&#x2014;an &#x201C;eclectic&#x201D; stance that the journal itself proved unable to maintain, 
                        driven eventually to promoting more decisively Nonconformist interests of civic and religious liberty 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HILLERECLECTICREVIEW">Hiller, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Eclectic Review</hi>&#x201D;</ref>, 179&#x2013;86). 
                        <persName corresp="#DSCRITIC">David Stewart</persName> proposes that Romantic magazines, rather than becoming trapped in bunkered positions as culture fissured into 
                        competing disciplines and positions, sought a heterogeneous audience who in turn positioned itself in relation to a magazine culture and not just a single organ of opinion 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#STEWARTROMANTICMAGAZINES">Stewart, <hi rend="italic">Romantic Magazines and Metropolitan Literary Culture</hi></ref>, 7&#x2013;8). 
                        The growing predicament of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#ECLECTICREVIEW"><hi rend="italic">Eclectic</hi></title> illustrates how precarious an 
                        &#x201C;almost but not quite&#x201D; demeanor could prove in the turbulent period of reform. The <title type="periodical" corresp="#PATRIOT"><hi rend="italic">Patriot</hi></title> (1832&#x2013;66), 
                        another heterogeneous periodical operated jointly by interests of <orgName corresp="#CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalists</orgName> and <orgName corresp="#BAPTISM">Baptists</orgName>, 
                        struggled to build adequate support on a nationwide subscriber base of Dissenters who upheld loyalty to voluntaryism on the question of Church Establishment, 
                        but who shrank from identifying with radical Dissent. The newspaper&#x02BC;s trustees turned to the experienced journalist, <persName corresp="#JCEDITOR">Josiah Conder</persName> (1789&#x2013;1855), 
                        already editor of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#ECLECTICREVIEW"><hi rend="italic">Eclectic Review</hi></title>, to increase subscription, 
                        but the <title type="periodical" corresp="#PATRIOT"><hi rend="italic">Patriot</hi></title> nonetheless almost foundered along with its editor 
                        because <persName corresp="#JCEDITOR">Conder</persName> was perceived as too soft on the question of Establishment even in the view of moderates, 
                        must less of the radical voluntaryists (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#COOPERPATRIOT">Cooper, &#x201C;Dissenters and National Journalism&#x201D;</ref>). 
                        Given that the weekly <title type="periodical" corresp="#PATRIOT"><hi rend="italic">Patriot</hi></title> and monthly <title type="periodical" corresp="#ECLECTICREVIEW"><hi rend="italic">Eclectic</hi></title> 
                        survived only by virtue of deft political and theological positioning, not to mention the hugely energetic labors of professional journalists like <persName corresp="#JCEDITOR">Conder</persName>, 
                        no wonder that the modest <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title> failed to summon adequate support. Add to this 
                        the scale of the competition, with four thousand journal titles estimated to have been founded in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> 
                        <date notBefore="1790" notAfter="1832">between 1790 and 1832</date>, and <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> was soon forced to shut down the costly venture 
                        within the first year of his magazine&#x02BC;s publication

                    <p>The ephemerality of <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>&#x02BC;s journal may account for the relative unimportance that the Ruskins appear to have attached to 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s first publication. Yet, while the Ruskins would seek loftier venues for <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        subsequent boyhood publications, a feature of this first effort persisted in the family&#x02BC;s tendency to gravitate to publishers with whom they could establish 
                        a personal connection such as a shared Scottish heritage. In about four years, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s two poems in the 
                        <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title> would be almost forgotten, dimmed by the splendor surrounding the appearance of his poems,

                        (the latter complemented by a vedute of the city, engraved in steel), in the highly popular annual

                        and the contribution of his prose piece, <ref type="apparatus" target="enquiries_on_the_causes_of_the_colour_of_the_water_of_the_rhine_apparatus.php"><title type="essay" corresp="#JRENQUIRIES">&#x201C;Enquiries on the Causes of the Colour of the Water of the Rhine&#x201D;</title></ref>,

                        Nonetheless, leading up to these publications, the Ruskins sought the mentorship of men of letters who, while more celebrated than <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>, 
                        had like him visited the Ruskins&#x02BC; suburban home, <placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName>&#x2014;the poet and editor,

                        <persName corresp="#AE">Alexander Elder</persName> (1790&#x2013;1876). All were Scotsmen; and <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName>&#x02BC;s publishing firm, 
                        <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>, even employed <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cousin,

                        also personal acquaintances would help to shape the literary persona known as <persName type="pen_name">&#x201C;J.R.&#x201D;</persName>, which had already gotten his start as 
                        <persName type="pen_name">&#x201C;R.&#x201D;</persName> in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title>.</p>
                    <p>In <date when="1829">1829</date>, not only could the Ruskins claim personal connections with <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName>, but the 
                        <placeName corresp="#WALWORTH">Walworth</placeName> preacher could impress them with his own share of fame. He was a rising star in the metropolitan pulpit, 
                        an eloquent and popular clergyman whose dashing appearance commanded no fewer than a dozen painted, engraved, and sculpted portraits in his lifetime 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ANSTRUTHERCOVENTRYPATMORESANGEL">Anstruther, <hi rend="italic">Coventry Patmore&#x02BC;s Angel</hi></ref>, 123&#x2013;24). 
                        &#x201C;What a nice face he has,&#x201C; commented the young <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName>. Yet, unlike the distinguished Scotsmen who ushered 
                        <persName type="pen_name">&#x201C;J.R.&#x201D;</persName> into the limelight in <date notBefore="1834" notAfter="1835">1834&#x2013;35</date>, 
                        <persName corresp="#EA">Andrews</persName> fell from grace. Perhaps the main discouragement to giving <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s first 
                        publication its full due was the pronouncement by the elder Ruskins in <date when="1831">1831</date> that, while &#x201C;the Dr. has wonderful talents . . . 
                        he is certainly fighty&#x201D; and on his way to compromising &#x201C;his respectability and fortune and prevent[ing] his filling that place in society his talents entitle him to&#x201D;

                        It must have seemed intolerable that the literary birth of <persName type="pen_name">&#x201C;J.R.&#x201D;</persName> could have been attended by anything less than 
                        the most solid assurances of success, much less the want of respectability.</p>
