                    defines as &#x201C;A glistering; a bright light, brilliance, lustre.&#x201D; For the verb form of the word, the dictionary cites an <date when="1808">1808</date> example, 
                    which would have been well known to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, from <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>, 
                    <hi rend="italic">Marmion</hi> (book 2, stanza 21):

                    the attraction of viewing the battlefield of <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName> had become &#x201C;&#x2018;somewhat musty,&#x2019; and decidedly out of fashion,&#x201D; 
                    according to Frances Trollope. Despite nearly two decades elapsing since the battle, however, Trollope admits that 
                    &#x201C;all my English feelings were as much awakened at the idea of seeing [the battlefield] as if its glory had arisen but yesterday,&#x201D; 
                    and she gives a moving account of the experience
