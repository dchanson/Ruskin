                Â   <name><persName corresp="#JR">by John Ruskin</persName></name></head>  
                <p>How lightly the waves of the broad <geogName corresp="#MEUSE">Meuse</geogName> crisped with the first breath 
                    of the morning, as we swept over the long bridge that crosses the river 
                    from <placeName corresp="#NAMUR">Namur</placeName>, and looked back on the rich dome of its small but beautiful 
                    cathedral, as it began to smile to the first glance of the joyous sun, that 
                    was drinking up the delicate mists which clung to the hills, and rested on 
                    the valley, in which the fair city reposed so peacefully&#x2014;and then we 
                    dashed along the valley of the <geogName corresp="#MEUSE">Meuse</geogName>. I know not if it was because this 
                    was our first initiation in to the scenery of Continental rivers, but this 
                    part of the <geogName corresp="#MEUSE">Meuse</geogName> appeared to me infinitely preferable (not in point of 
                    sublimity or beauty, but in that romantic and picturesque fairy beauty 
                    which is, in many cases, superior to either) to anything which I ever after&#x2010; 
                    wards saw on the shores of the far famed <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>.</p> 
                    
                <p>There was, to me, a great sameness throughout the whole of the course 
                    of the latter river; and, for its fortresses, it is positively too much of a 
                    good thing&#x2014;a tiresome repetition of ruins, and ruins too which do not 
                    altogether agree with my idea of what ruins ought to be. But for the 
                    <geogName corresp="#MEUSE">Meuse</geogName>&#x2014;the infinite variety of scenery, the impossibility of seeing every 
                    successive change as you feel that it ought to be seen&#x2014;and, finally, the 
                    tantalizing rate at which you dash away from that which you could feast 
                    upon, and look upon, and dwell upon, for&#x2014;ages, I was going to say, 
                    months, I will say, are enough to enchant you with anything. If you<pb/>
                    wish to see rock scenery in perfection, go to the <geogName corresp="#MEUSE">Meuse</geogName>,<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> for never were 
                    rocks more beautifully disposed, more richly and delicately wooded, or 
                    more finely contrasted with the amazing richness of the surrounding 
                    scenery. But, alas! it was but a forenoon ride, and the eve saw us quit 
                    the magnificent <geogName corresp="#MEUSE">Meuse</geogName> with sorrow, for the smoky streets and coal wharfs 
                    of <placeName corresp="#LIEGE">Li&#x00E8;ge</placeName>, and the round, dumpy, shapeless hills of <placeName corresp="#SPA">Spa</placeName>.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></p>

                    enforced. See especially <emph>Letters to William Ward</emph> (letter of <date when="1867-09-08">Sept 8, 1867</date>), whom he 
                    sent in that year for a sketching tour on the <geogName corresp="#MEUSE">Meuse</geogName>, in company with <persName corresp="#GA">Mr. George Allen</persName>.] </p>
