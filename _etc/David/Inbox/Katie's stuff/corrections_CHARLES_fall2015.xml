                        a cluster detailing the experience of physically crossing the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>, he drafted poems unquestionably connected with nearly every title, and he drafted them 
                        in the same sequence as the titles appear in the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan</title>. 
                        And again, to develop the trope of mountain crossing, he drew on various aspects of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s influence:</p>
                    
                    <p>The draft poem connected with the first title, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title>, is particularly rich

                        (see the contextual glosses for <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title>).</p>
                    
                    <p>By selecting only the one historical example of <persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName>&#x02BC;s crossing for elaboration, however, from the several with which <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> crowds <title type="poem" corresp="ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</title>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> demonstrates a tendency to expand and attenuate what <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> presents as layers of memory and history. 
                        On the one hand, by positioning his <persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName> poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title>, 
                        as a fulcrum between sections about approaching the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> and sections about crossing the mountains, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> acknowledges <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s procedure of concentrating and multiplying perspectives. 
                        In <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</title>, the speaker describes multiple viewpoints, 
                        first recalling his approach to the mountains from below, in western <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName> (<persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> begins <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> in <placeName corresp="#LAKEGENEVA">Lake Geneva</placeName> and environs) 
                        and then gazing over a wide prospect from above&#x2014;retracing the winding road that he has climbed, and anticipating the path that he will follow to descend 
                        into <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>. </p>
                    
                    <p>The <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan</title> does not make clear whether <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                        meant these titles to refer to composite sections, or to individual pieces, some of which he had already composed, but we can only assume 
                        that he intended to maintain the composite design of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>. For this cluster of titles, 
                        the extant individual draft pieces that, in their content, most likely correspond to the proposed composite sections include the poem,

                        and which is suggestive of the title given in the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan</title> as 
                        <title type="composite" corresp="#JRSWISSCOTTAGESCOMP">&#x201C;The swiss cottages&#x201D;</title>. (It was then common, if inaccurate, 
                        to characterize <geogName corresp="#BLACKFOREST">Black Forest</geogName> peasant houses as &#x201C;Swiss&#x201D;.) This poem was drafted in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, 
                        where it is followed by a prose fragment, <ref type="witness" target="it_was_a_wide_and_stretchy_sweep_prose_msviii.php"><title type="essay" corresp="#JRITWASAWIDESTRETCHYSWEEP">&#x201C;It was a wide stretchy sweep of lovely blue champaign&#x201D;</title></ref>,

                    <p>In context of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan</title>, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title> 
                        can be viewed structurally either as a pivot between the two clusters&#x2014;that on the first distant sighting of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>, 
                        and the cluster on crossing the mountains into <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>&#x2014;or the poem can be regarded as the first piece 
                        in the series relating the physical crossing. It should be borne in mind that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> composed the poem earlier than and separately from the other poems 
                        about mountain crossing. In its original context, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG2">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</title>, 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title> was situated between the prose essay, 
                        <title type="essay" corresp="#JRCALAISPROSE">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</title>, and the poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRMILANCATHEDRAL">&#x201C;Milan Cathedral&#x201D;</title>

                            as compared with the few "fragments" published in 1834 and 1850. To summarize, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> limited his edition to verse, 
                            whereas <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> were the first to represent 
                            the work as composite in genre, albeit curtailing reproduction of the drawings. Both editions, however, sought to complete the work beyond the version in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>, 
                            which Ruskin abandoned in the middle of fair-copying the section on "Heidelberg". Cook and Wedderburn's reconstruction relied heavily on Collingwood's for the conjectural ordering 
                            of the poems and essays that Ruskin left in draft, although the 1903 edition not only rejoined the poems that Collingwood had edited with their complementary prose essays, 
                            but also rescued poems and essays about places along the tour that Collingwood had neglected altogether.</p>
                        <p>For <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>, it was necessary to restore the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> 
                            to some degree of integrity in order to justify publishing the fragmentary work at all, given the conditions placed on his edition (probably by Ruskin himself, but Collingwood does not identify the source) 
                            of omitting "poems and passages as were either without general interest, or incomplete and inadequately representative of the author's attainments and style 
                            at the time" of composition. In <title type="book" corresp="JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, the author had rejected 
                            the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> as an &#x201C;unfinished folly&#x201D;, 
                            which "none but friends" should ever see. Collingwood interpreted this embargo as referring, "not to the literary quality of the verse"--the first condition 
                            for inclusion in an edition of the poetry--"but to the miscalculation and miscarriage of an ambitious project", thus stigmatizing the work on the grounds 
                            of the second condition. In defense, Collingwood pleaded for reconstructing the work from the &#x201C;rough copies&#x201D; of poems, 
                            which he was &#x201C;pretty certain . . . [<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>] was not aware of&#x201D; lying &#x201C;at the back of his book&#x2010;shelves&#x201D;

                            base text; and while they expanded the edited text to include prose and at least a facsimilie of one drawing along with notes describing the remaining drawings, 
                            the later editors never fundamentally questioned Collingwood's framework or his editorial assumptions.</p>

                            Collingwood's assumptions guiding his editorial approach to the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> were more biographical 
                            than literary, as indeed he introduced the entire edition of <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> as revealing "the ground-plan of [Ruskin's] character,--the 
                            bias of his mental development" (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS8D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>; 1:xx;

                            He regarded the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> 
                            as documentary evidence for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s narrative about the tour in <title type="book" corresp="JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, 
                            as he indicated adding quotations from that narrative as epigraphs to the work as a whole and to some individual poems. 
                            Collingwood did not complete the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, as he knew to be impossible. 
                            He was acquainted with the <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php"><title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan for Continuation</title></ref> 
                            that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> compiled on the back endpapers of MS VIII--"I find from a list at the end of No. VIII" that Ruskin "intended this volume 
                            to contain about 150 pieces of prose and poetry, and at least as many drawings!--but he was concerned only to use the draft poems to bring the reader to closure 
                            as a record of the tour, with Ruskin's impressions of Chamounix. He did not treat the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan for Continuation</title> 
                            as an authoritative constraint on how he arranged and even entitled the draft poems that he used to round out the work.</p>
                        
                        <p>Clearly, Collingwood did not consider himself bound by titles in the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan</title> 
                            for pieces that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did not fair-copy, even though a case could be made that corresponding draft, titled and untitled, 
                            could be identified. Collingwood instead invented titles that more effectively  Of course, one can argue that literary features 
                            of the "Account" influenced the narrative in Praeterita, but Collingwood stated that the latter possessed "a power of recollective imagination resembling Turner," 
                            while the use of the former was to document that "the account of the tour of Praeterita [is not] quite accurate," because, for example, "the travellers 
                            went to the west of Switzerland and the Oberland after being in Italy"

                            in his retitling of the draft poems, since their content can be associated with various titles in the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan</title>.

                            connect with three titles in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s list: <title type="composite" corresp="#JRSCHAFFHAUSENCOMP">&#x201C;Schaffhausen&#x201D;</title>, 
                            <title type="composite" corresp="#JRTHEALPSCOMP">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</title>, and <title type="composite" corresp="#JRFALLOFTHERHINECOMP">&#x201C;The Fall of the Rhine&#x201D;</title> 
                            (see the textual and contextual glosses to these poems). But the more significant connection between this draft poem and the titles in the list is the clue 
                            that the poem provides to the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan for Continuation of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> 
                            as a literary design, and not just a sequential list of places visited during the tour. </p>
                        <p>Collingwood, intent on presenting the "Account" more as a record of the 1833 tour than as Ruskin's literary and artistic apprenticeship (or, perhaps better said, 
                            assuming those two purposes to be identical), omitted the tale of Gough and his dog from "The Summit," presumably because he was offended by the intrusion of a Lake District 
                            story into an account of a Continental tour. On the same principle of treating the "Account" as a diary rather than as a literary construction, 
                            he misplaced <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title>, relegating it to the end of the sequence--between 
                            the poems about Italy and those about the finale of the tour, Chamounix in Switzerland--rather 
                            than where Ruskin's <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan for Continuation of the Account</title> explicitly 
                            situates the poem, as a preface to the series about crossing the Alps at Splugen. Collingwood's logic is clear enough: <persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName> 
                            descended on Italy through the western Alpine approach, the <geogName corresp="#SIMPLON">Simplon</geogName>, not the northern; however, such geographical and historical literalism misses the point of Ruskin's engagement 
                            with writers and artists in the "Account." Arguably, in situating <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title> as an introduction 
                            to Chamounix, Collingwood fulfilled Ruskin's idea, apparent in the Plan, to complement the series about crossing the Alps from the north with a reverse poetic series 
                            describing the crossing from the east in Italy:</p>
                        <p>Given Collingwood's indifference to the Plan, however, he evidence suggests that his approximation of Ruskins' intention was a happy accident.</p>
