                <p>Alas! every article of this treaty was strictly fulfilled with regard to us, 
                    and the consequence was, that in a six hours&#x02BC; ride of twelve miles, I was

                    its white fretted marble columns looking out from the dark retiring 
                    immensity of the long aisles, and the faint streams of coloured and variegated 
                    light falling faintly through the Gothic windows, streaming at 
                    intervals along the chequered floors, or ruddily lighting up the countenances 
                    of the marble figures, giving a ghastly resemblance to reality, a mockery of 
                    life, that makes you start when you look upon the hollow eyes and rigid 
                    muscles starting out of the stone. You almost think that the dead forms 
                    of departed monarchs have sprung forth from their narrow dwellings
                    <pb/>
                    beneath that ancient pavement, and that the peers of Charlemagne are
