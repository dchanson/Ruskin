                <p>And this is our last excursion on <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Swiss</placeName> ground, thought I, scanning 
                    the provoking clouds that ever rolled massively among the regions of 
                    eternal snow, though far above the blue mountains that encircle their 
                    mighty monarch.<ref type="gloss" target="chamouni_glosses_contextual.php#MCLIFFYDIADEMGLOSS"/> I have always a sort of kindred feeling for these 
                    beautiful blue hills; they ever look half <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">English</placeName>, and I love them for it. 
                    They may not be so wonderful, so majestic, so mighty, or so beautiful, but<pb/>
                    they are more like home, sweet home, and it is pleasant, very pleasant, to 
                    meet a friend in a foreign land. We are going to <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</placeName>, <hi rend="italic">c&#x02BC;est vrai</hi>, 
                    but it seems exceeding strange. Before we left home, I had read of 
                    <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</placeName>, heard of <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</placeName>, and seen some few drawings of <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</placeName>, 
                    but never so much as dreamed of going to <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</placeName>, it seemed so un&#x2010;come&#x2010;at&#x2010;able; 
                    and for the <geogName corresp="#MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</geogName>, it seemed in another world, in fairy&#x2010;land, 
                    and of course had a magic halo thrown round it, an &#x00E6;therialness 
                    that can never be joined with reality. That halo comes again on looking 
                    back. And this is our last excursion on <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Swiss</placeName> ground, thought I, the 
                    last, and the wildest, and the sweetest, because&#x2014;because, perhaps it is 
                    the last. The day was exceedingly favourable for the scenery of the 
                    lower mountains, not for the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>; they were reserved for other times. 
                    The noon verged gradually from burning sunshine<ref type="gloss" target="chamouni_prose_glosses_textual.php#SHINESHINEGLOSS"/> to thick thundery 
                    clouds, that rolled rapidly over the murky heaven as we entered a solitary 
                    mountain recess, a cliffy defile, leading from the valley of <placeName corresp="#MAGLAND">Maglan</placeName> to that 
                    of <placeName corresp="#SALLANCHES">Salenches</placeName>.<ref type="gloss" target="chamouni_glosses_contextual.php#MAGLANTOSALLANCHESGLOSS"/> Down they burst with a fierce rattling turmoil and headlong 
                    flash, flash, flashing, and the bridleless clouds careered along the crags at 
                    such a wild rate that their own speed broke them into scattered confusion, 
                    that the blue sky shone calmly through their openings, and the labouring 
                    sun struggled strangely&#x2014;now gleaming waterily on the red&#x2010;ribbed skeleton 
                    crags, now mingling with the quiver of the lightning, now again plunged 
                    into the swift rack of the thunder&#x2010;clouds that seemed sweeping round the 
                    mountain summits like lashed ocean waves round a labouring vessel. The 
                    <geogName corresp="#ARVE">Arve</geogName> swelled on the instant, and his turbid waves tore madly down, trees, 
                    stones, rocks, all tost along the channel, by the arrowy force of that 
                    resistless river, ever mighty, but now fearful. As the sun verged towards 
                    the horizon, the clouds swept partially away; the hills, the cliffs, the 
                    mountains, the rocks, and the blue vaulted sky glowed with his last rays 
                    for a moment; he sunk and the night came, his darkness made yet more 
                    visible by the thunder gloom of the storm.</p> 
                
                <p>&#x201C;Voil&#x00E0; les aiguilles,&#x201D; quoth our char&#x2010;&#x00E0;&#x2010;banc driver. If any person in 
                    the whole world is totally insensible to pain, knocks, aches, and bruises, it 
                    must be a <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Swiss</placeName> char&#x2010;&#x00E0;&#x2010;banc driver. The <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Swiss</placeName> char&#x2010;&#x00E0;&#x2010;banc is a vehicle 
                    expressly built for the purpose of passing over those roads, which no 
                    other species of conveyance can pass over twelve yards of without immediate 
                    demolition. It is a sort of large side&#x2010;saddle, capable of containing, if 
                    well packed, three pauvres miserables, with a back and roof to it, and a 
                    board to put the feet on, with a leather to keep you in, all which are of 
                    a most ancient and venerable description; this is fixed totally without 
                    springs or anything of the kind, as far as I could see, upon four wheels, 
                    et voil&#x00E0; un char&#x2010;&#x00E0;&#x2010;banc. With this kind of vehicle, upon roads which 
                    always resemble and are often carried through the beds of tumbling 
                    mountain torrents, any one may easily imagine the sort of pleasurable 
                    penance to which he is subjected who submits to be driven from <placeName corresp="#SALLANCHES">Salenches</placeName> 
                    up to <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</placeName> in a char&#x2010;&#x00E0;&#x2010;banc.</p>
                
                <p>&#x201C;Voil&#x00E0; les aiguilles,&#x201D; quoth our char&#x2010;&#x00E0;&#x2010;banc driver.<ref type="gloss" target="chamouni_glosses_contextual.php#VOILAGLOSS"/> How I started, 
                    I believe I was dreaming of home at the time; it is odd you always think<pb/>
                    it would be very pleasant to be where you are not; it can&#x02BC;t be helped, but 
                    it is very provoking, the charms of a place always increase in geometrical 
                    ratio as you get farther from it, and therefore &#x02BC;tis a rich pleasure to look 
                    back on anything, though it has a dash of regret. It is singular that 
                    almost all pleasure is past, or coming. Well, I looked up, and lo! seven 
                    thousand feet above me soared the needles of <geogName corresp="#MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</geogName>, splintered and 
                    crashed and shivered, the marks of the tempest for three score centuries, 
                    yet they are here, shooting up red, bare, scarcely even lichened, entirely 
                    inaccessible, snowless, the very snow cannot cling to the down&#x2010;plunging 
                    sheerness of these terrific flanks that rise pre&#x2010;eminently dizzying and 
                    beetling above the sea of wreathed snow that rolled its long surging waves 
                    over the summits of the lower and less precipitous mountains. Then came 
                    the stretching gloominess of the pine forests, jagging darkly upon the 
                    ridge of every crag, strangely contrasted with the cold blueness of the 
                    peaky glaciers that filled the huge ravines between the hills, descending 
                    like the bursting billows of a chafed ocean tide from the desolate dominion 
                    of the snow, and curling forward till they lay on the green fields of 
                    <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</placeName>, which stretched away, one unbroken line of luxuriance, till 
                    bounded by the lonely desertness of the <placeName corresp="#COLDEBALME">Col de Balme</placeName>.<ref type="gloss" target="chamouni_glosses_contextual.php#COLDEBALMEGLOSS"/> There is not 
                    another scene like <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</placeName> throughout all <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName>. In no other 
                    spot that I have seen is the rich luxuriance of the cultivated valley, the 
                    flashing splendour of the eternal snow, the impending magnificence of the 
                    bare, spiry crag, and the strange, cold rigidity of the surgy glaciers so 
                    dreadfully and beautifully combined, There is silence unbroken, no 
                    thunder of the avalanche comes crashing from the recesses of the hills, 
                    there is no voice from the chasmy glacier, no murmur from the thousand 
                    mountain streams, you are in solitude, a strange unearthly solitude, but 
                    you feel as if the air were full of spirits.<ref type="gloss" target="chamouni_glosses_contextual.php#SPIRITSMONTBLANCGLOSS"/></p>
