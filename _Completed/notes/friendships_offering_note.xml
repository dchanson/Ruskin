                        According to the bibliography of the annuals,

                    </p>
                    <p>In the wake of <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s outstanding success, <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi> was published 
                        by <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Lupton Relfe</persName>, a bookseller in <placeName corresp="#CORNHILL">Cornhill</placeName>. According to an <date when="1858">1858</date> reflection on the heyday of annuals, 
                        <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>&#x02BC;s product was &#x201C;unpromising&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ANNUALSOFFORMERDAYS">&#x201C;The Annuals of Former Days&#x201D;</ref>, 496), 
                        although this judgment may be colored by the annual&#x02BC;s subsequent success under a new publisher. 
                        That there was some upheaval afoot appears evident from the prefatory remarks by the new editor for the <date when="1826">1826</date> volume, <persName corresp="#TKH">T. K. Hervey</persName> (<date notBefore="1799" notAfter="1859">1799&#x2013;1859</date>), 
                        who acknowledges &#x201C;difficulties&#x201D; arising from the annual having, &#x201C;very recently, come into the present Editor&#x02BC;s hands 
                        with a view to an entire change in its character and plan&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliiography" target="bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><persName corresp="#TKH">Hervey</persName>, ed., <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1826"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> [<date when="1826">1826</date>]</ref>, v). 
                        In any case, in <date when="1827">1827</date> the annual was taken over by the relatively young publishing firm of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>.
                    </p> 
                    <p><orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> released their first volume of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> &#x201C;for&#x201D; <date when="1828">1828</date>, under the editorship of <persName corresp="#CK">Charles Knight</persName> (<date notBefore="1791" notAfter="1873">1791&#x2013;1873</date>), 
                        who was then struggling to establish himself in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> publishing. 
                        <persName corresp="#CK">Knight</persName> was succeeded in the following year by <persName corresp="#TP">Thomas Pringle</persName>&#x2014;the editor who would later introduce <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to the fashionable world as the author, &#x201C;<persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">J.R.</persName>&#x201D;
                        <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> strikingly improved the annual&#x02BC;s material appeal, and 
                        sales rose, eventually peaking at ten thousand copies per year 
                        (by comparison, <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT" rend="italic">Forget Me Not</title> in some years achieved twenty thousand). The fortunes of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> were assured 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SMITHDNB"><persName corresp="#BBELL">Bell</persName>, <title type="dictionary_entry" corresp="#SMITHDNB">&#x201C;Smith, George Murray</title> (<date notBefore="1824" notAfter="1901">1824&#x2013;1901</date>)&#x201D;</ref>; 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN"><persName corresp="#JFORD">Ford</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#FORDACKERMANN"><hi rend="italic">Ackermann</hi></title></ref>, 65).
                    </p>
                    <p>The success of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s venture appears to have hinged on a striking physical presentation of binding and printing and on the appeal of the illustrations.
                        The first issue of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> under the new proprietorship received a complementary notice in  
                        <title type="periodical" corresp="#MIRROROFLITERATURE" rend="italic">The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction</title>, 
                        the review focusing first on the &#x201C;exterior, which is somewhat novel in taste, . . . by substituting for the usual paper covering 
                        [i.e., like the printed paper boards covering the <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT" rend="italic">Forget Me Not</title>], an elegantly embossed leather binding. 
                        This is altogether an improvement on the original plan, since the slight coverings of silk or paper is scarcely safe out of the drawing&#x2010;room or boudoir, 
                        and some of the contributions to the &#x2018;annuals&#x2019; entitle them to a higher stand&#x201D;
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SPIRITOFTHEANNUALS">&#x201C;Spirit of &#x2018;The Annuals&#x2019; for 1828&#x201D;</ref>, 418). 
                        The binding of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> featured an arabesque design that was blind embossed into the full surface of the dark leather cover, 
                        with a lyre design blocked in gilt in the center of the front cover. As <persName corresp="#EJ">Eleanore Jamieson</persName> remarks in 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JAMIESONBINDINGSTYLES"><title corresp="#JAMIESONBINDINGSTYLES">&#x201C;The Binding Styles of the Gift Books and Annuals&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        the arabesque pattern was regarded as a revival style hearkening to the early book, 
                        and the style was associated with Continental models
                        (p. 11; and see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php"><title type="bibliography" corresp="#ANNUALSANDOTHER">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</title></ref>).
                    </p>
                    <p>The annuals dueled to be judged by their covers, the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT" rend="italic">Forget Me Not</title> having set an initial standard with its printed and glazed paper boards, 
                        cloth spine, and slipcase, later replaced by a silk cover 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN"><persName corresp="#JFORD">Ford</persName>, <title type="biography" corresp="#FORDACKERMAN"><hi rend="italic">Ackermann</hi></title></ref>, 65).  
                        Innovation and extravagance&#x2014;or at least the appearance of extravagance&#x2014;in bindings and engraved front matter became characteristic of annuals, 
                        which used this immediate source of appeal to compete in a crowded market 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FAXONLITERARYANNUALS">Faxon, <title type="bibliography" corresp="FAXONLITERARYANNUALS"><hi rend="italic">Literary Annuals</hi></title></ref>, xiv&#x2013;xvi). 
                        Perhaps the <title type="periodical" corresp="#MIRROROFLITERATURE" rend="italic">Mirror of Literature</title> was also commenting on the sturdier content, and not just the cover, 
                        of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>, in suggesting that embossed leather would hold up outside the boudoir.
                    </p>
                    <p>The other notable source of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s success, the quality of illustration, 
                        was the special care of one partner in the young firm, <persName corresp="#AE">Alexander Elder</persName> (<date notBefore="1790" notAfter="1876">1790&#x2013;1876</date>). 
                        According to <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER"><persName corresp="#LHUXLEY">Huxley</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER"><hi rend="italic">House of Smith Elder</hi></title></ref>, 
                        <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName> was interested in art, and aspired to produce elegantly illustrated publications (p. 10). 
                        Illustration was key to the popularity of the annuals, as <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName> would have realized from the precedent set by <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s success. 
                        The first issue of <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT" rend="italic">Forget Me Not</title> had featured a series of emblematic treatments of the twelve months, rendered in copper etching, 
                        along with verses by <persName corresp="#WC">William Combe</persName> (<date notBefore="1742" notAfter="1823">1742&#x2013;1823</date>). 
                        <persName corresp="#WC">Combe</persName> was well known as the author of 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#TOUROFDOCTORSYNTAX" rend="italic">The Tour of Doctor Syntax, in Search of the Picturesque</title> (<date when="1812">1812</date>, <date when="1820">1820</date>, <date when="1821">1821</date>), 
                        a spoof illustrated by <persName corresp="#TR">Thomas Rowlandson</persName> (<date notBefore="1757" notAfter="1827">1757&#x2013;1827</date>). 
                        This illustrated work ranked among the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> firm&#x02BC;s greatest best&#x2010;sellers 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN"><persName corresp="#JFORD">Ford</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#FORDACKERMANN"><hi rend="italic">Ackermann</hi></title></ref>, 52&#x2013;60); 
                        and by employing <persName corresp="#WC">Combe</persName> along with an illustrator on the new publication, <persName corresp="#RAP">Rudolph Ackermann</persName> 
                        was probably striving to maintain this popularity.
                    </p>
                    <p>In some respects, however, the illustrated emblems of the months in <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT" rend="italic">Forget Me Not</title> 
                        looked backward to an <date notBefore="1701" notAfter="1800">eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> tradition, rather than forward to new fashions. Copper engraving 
                        was soon to be displaced by more durable steel engraving, which would allow for much larger press runs; and the very inclusion of a monthly calendar hearkened 
                        to the gift annual&#x02BC;s beginnings in the eighteenth&#x2010;century &#x201C;pocket book&#x201D; 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php"> <title type="bibliography" corresp="#ANNUALSANDOTHER">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</title></ref>). 
                        The second volume of <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT" rend="italic">Forget Me Not</title>, featured much more varied pictorial scenes (albeit with mausoleums predominating), 
                        which were highlighted in the front matter by a list of plates 
                        that stood separately from the literary table of contents. The dual tables of contents&#x2014;emblematic of the growing importance of visual culture in the early Victorian period&#x2014;remained typical of annuals thereafter 
                        (see the facsimiles of <title type="archive" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> available in 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT"><persName corresp="#KDH">Harris</persName>, ed., <title type="archive" corresp="#HARRISFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Forget Me Not&#x201D; Archive</hi></title></ref>).

                        this plate would have among the early steel engravings produced by the <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="finden_brothers_note.php">Finden brothers</ref> 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED">Hunnisett, <title type="essay" corresp="#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED"><hi rend="italic">Steel&#x2010;Engraved Book Illustration in England</hi></title></ref>, 84&#x2013;85). 
                        <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s annual had now caught up with the technology of steel engraving for book illustration, 
                        which proved key to the success of the annuals. As compared with softer copper, which soon lost its edge in repeated impressions, 
                        steel engraving made possible the mass production of images, and helped to satisfy the craving for pervasive, but affordable visual culture by the early&#x2010;Victorian middle class. 
                        These developments coincided with <persName corresp="#AE">Alexander Elder</persName>&#x02BC;s ambitions for <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>.
                    </p>
                    <p><orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> benefited by these early, rapid developments in the annual as a commodity. 
                        Its binding was more sumptuous, and the engraving sharper and more consistent. At the same time, 
                        a comparison of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s product with the volumes published by the annual&#x02BC;s creator, <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>, 
                        suggests that the new firm attempted to keep the interior uniform with earlier volumes, at least initially. 
                        <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> did expand the title, however, from <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="anthology" corresp="RELFEFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering: A Literary Album</hi></title> to 
                        <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering: A Literary Album and Annual Remembrancer</hi>.  
                        In <date when="1833">1833</date>, the title changed again, the annual having absorbed another existing publication, <hi rend="italic">Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi>, 
                        which had been published in <placeName corresp="#LIVERPOOL">Liverpool</placeName> since <date when="1828">1828</date>. This merger resulted in the title, 
                        <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi> (so the title appears on the typeset title page; 
                        for a time, the engraved frontispiece with the earlier title remained in production). 
                        This latest title was in use when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first appeared in the annual, in the issue, 
                        <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath: A Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present for <hi rend="smallcaps">MDCCCXXXV</hi></hi></title>.

                        would have been important to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, who was of course a Scot himself,

                        Among <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s early successes were ambitious illustrated works on <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>, such as a series of engraved views of the principal towns. 
                        <persName corresp="#GH">Gillian Hughes</persName> suggests that <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName> in particular was a central figure for the expatriate group of literary Scotsmen in London during the

                        Gathered around <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName> were a number of Scottish literary men 
                        who were proving their way in the burgeoning <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> publishing market&#x2014;men such as <persName corresp="#LR">Leitch Ritchie</persName> (<date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1865">1800&#x2013;1865</date>) and

                        It would have mattered to the Ruskins that <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s editorship of <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi> 
                        had been appreciately noticed in the &#x201C;<title type="series" corresp="#NOCTESAMBROSIANAE">Noctes Ambrosianae</title>&#x201D; of <title type="periodical" corresp="#BLACKWOODSMAGAZINE"><hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x02BC;s Edinburgh Magazine</hi></title>

                    <p>Starting his editorship in <date when="1828">1828</date>, <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s first volume of <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi> was

                        as editor until his death in <date when="1834-12">December 1834</date>, having prepared the volume for <date when="1835">1835</date> (i.e., for the holiday season of <date notBefore="1834-11" notAfter="1835-01">1834&#x2013;35</date>). 
                        This last volume, which featured the young <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, was substantially completed during the <date notBefore="1834-06-21" notAfter="1834-09-22">summer of 1834</date> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#VIGNEPRINGLE">Vigne, <hi rend="italic">Thomas Pringle</hi></ref>, 244). In this volume, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> made his first

                        <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s relationship with the Ruskin family was struck considerably earlier than his editing of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> for the <date notBefore="1834-11" notAfter="1835-01">1834&#x2013;35</date> volume,

                        Certainly, <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> was on a familiar footing 
                        with the family by <date when="1832-01">January 1832</date>, when he introduced the Ruskins to the writer, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="hogg_james_note.php">James Hogg (<date notBefore="1770" notAfter="1835">ca. 1770&#x2013;1835</date>)</ref>.

                    <p>It is interesting that an eighteen&#x2010;year&#x2010;old youth, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cousin, <persName corresp="#CTR">Charles</persName>, deemed it appropriate to present a younger boy, aged ten, with <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi> as a gift. 
                        It is even more surprising that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s aunt made him a gift of <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT" rend="italic">Forget Me Not</title> when he was only eight. Annuals were usually characterized as an appropriate gift for women, 
                        whereas the so&#x2010;called &#x201C;juvenile&#x201D; annuals formed a distinct commodity for children. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s mother, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>, 
                        reacted to <persName corresp="#CTR">Charles</persName>&#x02BC;s gift with disapproval of the publication&#x02BC;s poor educational influences: &#x201C;The plates are well done but they are not interesting[;] 
                        the tales are horrible enough[;] the poetry very so so I think[;]<!-- stet repeated "so" -->
                        upon the whole it does not improve&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 208). 
                        In <title type="autobiography" corresp="#PRAETERITA" rend="italic">Praeterita</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> read the gift as prompted by <persName corresp="#CTR">Charles</persName>&#x02BC;s pride 
                        in the material sumptuousness that his employers had bestowed on their newly acquired title: <persName corresp="#CTR">Charles</persName> 
                        &#x201C;took personal pride in everything produced by the firm,&#x201D; as Ruskin believed &#x201C;all right&#x2010;minded apprentices and good shopmen do&#x201D;; 
                        and it was in keeping with the reputation of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> 
                        for producing fine illustrated books that <persName corresp="#CTR">Charles</persName> &#x201C;on Sundays always brought a volume or two in his pocket 
                        to show us the character of . . . [the firm&#x02BC;s] most ambitious publications; especially choosing, on my behalf, any which chanced to contain good engravings&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 35:91). It was the up&#x2010;to&#x2010;date materiality of <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi> 
                        that could make this adult annual appealing to young people; and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would demonstrate his engagement with modern technology of reproducible imagery in his

                    <p>As later in the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own handmade version of an illustrated book, <persName corresp="#CTR">Charles</persName>&#x02BC;s gift 
                        may also have testified to his young <persName corresp="#JR">cousin</persName>&#x02BC;s precocity, for there appears to be no evidence that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                        condescended to be a consumer of the &#x201C;juvenile&#x201D; annuals, which were designed for his age group, 
                        and which began appearing between <date when="1828">1828</date> and <date when="1830">1830</date>&#x2014;precisely when he was presented with the more adult <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi>

                        We can only guess at gift&#x2010;givers&#x02BC; motives, however. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <persName corresp="#BR">aunt</persName>&#x02BC;s present,
