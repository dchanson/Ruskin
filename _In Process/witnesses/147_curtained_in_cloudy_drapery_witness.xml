                <p>147. &#x201C;Curtained in cloudy drapery,&#x201D; (&#x201C;Moonlight on the Mountains&#x201D;), November 30, MSS V, 
                    VIII. MS V version printed in PJR, 1:100; Works, 2:330. MS VIII version previously unpublished.</p>
                
                <p>Dated by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in MS V. Titled by <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> (see no. 124); 
                    untitled by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>. MS VIII contains three stanzas beyond the two copied into MS V. The three 
                    extra stanzas in MS VIII are numbered 3&#x2013;5 by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, 
                    unlike the first two, which are unnumbered, and the three stanzas appear to be composed with 
                    a different pen than what was used for the first two&#x2014;all of which suggests the possibility 
                    that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> fair-copied the first two stanzas 
                    in MS V and then extended the poem in MS VIII as an afterthought. The end of the poem in MS VIII 
                    is strongly marked by an ornamental horizontal line and stars.</p> 
                
                <p>The tone of the extra MS VIII stanzas&#x2014;radically differing from that of the MS V 
                    stanzas, which were chosen for publication and given a sentimental title by the editor&#x2014;presents 
                    a good example of the selective editing in PJR. In this case, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood's</persName> 
                    preference for the sentimental is supported by self-censorship in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin's</persName> fair copy.</p>
                
                <p>The following reprints the complete MS VIII version. The MS V version (i.e., first 
                    two stanzas of MS VIII version) is entirely unpunctuated, as compared with the Works 
                    version; first letters of lines are capitalized; and only the second stanza is 
                    numbered.</p>
