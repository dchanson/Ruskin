                <head>John Howard Whitehouse (1873&#x2013;?<!-- Entry needed here -->)</head>
                <p>The most important private Ruskin collector in England. The history of his
                    collecting is extensively detailed in Dearden, <hi rend="italic">Ruskin,
                        Bembridge and Brantwood</hi>.</p>
                <p>Owing to his career in boys&#x02BC; education, which emerged as early as 1906 and led to
                    his founding of Bembridge School in 1919, Whitehouse might be expected to have
                    taken a special interest in the work of Ruskin&#x02BC;s boyhood. Certainly, he combined
                    vocation with collecting at the school by using the Ruskin Galleries, which
                    housed his personal collection, to expose all the boys to art as &#x201C;an influence
                    in [their] spiritual and intellectual life&#x201D; and to enlist especially keen
                    students as &#x201C;boy curator[s]&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Ruskin the Painter</hi>, 41,
                    139; and see Dearden, <hi rend="italic">Ruskin, Bembridge and Brantwood</hi>,
                    46&#x2013;47).</p>
                <p>In strict terms of acquisition, however, Whitehouse&#x02BC;s interest in the early
                    Ruskin appears to have been confined to the drawings and the diaries. One reason
                    for narrowing his focus is suggested by Whitehouse&#x02BC;s 1938 book, <hi
                        rend="italic">Ruskin the Painter</hi>, which begins by &#x201C;recapitulat[ing]
                    certain main features of [Ruskin&#x02BC;s] life as a boy and youth&#x201D; from <hi
                        rend="italic">Praeterita</hi> (p. 13), as if the autobiography inspired a
                    somewhat deadening reverence, its account of the early years beyond question. By
                    contrast, Whitehouse&#x02BC;s writing comes alive when appreciating the drawing, an
                    area in which he believed he could make a contribution: &#x201C;Ruskin&#x02BC;s eminence as a
                    writer and social reformer has perhaps obscured the extraordinary service he
                    rendered by his incomparable range of drawings&#x201D; (ibid.). </p>
                <p>The early drawing captivated Whitehouse &#x201C;not only for the skill shown by so young
                    a boy, but because [the drawings] show certain great qualities which came to
                    perfection in his later work,&#x201D; and the early diaries evidently interested him
                    for the same reasons (<hi rend="italic">Ruskin the Painter</hi>, p. 15).
                    Doubtless because Whitehouse was as &#x201C;an intense believer in the right of the
                    individual to shape his own life&#x201D; (Dearden, <hi rend="italic">Ruskin, Bembridge
                        and Brantwood</hi>, 11), he treated Ruskin&#x02BC;s drawing as self&#x2010;taught:
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s first &#x201C;real tutor,&#x201D; Whitehouse insisted, &#x201C;was himself&#x201D; (ibid., 17).
                    Later, Whitehouse along with Joan Evans would make a similar point about the
                    diaries, declaring at the outset of the preface to their edition of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Diaries</hi>, &#x201C;it is the solitary man who keeps a diary; and
                    Ruskin, though he never lived and rarely travelled alone, was a man doomed to
                    intellectual and spiritual solitude&#x201D; (1:v). Appropriately, therefore, soon after
                    founding Bembridge School to instruct these ideals of self&#x2010;reliance and
                    independence of thought, Whitehouse acquired Ruskin&#x02BC;s &#x201C;first sketch&#x2010;book&#x201D; (see
                    MS <!--Entry needed here-->?; see Dearden, <hi rend="italic">Ruskin, Bembridge and Brantwood</hi>, 38;
                    see <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> ...). </p>
                <p>Other purchases relatively early in Whitehouse&#x02BC;s Ruskin collecting, when he
                    frequently dealt directly with Arthur Severn, included, in 1927, an 1828 map of
                    Scotland<note n="1" type="biblio" place="botwin" resp="#DCH">Whitehouse, <hi
                            rend="italic">Ruskin the Painter</hi>, no. 120 (p. 84).</note> and <!-- Entry needed here-->??
                    drawings (Dearden, <hi rend="italic">Ruskin, Bembridge and Brantwood</hi>, 41);
                    and, by 1929 (from an unknown source), two 1835 drawings of Bienne and of Munich
                    (ibid., 45).<note n="2" type="biblio" place="botwin" resp="#DCH"><hi
                            rend="italic">Ruskin the Painter</hi>, nos. 45 (p. 63) and 204 (p. 104.
                        Whitehouse included these two drawings in <hi rend="italic">Solitary
                            Warrior</hi> without any obvious relation to the surrounding letters
                        (which primarily deal with the economic and social work of later years) or
                        the other drawings included in that edition. Of the drawings&#x02BC; inclusion, he
                        says only that &#x201C;they serve to remind us that at every stage in his life
                        Ruskin used his brush and pencil to illustrate his teaching and to record
                        things of beauty seen&#x201D; (p. 24).</note>
