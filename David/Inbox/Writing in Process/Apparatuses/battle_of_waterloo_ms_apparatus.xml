                        <p>W. G. Collingwood evidently had not seen 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="battle_of_waterloo_ms_apparatus"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#BATTLEOFWATERLOOMS">"Battle of Waterloo, A Play, in Two Acts, with Other Small Poems, Dedicated to His Father"</title></ref>, 
                            by 1891, when he edited the Poems, 
                            since he takes his copytext for <ref type="apparatus" target="on_skiddaw_and_derwent_water_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D;</title></ref> 
                            from the "childish and almost illegible scribble" of the poem's draft in <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title></ref>, 
                            instead of from the much clearer fair-copy text in the booklet 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>, 1:269; 
                            <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS8D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [8<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>, 1:270). 
                            Collingwood did see the booklet in time for his 1893 biography of Ruskin, in which he describes it as "a book more elaborate than any" Ruskin had so far made, 
                            "something better than the 'show'" (i.e., The Puppet Show), and 
                            consisting of "sixteen pages in a red cover, with a title-page quite like print." 
                            The production and its contents seemed to Collingwood to mark 1829 for Ruskin's "advance in poetical composition" 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="#WGCLIFEOFJR1893"><hi rend="italic">Life and Work of John Ruskin</hi></ref>, 1:37).</p>
                        <p>The manuscript is first mentioned in the Library Edition's expansion of Collingwood's "Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems" as 
                            "a thin paper book," its "leaves" having "now" been "inserted" in <ref type="apparatus" target="msv_apparatus"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title></ref> 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 2:531). The description suggests that the booklet 
                            was tipped into <ref type="apparatus" target="msv_apparatus"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title></ref> in the course of collecting and binding 
                            manuscripts in preparation for editing the Library Edition; however, an odd comment by Collingwood may suggest that it was he who associated the booklet with the bound notebook 
                            that Ruskin entitled "Miscellaneous Poetry." With the "Waterloo" booklet containing other pieces "appended" to the play, Collingwood says, these pieces thus became 
                            "printed in [Ruskin's] collected Poems from a previous copy" 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="#WGCLIFEOFJR1893"><hi rend="italic">Life and Work of John Ruskin</hi></ref>, 1:37-38). 
                            By Ruskin's "print[ing] in . . . collected Poems," Collingwood may refer to the boy's conceptual ambition rather than specifically to 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msv_apparatus"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title></ref> as the embodiment of that ambition. 
                            Either way, Collingwood appears to have marked 1829 for its "advance in poetical conception" in terms not only of the sophistication of the verse, 
                            but also of Ruskin's self-conscious authorship as a poet who "collected" his verse.</p>
