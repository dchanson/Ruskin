                <l>Oh, we are on the mountain&#x2010;top! </l>
                <l>The clouds float by in fleecy flock, </l>
                <l>Heavy, and dank. Around, below,</l> 
                <l>A wilderness of turf and snow,&#x2014;</l>
                <l>Scanty rock turf, or marble bare, </l>
                <l>Without a living thing; for there </l>
                <l>Not a bird clove the thin, cold air </l>
                <l>With labouring wing: the very goat </l>
                <l>To such a height ascendeth not; </l>
                <l>And if the cloud&#x02BC;s thick drapery </l>
                <l>Clove for a moment, you would see </l>
                <l>The long, white snow fields on each side </l>
                <l>Clasping the mountain&#x2010;breast, or heaped </l>
                <l>In high, wreathed hills, whence torrents leaped,</l>
                <l>And gathering force, as down they well </l>
                <l>To aid the swift <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine&#x02BC;s</geogName> headlong swell. </l>
                <l>And here and there a mould&#x02BC;ring cross </l>
                <l>Of dark pine, matted o&#x02BC;er with moss. </l>
                <l>Hung o&#x02BC;er<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> the precipice, to tell </l>
                <l>Where some benighted traveller fell; </l>
                <l>Or where the avalanche&#x02BC;s leap </l>
                <l>Hurled down, with its wild thunder sweep,</l>
                <l>Him unexpecting; and to pray </l>
                <l>The passing traveller to stay, </l>
                <l>And, looking from the precipice </l>
                <l>Dizzily down to the abyss, </l>
                <l>To wing to heaven one short prayer, </l>
                <l>One, for the soul that parted there.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> </l><pb/>
                <l>I thought, as by the cross I past, </l>
                <l>Of far <geogName corresp="#HELVELLYN">Helvellyn&#x02BC;s</geogName> dreary waste, </l>
                <l>&#x02BC;Mid my own hills, and legend strange; </l>
                <l>How from dark <geogName corresp="#STRIDINGEDGE">Striden&#x02BC;s</geogName><hi rend="superscript">1</hi> ridgy range </l>
                <l>One fell, upon a wintry day, </l>
                <l>When snow wreaths white concealed his way, </l>
                <l>And died, beside a small dark tarn, </l>
                <l>Overlooked by crags, whose foreheads stern </l>
                <l>Shut in a little vale; a spot </l>
                <l>By men unknown and trodden not, </l>
                <l>Green, and most beautiful, and lay </l>
                <l>His bones there whitening, many a day, </l>
                <l>Though sun and rain might work their will, </l>
                <l>From bird and wolf protected still; </l>
                <l>For he had one companion, one, </l>
                <l>Watched o&#x02BC;er him in the desert lone; </l>
                <l>That faithful dog beside sat aye </l>
                <l>Baying the vulture from his prey, </l>
                <l>Else moved not, slept not, stirred not, still </l>
                <l>O&#x02BC;er lake and mountain, rock and rill, </l>
                <l>Rung his short, plaintive, timid cry, </l>
                <l>Most melancholy. None passed by, </l>
                <l>None heard his sorrowing call for aid, </l>
                <l>Yet still beside the corse he staid, </l>
                <l>And watched it moulder, and the clay, </l>
                <l>When three long months had past away, </l>
                <l>It was discovered where it lay, </l>
                <l>And he beside it. Would that we could love </l>
                <l>As he did.</l>
