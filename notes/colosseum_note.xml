                <p>The <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> was a vast structure built 
                    <date notBefore="1824" notAfter="1826">1824&#x2013;26</date> to house an ambitious circular, painted panorama of <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, 
                    along with other entertainments. The panorama was based on drawings by <persName corresp="#THP">Thomas Hornor</persName> (<date notBefore="1785" notAfter="1844">1785&#x2013;1844</date>), 
                    a multi&#x2010;talented surveyor, cartographer, and landscape designer. <persName corresp="#THP">Hornor</persName> made his drawings circa <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1823">1820&#x2013;23</date>, 
                    while daringly housed atop scaffolding erected at the summit of <placeName type="building" corresp="#STPAULCATHEDRAL">St. Paul&#x02BC;s Cathedral</placeName>.
                    The drawings were transferred to canvas by the painter, <persName corresp="#ETP">E. T. Parris</persName>, who worked section by section on an enormous canvas stretched 
                    inside the <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName> dome. The sections were then painted by <persName corresp="#ETP">Parris</persName> 
                    along with other artists between <date notBefore="1825" notAfter="1829">1825 and 1829</date>. The completed work was believed to be &#x201C;in effect the largest 
                    oil painting the world had ever seen&#x201D;, exhibited inside &#x201C;the largest [dome] in the land&#x201D;, which was &#x201C;even larger than that on 
                    <placeName type="building" corresp="#STPAULCATHEDRAL">St. Paul&#x02BC;s</placeName>, as . . . proprietors never tired of telling their public&#x201D;. 
                    Inside the dome, visitors were able to view the panorama by ascending to a lower sight level and to an upper sight level, reached either by stairs or by an &#x201C;ascending room&#x201D;&#x2014;the city&#x02BC;s 
                    first passenger elevator. In order to raise funds, the panorama exhibition opened prematurely in <date when="1829">1829</date>, before the painting and other exhibits 
                    were quite finished, and the project would not be fully realized in its first instantiation until <date when="1832">1832</date>. Soon after the opening 
                    in <date when="1829">1829</date>, <persName corresp="#THP">Hornor</persName> went bankrupt and fled to <placeName corresp="#USA">America</placeName>, 
                    where his financial backer, a prominent banker, had already absconded, leaving behind huge debts

                <p>A related amusement, which opened in <date when="1823">1823</date>, six years prior to the <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName> and near its site 
                    in <placeName corresp="#REGENTSPARK">Regent&#x02BC;s Park</placeName>, was the <placeName type="building" corresp="#LONDONDIORAMA">London Diorama</placeName>. 
                    Based on the diorama in <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName> invented by <persName corresp="#LJMD">Louis&#x2010;Jacques&#x2010;Mand&#x00E9; Daguerre</persName> (<date notBefore="1787" notAfter="1851">1787&#x2013;1851</date>) 
                    and an architectural painter, <persName corresp="#CMB">Charles Bouton</persName>, the <placeName type="building" corresp="#LONDONDIORAMA">London Diorama</placeName> theater 
                    was designed by the artist and architectural illustrator, <persName corresp="#ACP">Auguste Charles Pugin</persName> (<date notBefore="1768" notAfter="1832">1768/9&#x2013;1832</date>,

                    Its effects were achieved by manipulating light reflected off an opaque painting and refracted through a transparency. The auditorium, in which observers were seated, 
                    was rotated from one diorama scene to the next (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SAUNDERSREGENTSPARK"><persName corresp="#ASAUNDERS">Saunders</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#SAUNDERSREGENTSPARK"><hi rend="italic">Regent&#x02BC;s Park</hi></title></ref>, 130).</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> mentions the <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName> in connection with one of its side exhibits, 
                    the <placeName type="building" corresp="#SWISSCOTTAGECOLOSSEUM">&#x201C;Swiss Cottage&#x201D;</placeName>, in the course of writing about

                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> thus touches tangentially on one of the great metropolitan building projects of his parents&#x02BC; generation, 
                    <persName corresp="#JN">John Nash</persName>&#x02BC;s (<date notBefore="1752" notAfter="1835">1752&#x2013;1835</date>) <placeName corresp="#REGENTSPARK">Regent&#x02BC;s Park</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#REGENTSTREET">Regent Street</placeName>, 
                    and their associated buildings. The <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName> was built in the southwest corner of 
                    <placeName corresp="#REGENTSPARK">Regent&#x02BC;s Park</placeName>, between two of <persName corresp="#JN">Nash</persName>&#x02BC;s terraces lining the outer drive of the park. 
                    In keeping with the neoclassical terraces, the <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName> was designed by <persName corresp="#DB">Decimus Burton</persName> 
                    (<date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1881">1800&#x2013;1881</date>) in Greek Revival style&#x2014;specifically, modeled on the <name type="building" corresp="#PANTHEON">Pantheon</name> in <placeName corresp="#ROME">Rome</placeName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BURTONDNB"><persName corresp="#DA">Arnold</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#BURTONDNB">&#x201C;Burton, Decimus [<date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1881">1800&#x2013;1881</date>]&#x201D;</title></ref>).</p>
                <p>As architect to the <persName corresp="#KG4">Prince Regent</persName>, <persName corresp="#JN">Nash</persName> conceived a vision for transforming <placeName corresp="#MARYLEBONE">Marylebone</placeName>, 
                    a country park on the northern edge of <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, into a new urban residential park for the city. <persName corresp="#JN">Nash</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    plans were informed by the taste for the picturesque, which his former partner, the landscape designer <persName corresp="#HR">Humphry Repton</persName> (<date notBefore="1752" notAfter="1818">1752&#x2013;1818</date>), 
                    had promoted in giving shape to numerous estates (albeit while embroiled in controversy with theorists of the picturesque, <persName corresp="#UP">Uvedale Price</persName> [<date notBefore="1747" notAfter="1829">1747&#x2013;1829</date>] 
                    and <persName corresp="#RPK">Richard Payne Knight</persName> [<date notBefore="1751" notAfter="1824">1751&#x2013;1824</date>]). <persName corresp="#JN">Nash</persName> 
                    complemented these park settings with picturesque cottages and villas in a wide range of styles, from structures that he modeled on a &#x201C;picture&#x201D; in the strict sense 
                    of drawing inspiration from structures depicted in the Italian campagna scenes by <persName corresp="#CLAUDE">Claude Lorrain</persName>; to irregular, castellated dwellings; 
                    to thatch cottages; and most exotically, to the &#x201C;Indian&#x201D; forms of <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRIGHTONPAVILION">Brighton Pavilion</placeName>, 
                    which he conceived for the <persName corresp="#KG4">Prince Regent</persName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SUMMERSONARCHITECTUREINBRITAIN"><persName corresp="#JSUMMERSON">Summerson</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Architecture of Britain</hi></ref>, 288&#x2013;94).</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#JN">Nash</persName> brought the picturesque to bear on city planning with the <placeName corresp="#REGENTSPARK">Regent&#x02BC;s Park</placeName> project, 
                    begun in wartime, in <date notBefore="1811" notAfter="1812">1811&#x2013;12</date>, prior to <date when="1815-06-18">Waterloo</date> and the end of the 
                    <date notBefore="1799-11-09" notAfter="1815-06-18">Napoleonic Wars</date>. Rather than simply extending the city to cover the space formerly belonging to <placeName corresp="#MARYLEBONE">Marylebone</placeName>, 
                    <persName corresp="#JN">Nash</persName> landscaped the park as a picturesque setting to showcase (yet another) palace for the <persName corresp="#KG4">Prince Regent</persName>, 
                    as well as a grand church to serve as a &#x201C;Valhalla&#x201D; for the nation&#x02BC;s heroes. These structures were never realized, but more significantly the plan 
                    sponsored the design and construction of numerous urban villas&#x2014;a new kind of urban residence set in Reptonian picturesque landscaping, 
                    each villa invisible to its neighbor. Some of the first of these villas were designed by <persName corresp="#DB">Decimus Burton</persName>, the architect of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName>, 
                    whose work spanned a wide range of what could be considered a villa&#x2014;so wide that <persName corresp="#DA">Dana Arnold</persName> characterizes <persName corresp="#DB">Burton</persName>&#x02BC;s ideas as 
                    &#x201C;a state of mind as . . . [the houses] offered their occupants a retreat from the rigours of life in the metropolis&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ARNOLDFAMILYAFFAIR"><persName corresp="#DA">Arnold</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#ARNOLDFAMILYAFFAIR">&#x201C;A Family Affair&#x201D;</title></ref>, 117).</p>
                <p>To connect these residences with <placeName corresp="#WESTMINSTER">Westminster</placeName> and the more established haunts of the ruling class&#x2014;<placeName corresp="#PALLMALLLONDON">Pall Mall</placeName>, 
                    <placeName corresp="#STJAMESPARK">St. James&#x02BC;s Park</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#GREENPARK">Green Park</placeName> 
                    (where <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was introduced to <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="rogers_samuel_note.php">Samuel Rogers</ref>, avatar of taste,

                    The collonaded avenue stretched north from <placeName type="building" corresp="#CARLTONHOUSE">Carlton House</placeName>, the <persName corresp="#KG4">Prince Regent</persName>&#x02BC;s residence 
                    remodeled by <persName corresp="#JN">Nash</persName>, through <placeName corresp="#PORTLANDPLACE">Portland Place</placeName>, lined with buildings designed by the fashionable 
                    architects of the preceding generation, the Scotsmen <persName corresp="#RADAM">Robert</persName> (<date notBefore="1728" notAfter="1792">1728&#x2013;92</date>) and 
                    <persName corresp="#JADAM">James Adam</persName> (<date notBefore="1732" notAfter="1794">1732&#x2013;94</date>), to the outsize neoclassicism of <persName corresp="#JN">Nash</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    terraces and <persName corresp="#DB">Burton</persName>&#x02BC;s <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MARGETSONREGENCY"><persName corresp="#SMARGETSON">Margetson</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#MARGETSONREGENCY"><hi rend="italic">Regency London</hi></title></ref>, 45&#x2013;55). 
                    <persName corresp="RDA">Richard Altick</persName> speculates that the <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName>, erected in the southwest 
                    corner of <placeName corresp="#REGENTSPARK">Regent&#x02BC;s Park</placeName> and connected to <placeName corresp="#PALLMALLLONDON">Pall Mall</placeName> by <placeName corresp="#REGENTSTREET">Regent Street</placeName>, 
                    was conceived by its backers as &#x201C;a kind of public counterpart of <placeName type="building" corresp="#CARLTONHOUSE">Carlton House</placeName>, the sumptuous mansion . . . 
                    on which the <persName corresp="#KG4">Prince Regent</persName>, now <persName corresp="#KG4">George IV</persName>, had squandered a fortune&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ALTICKSHOWSOFLONDON"><persName corresp="#RDA">Altick</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#ALTICKSHOWSOFLONDON"><hi rend="italic">The Shows of London</hi></title></ref>, 142).</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#THP">Hornor</persName>&#x02BC;s panorama and <persName corresp="#ACP">Pugin</persName>&#x02BC;s  diorama were located in <placeName corresp="#REGENTSPARK">Regent&#x02BC;s Park</placeName> 
                    because their creators and backers believed that their spectacles would command a sophisticated audience. Among their predecessors, <persName corresp="#PJdeL">Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg</persName> exhibited 
                    his ediophusikon exclusively to a genteel public, and <persName corresp="#RBARKER">Robert Barker</persName> and his son and associates maintained the 
                    <placeName type="building" corresp="#LEICESTERSQPANORAMA">Leicester Square Panorama</placeName> as a respectable entertainment from <date notBefore="1793" notAfter="1863">1793 to 1863</date>. 
                    Although <persName corresp="#RDA">Altick</persName> traces a decline in the kind and quality of entertainment that successive proprietors of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName> 
                    offered over the years, these institutions were founded with pretensions of advancing their respective arts of scenic representation, and they claimed a place in the heritage 
                    of the fine arts in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>. However <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have responded to such claims, his youthful encounters 
                    with the Old Masters&#x2014;if only with their names and copies of their works&#x2014;occurred at these exhibitions as well as in art galleries at home and abroad. 
                    Like other visitors to the <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName>, he entered its imposing Doric portico and passed through 
                    &#x201C;a spacious rotunda called &#x2018;the Saloon of the Arts&#x2019; or &#x2018;the Hall of Sculpture&#x2019;. Here, by invitation of the 
                    &#x2018;committee of management&#x2019; (Hornor&#x02BC;s creditors), &#x2018;professors of the ingenious and fine arts&#x2019; exhibited their works. 
                    Alongside recent productions there stood casts of <persName corresp="#PHIDIAS">Phidias</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="artwork" corresp="#PHIDIASDIANA"><hi rend="italic">Diana</hi></title>,
