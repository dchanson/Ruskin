                    <p>In March 1847, when John James Ruskin wrote to his friend, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="harrison_w_h_note.php"><persName corresp="#WHH">W. H. Harrison</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1792" notAfter="1878">1792&#x2013;1878</date>)</ref>, 
                        to affirm his intention to have a collection of his son's poems printed, he referred to having "had for a very long time a Volume of yours containing some light pieces of my son". 
                        In other words, before the <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1850"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1850)</title> was realized, the family and friends 
                        produced and made use of compilations of Ruskin's poems (<title type="letter" corresp="#jjr_to_whh_1847-03-08"><placeName corresp="#LEEDS">Leeds</placeName>, <date when="1847-03-08">8 March 1847</date></title>, in 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMSL5">Letters from <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> to <persName corresp="#WHH">W. H. Harrison</persName>, 1838&#x2013;1853</ref>). 
                        The "volume" mentioned in this letter probably refers to a present from Harrison to John James for the holiday season of <date when="1844-12-25">Christmas 1844</date> and <date when="1845-01-01">New Year&#x02BC;s 1845</date>.</p>
                    
                    <p>On <date when="1845-01-04">4 January 1845</date>, while spending a disagreeably unseasonal holiday at the seaside with his family in <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> thanked <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> for the &#x201C;trouble you have taken to get me a Set of

                        referring to John by the pen name he used for most of his contributions to annuals 
                        (<title type="letter" corresp="#jjr_to_whh_1845-01-04">letter</title>, in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMSL5"><persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> to <persName corresp="#WHH">W. H. Harrison</persName>, 1838&#x2013;1853</ref>). 
                        The current location of this volume, if extant, is unknown, so its contents cannot now be determined. If limited, as John James indicates, to contributions to 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php"><title ref="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title></ref>, 
                        the choice was logical as a gift from the former editor (<date notBefore="1836" notAfter="1841">1836&#x2013;41</date>) of that annual--and an editor 
                        who had grown particularly close to the Ruskin family during that tenure. Given the history of his relationship with the Ruskins, it seems no coincidence that the holiday season 
                        of Harrison's gift also marked the end of Ruskin's regular appearances in the holiday gift annual that had brought them together, 
                        <title ref="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>. After having contributed annually to the volumes for 1835 through 1844, 
                        in New Year's 1845 J.R. apppeared instead in two annuals edited by Lady Blessington for Longmans 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#JJR1845REACTION"><persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s Reaction to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s Abandonment of a Poet&#x02BC;s Vocation</ref>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Possibly the &#x201C;set&#x201D; of poems described by John James in this letter was the same item as the collection of &#x02BC;proofs of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s contributions 
                        to <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi>&#x02BD; that, according to the editors of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>, 
                        <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> &#x02BC;bound up&#x02BD; for <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> to carry &#x02BC;on his tours&#x02BD; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 2:xxxiv). So far, no provenance, description, or extant object can be connected 
                        with this statement, any more than with the "volume" in John James's letter. If the same object, one can speculate that the volume would have been bound in a size convenient for transport, 
                        and it was also intended for ease of reference. As John James commented later in the year to <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>, 
                        he was often frustrated by &#x201C;the Scatterment&#x201D; of his son&#x02BC;s poems published in annuals over several years; it was &#x201C;the Looking for the needle in the Bundle of Hay 
                        I dislike&#x2014;I know not how to have him or where to find him&#x201D;

                    <p>Another compilation that may have anticipated John James's project of printing <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poems for private circulation in <date when="1850">1850</date> 
                        was the bound holograph manuscript, <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="edmond_ms_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#EDMONDMS">&#x201C;J. Ruskin &#x007C; Poems&#x201D; (n.d.), or &#x201C;Edmond manuscript&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                        This consists of transcriptions, in an unidentified hand, of poems by J.R. published in <title ref="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>. 
                        As a holograph manuscript, it does not answer to the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>&#x02BC;s description of <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        bound proofs. Another possible indication of a provenance disconnected from Harrison is the omission of certain transcriptions--for example, the poem 
                        <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="remembrance_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRREMEMBRANCE">"Remembrance</title></ref><!--add title to crib-->, 
                        which is not signed "J.R." in Friendship's Offering, but which Harrison would have known to be Ruskin's; and of poems that were published in another publication edited by Harrison 
                        in <date when="1839">1839</date>, the <title type="periodical" corresp="#LONDONMONTHLYMISC"><hi rend="italic">London Monthly Miscellany</hi></title> 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 38:5).</p>
                    
                    <p>While the hand responsible for the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#EDMONDMS">&#x201C;Edmond manuscript&#x201D;</title> has not been identified, the physical item does make a good fit 
                        with circumstances mentioned by John James in his <title type="letter" corresp="#jjr_to_whh_1847-03-08"><date when="1847-03-08">8 March 1847</date> letter</title> quoted above, in which 
                        John James declares his intention to have Ruskin's poems printed. After thanking Harrison for his "volume", John James goes on: "I have delayed having them [John's "verses"] penned because I want to get the best 
                        of all he has ever penned selected &#x0026; printed in good Type". The <hi rend="italic">penning</hi> clearly refers to a copyist's work at the behest of John James, preliminary to publication. 
                        In 1845, John James followed a similar procedure in having John's letters from Italy copied, preparatory to publishing them as an epistolary travel narrative. As Harold Shapiro 
                        explains in his edition of the letters, John James "carefully preserved them, of course, and put them in order. More than that, the originals are full of his markings. He numbered them, 
                        supplied missing dates and places in the headings, made notations on them for a copyist, underlined the passages to be copied, cancelled details to be omitted, and even inserted a word 
                        here and there" (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RUSKININITALY"><persName corresp="#HIS">Shapiro</persName>, introduction to <title type="book" corresp="RUSKININITALY"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin in Italy</hi></title></ref>, xx). 
                        While no such editorial markings by John James are evident in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#EDMONDMS">&#x201C;Edmond manuscript&#x201D;</title>, its very exacting transcriptions 
                        might represent a stage in the evolving plans toward a printed volume; and while the existence of this manuscript seems to conflict with John James's statement that he had "delayed" 
                        transcription of John's poems, the manuscript may have been rejected as a false start, given John James's requirements in 1847. As explained in the 
                        <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="edmond_ms_apparatus.php#DESCRIPTION">description</ref> of the manuscript, the transcriptions are not "selected", 
                        as John James now wanted--starting, as they do, with <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="#JRSALTZBURG">"Saltzburg"</ref>, Ruskin's first poem published in 
                        <title ref="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>, 
                        which was not ultimately chosen for inclusion in the Poems (1850)--and the sequence of transcriptions is faulty, foundering on a mistake in transcription of the poems for 
                        <date when="1842">1842</date>. Nonetheless, regardless of whether this manuscript is related directly to John James's project of printing the Poems in 1850, 
                        the manuscript attests at the very least to the interest before 1850 in collecting <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poems scattered throughout published annuals.</p>

                <p>In <date when="1845">1845</date>, John James's need &#x201C;to have these trifles [of poems] more comeatable&#x2014;less scattered&#x201D; came to seem more pressing

                    who divided them between two annuals under her editorship, <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#KEEPSAKE1846"><title type="annual" corresp="KEEPSAKE1846"><hi rend="italic">The Keepsake, 1846</hi></title></ref> and

                    she had done with three poems by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in the previous year. &#x201C;You know we centred all in <title ref="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING">F. O.</title>&#x201D;,

                    published in the <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> annual. <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> pointed out that it would be &#x201C;no joke&#x201D; 
                    having now to present two annuals as holiday remembrances to people connected with the family&#x2014;and those two publications no less than the grand and expensive annuals superintended for

                    as compared with the familiar and less imposing annual produced by the Ruskins&#x02BC; friends at <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> 
                    (<title type="letter" corresp="#jjr_to_whh_1845-06-29"><placeName corresp="#LIVERPOOL">Liverpool</placeName>, <date when="1845-06-29">29 June 1845</date></title>, in

                    <p>A more worrying prospect to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> than the expense of holiday gifts, however, and a more emotional cause for collecting the poems for publication 
                        in <date when="1850">1850</date>, was the wrenching fact that the poems were becoming less important to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself. Already, <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        gift of the <date when="1845">1845</date> collection had apparently prompted some affectation of indifference by John, his father reporting that &#x201C;some in this House had no recollection 
                        of having before seen&#x201D; certain poems, although considerably connected with the Author&#x201D;
                    (<title type="letter" corresp="#jjr_to_whh_1845-01-31"><placeName corresp="#DENMARKHL">Denmark Hill</placeName>, <date when="1845-01-31">31 January 1845</date></title>, in

                    Now, when Ruskin departed for <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> in <date when="1845-04">April 1845</date>, 
                        his first Continental tour without his parents&#x02BC; direct supervision, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> grew more outspoken about losing interest in verse composition. 
                        Although continuing to oblige his father by sending home new poems for publication, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> paraded his indifference and even contempt: 
                        &#x201C;Of course do all that you like with poems. <persName corresp="#MGBLESSINGTON">Lady B[lessington]</persName> just as good as any one. I have neither pride nor pleasure in them&#x201D;. 
                        On his father&#x02BC; birthday, he wrote less flippantly, but more decisively, explaining that his poetical impulse was dulled by a critical temper, which he regarded as superior: 
                    &#x201C;I almost always see two sides of a thing at once, now&#x2014;in matters poetical&#x2014;&#x0026; I never get strongly excited without perceiving drawbacks &#x0026; imperfections 
                    which somehow one lost sight of when one was younger&#x201D;
