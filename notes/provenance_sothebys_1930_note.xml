                <head type="title">Sotheby's Sale of Ruskin Manuscripts and Library, 1930</head>
                <p>On 24 July 1930, Sotheby &#x0026; Co. held an important sale of Ruskin's literary remains, described in the catalogue's title as the 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#SOTHEBYCAT1930"><hi rend="italic">Manuscripts and Remaining Library of John Ruskin, Removed from His Residence, Brantwood, Coniston, and Sold with the Consent of Arthur Severn, Esq., and of His Trustees</hi></ref>. 
                    This sale was perhaps the single most consequential event for the provenance of the early manuscripts.</p>
                <p>The first 109 lots of the sale contained items from Ruskin's library, of which more than half (lots 24&#x2013;83) was devoted to "The Kate Greenaway Collection from Brantwood," while the remainder ranged 
                    from illuminated manuscripts and incunabula to modern first editions and presentation copies. As indicated by a copy of the catalogue at the Beinecke Library 
                    that was annotated by an observer during the sale, coveted items fetching high prices in this part of the sale included the Greenaway books  
                    and a copy of William Blake's illustrated edition of Young's <hi rend="italic">Night Thoughts</hi>, its engravings "coloured by the artist himself." 
                    Sotheby's must have anticipated that the Greenaway collection would command interest, having devoted four of the six plates in the illustrated catalogue to drawings from her books, 
                    as compared with only two plates showing Ruskin manuscripts. 
                    Still, as suggested by the final selling prices noted in the Beinecke copy of the catalogue, the Ruskin manuscripts reserved for the second half of the sale were considered the gems of the occasion. 
                    Whereas the highest prices in the first part of the sale included &#x00A3;400 for the Blake <hi rend="italic">Night Thoughts</hi> and &#x00A3;420 for a collection 
                    autograph letters from Greenaway to Ruskin, prices for the Ruskin manuscripts ranged from &#x00A3;440 for the manuscript of <hi rend="italic">The Stones of Venice</hi>, 
                    &#x00A3;520 for a collection of Ruskin's letters to his father, and &#x00A3;1,600 for Ruskin's diaries.</p>
                <p>The Ruskin manuscript portion of the sale was advertised in the catalogue as the 
                    "Ruskin Manuscripts from Brantwood: A large and highly important collection of autograph letters, diaries, note-books, poems, etc., 
                    including the original manuscript notes and sketches for 'The Stones of Venice,' 'Fors Clavigera,' 'Praeterita,' and numerous other works, extending from 1827 to the end of Ruskin's working life in 1889" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#SOTHEBYCAT1930">Sotheby &#x0026; Co., <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Manuscripts and Remaining Library of John Ruskin</hi></ref>, 18). 
                    The sale was divided into lots 110&#x2013;22, of which the following pertain to the contents of the <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> archive:</p>
                    <list type="ordered">
                        <item n="1">Lot 110, "Letters to His Father, John James Ruskin," items 1&#x2013;6 as numbered in the catalogue, 
                            each item consisting of a 4<hi rend="super">o</hi> blue-morocco and gilt binding containing letters, 6 volumes in total. 
                            Item 1, the first volume, entitled in the catalogue as "Early Poems," corresponds to 
                            <ref type="ms" target="msxi.html">MS XI</ref>. The catalogue description does not mention that W. G. Collingwood had assigned a roman-numeral designation to this collection in 
                            &#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D; (see <ref type="essay" target="editing_essay">Introductory Essay on Editing and Bibliography</ref>; and 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="title_citation_for_major_mss_note.xml">System of Title Citation for Manuscripts</ref>); 
                            and indeed, while Collingwood's 1891 description of MS XI as an 
                            "envelope containing collected loose papers"  had been updated in the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.html">Library Edition</ref> 
                            as "now [in 1903] bound up in a volume of letters and poems" (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, 2:534),</ref> 
                            by 1930 even that description had become inaccurate, owing to rebinding (see 
                            <ref type="ms" target="msxi.html#DESCRIPTION">MS XI: Description</ref>). That this first volume of the six in
                            lot 110 includes the items in Collingwood's "envelope" is clear, however, 
                            from the catalogue description of "Early Poems (8), beginning with 'Look at that Ship,' dated Feb. or March, 1828, when Ruskin was nine years old," along with 137 letters, 1829&#x2013;59.</item>
                        <item n="2">Lot 111, "Holograph Diaries and Notebooks," items 1&#x2013;27</item><!-- Finish with diaries relevant to ERM -->
                        <item n="3">Lot 112, "Early Poems and Juvenilia," items I&#x2013;VI, each item consisting of a blue-morocco slipcase, which contained manuscripts as follows. 
                            (The slipcases are not individually described in the catalogue, but they remain along with their original contents at the Beinecke Library. Starting in the 1990s, to guard against wear, 
                            the manuscripts were no longer stored inside the slipcases.) As the catalogue acknowledges (p. 20), to describe the manuscripts, it relies on Collingwood's 
                            &#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891) 
                            (see <ref type="essay" target="editing_essay">Introductory Essay on Editing and Bibliography</ref>; and 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="title_citation_for_major_mss_note.xml">System of Title Citation for Manuscripts</ref>), 
                            citing Collingwood's roman-numeral designations for the respective manuscripts, and borrowing condensed versions of his descriptions of the contents (items I.1&#x2013;3, 5; II&#x2013;V). 
                            Only the sizes and physical descriptions use Sotheby's own, more exacting terms. 
                            It is noteworthy that, in context of rare-book and manuscript dealing, Collingwood's edition remained authoritative, 
                            and the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.xml">Library Edition</ref> is not mentioned, although the latter documents items I.4 and VI, 
                            which Collingwood's &#x201C;Preliminary Note&#x201D; omits. This is a sign, perhaps, that few scholars had mastered the vast detail of the Library Edition.</item>

                                    containing "three note books." Given the existence of this slipcase at the time the catalogue was compiled, the three notebooks can be presumed to be the same as the manuscripts now 
                                    associated with that slipcase in the Beinecke Library, as follows. As in item I.4 above, the catalogue does not draw on existing descriptions that were available in the 
                                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.xml">Library Edition</ref>, 
                                    although admittedly the reference is rather deeply buried in the bibliography volume 
                                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 38:206). 
                                    The catalogue describes the notebooks as a group: &#x201C;74&#x2013;84&#x2013;84 pp. containing geological, historical and grammatical notes, 
                                    half roan, 6 &#x00D7; 4 in.&#x201D; This summary of the contents credibly, if only roughly, corresponds to the Latin grammar, mineralogy, travel itineraries, and sermon drafts in fact 
                                    contained in these manuscripts. The material &#x201C;half roan&#x201D; is incorrect, however&#x2014;the notebooks being full roan, like the 
                                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.xml">Red Books</ref> in I.1&#x2013;5, above&#x2014;and the catalogue's page count of the notebooks 
                                    only very roughly approximates the 44 leaves, 42 leaves, and 43 leaves respectively found in them, as follows. The catalogue may afford a clue, however, that a 
                                    leaf now missing from the third of these notebooks was still attached at the time of the sale, since that possibility would account for the catalogue's identical 
                                    &#x201C;84&#x2013;84 pp.&#x201D; for two of the notebooks:</item>

                <p>The manuscripts listed in lots 110, 112, and 114, as described in the catalogue with their slipcases and bindings, are now held by the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University.  
                    When first acquired, these lots, in the eyes of the Yale curators, would have formed a unit tied together not only by their contents, which all relate to Ruskin's youth, but even by their blue-morocco casings, 
                    which appear to be unique to these manuscripts. Whoever was originally responsible for this choice of bindings probably did perceive the manuscripts as forming a group, 
                    a perception likely founded in Collingwood's bibliographical preparation for the <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891) 
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_brantwood_note_html">Provenance of Early Manuscripts at Denmark Hill and Brantwood</ref>.</p>
                <p>While lots 110 112, and 114 ended up at Yale, the identity of their initial buyer, and the details of the manuscripts’ journey between London and New Haven, are obscured by conflicting evidence. 
                    Lot 112, containing the twelve "little notebooks," was, according to Charles Beecher Hogan, 
                    "purchased by Mr. Charles Goodspeed," the Boston book dealer, "en bloc at Sotheby's," "and in turn purchased by Yale." Hogan also notes that Yale acquired the 
                    <hi rend="italic">King of the Golden River</hi> manuscript through Goodspeed. The volumes of letters, lot 110, however, Hogan says 
                    "were purchased by Yale at the Sotheby auction of July 24, 1930," suggesting that Yale did not go through Goodspeed for these manuscripts 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#YALECOLLECTION">Hogan, "Yale Collection of the Manuscripts of John Ruskin"</ref>, 62, 65, 63). 
                    Curiously, in Goodspeed's memoir, the dealer acknowledges acquiring the manuscripts of <hi rend="italic">The King of the Golden River</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi> (Lot 121), 
                    and a portion of <hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi> (Lot 118) at the 1930 auction, 
                    but he fails to mention the letters and the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.xml">Red Books</ref>. Goodspeed writes: 
                    "<hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi> I kept myself," from this sale; “the others I sold,” he summarizes 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#YANKEEBOOKSELLER">Goodspeed, <hi rend="italic">Yankee Bookseller</hi></ref>, 267). 
                    If Hogan is correct, the "others" must have included Lot 112 containing the Red Books, as well, but Hogan is almost certainly incorrect about that lot coming to Yale through Goodspeed.</p>
                <p>I have seen evidence at the Beinecke Library that, on 6 November 1930, Yale University Library 
                    acquired from Goodspeed eight items that had been auctioned three months earlier at the Sotheby's sale. The list, which confirms Goodspeed's comment in his memoir, 
                    includes <hi rend="italic">The King of the Golden River</hi>, 
                    but not the juvenilia in lot 112.<note>The other seven items invoiced to Yale are the manuscripts of <hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi> (lot 118), 
                        <hi rend="italic">Proserpina</hi> (lot 117), Oxford lectures (lot 116), 
                        lectures on the Val d'Arno (lot 116); 13 "miscellaneous notebooks," grouped as lot 122, and an "architectural notebook" (lot 116); and 
                        Ruskin's set of the <hi rend="italic">Botanical Magazine</hi>, with marginalia (lot 16). All these items, 
                        according to a copy of the Sotheby's catalogue at the Beinecke that was annotated during the sale, were sold to the firm of B. F. Stevens &#x0026; Brown for a total of &#x00A3;188 
                        (in the catalogue, the lot containing the magazine set is not glossed, but it did go to Stevens &#x0026; Brown according to  
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#RUSKINBEMBRIDGEBRANTWOOD">Dearden, <hi rend="italic">Ruskin, Bembridge, and Brantwood</hi></ref>, 48). 
                        The <hi rend="italic">King of the Golden River</hi> manuscript cost this buyer almost as much as the rest, at &#x00A3;155. 
                        Goodspeed turned all this around to Yale for &#x0024;3,000&#x2014;throwing in, apparently as a kind of bonus, a collection of 47 autograph Ruskin letters, chiefly to Benjamin Jowett. 
                        The latter had no connection to the Sotheby sale that is detectable in the catalogue.</note> 
                    These items acquired by Yale in November were sold at auction, according to the annotated sale catalogue at the Beinecke, to "Stevens B. F." This is the firm of B. F. Stevens &#x0026; Brown. 
                    Goodspeed mentions that this firm served as his agent in the 1931 sales 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#YANKEEBOOKSELLER">Goodspeed, <hi rend="italic">Yankee Bookseller</hi></ref>, 268), and 
                    the Beinecke holds correspondence between the proprietor, Ralph Brown, and Goodspeed starting in that year; as the evidence shows, however, the relationship reached back farther to the 1930 sale, 
                    if not earlier.</p>
                <p>It was only a few years earlier, in 1927, that Ralph Brown had established what would prove a thirty-year relationship with the important English Ruskin collector, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="whitehouse_j_h_note.html">J. H. Whitehouse</ref> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#RUSKINBEMBRIDGEBRANTWOOD">Dearden, <hi rend="italic">Ruskin, Bembridge, and Brantwood</hi></ref>, 43&#x2013;44). 
                    In 1930, Whitehouse himself attended the Sotheby's sale and bid in his own name 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#RUSKINBEMBRIDGEBRANTWOOD">Dearden, <hi rend="italic">Ruskin, Bembridge, and Brantwood</hi></ref>, 49), 
                    and so Stevens &#x0026; Brown would have been free to work on commission for Goodspeed, if such was the arrangement. While there was doubtless rivalry between Goodspeed, Whitehouse, and other collectors, 
                    however, B. F. Stevens &#x0026; Brown appears to have been bound to them by respect for Ruskin. A key figure in these relationships was Hugh Allen, who, on his death in August 1931, 
                    Brown remembered to Goodspeed as "our friend" and "a sad loss to Ruskin lovers as his knowledge and kindly interest was always at the disposal of those, who like himself, admired the great Victorian" 
                    (AL, Brown to Goodspeed, 29 August 1931).</p><!-- don't know what this collection is named -->
                <p>It was probably Hugh Allen who acquired lot 112, the juvenilia, at the 1930 sale. According to the annotated sale catalogue at the Beinecke, the successful bid was place by "Allen" for &#x00A3;260, 
                    who also acquired lot 110 (the letters) for &#x00A3;520. Allen’s part in the 1930&#x2013;31 Sotheby's sales can be gathered from a letter by Ralph Brown to J. H. Whitehouse, 
                    on the occasion of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_severn_1931_note.html">Severn Sale of Ruskin Effects, 1931</ref>: 
                    “we are having the benefit of the assistance of our friend Mr Hugh Allen, 
                    and his help has been invaluable,” as compared with “the lack of interest shown by the Severn family in all matters pertaining to Ruskin” 
                    (quoted in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#RUSKINBEMBRIDGEBRANTWOOD">Dearden, <hi rend="italic">Ruskin, Bembridge, and Brantwood</hi></ref>, 87). 
                    Thus, while there is no evidence supporting Hogan's claim that Yale bought lot 112,<note>The provenance of lot 112 is not Hogan's only error; he also declares that the <hi rend="italic">Proserpina</hi> 
                        manuscript and studies “were sold at Sotheby’s on May 18, 1931, and came to Yale by purchase from Mr. Goodspeed” 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#YALECOLLECTION">Hogan, "Yale Collection of the Manuscripts of John Ruskin"</ref>, 67 n. 4). 
                        A part of this manuscript did come from the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1931">Sotheby's Sale of Ruskin Manuscripts, 1931</ref> via Goodspeed, 
                        but the holding started with lot 117 from the 1930 sale, as explained above.</note> the Red Books, from Goodspeed, it is possible that Goodspeed served as a conduit between Yale and Allen, 
                    in supplying the university library with both lots 112 and 110 from the Sotheby's sale. 
                    Whatever Goodspeed's involvement, if any, the lots came to Yale from Allen as a unit, as they are treated together 
                    in the earliest published report on Yale’s acquisitions from the July 1930 sale. Appearing in January 1931, the report 
                    treats the juvenilia along with the letters as a single “collection” (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#COLLECTIONRUSKINMANUSCRIPTS">Weihe, "A Collection of Ruskin Manuscripts"</ref>). 
                    What remains enigmatic is that this published report makes no mention of the several items, including the <hi rend="italic">King of the Golden River</hi> manuscript, 
                    which Goodspeed certainly did sell to the library the previous November.</p>
                <p>Whomever or whatever interest Allen represented, his expenditure on lots 110 and 112 was significant, attesting to the value placed on these early manuscripts, 
                    presumably for their biographical interest. At &#x00A3;520, 
                    the letters fetched the second highest price of the manuscript lots after the &#x00A3;1,600 for the diaries, higher even than the &#x00A3;440 paid for the <hi rend="italic">Stones of Venice</hi> 
                    materials. The &#x00A3;260 for the Red Books was significantly more than what B. F. Stevens paid for the <hi rend="italic">King of the Golden River</hi> and the 
                    <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi> manuscripts, at &#x00A3;155 and &#x00A3;166, respectively. Insofar as prices serve as a measure, manuscripts related to Ruskin's youth that the author referenced 
                    in the autobiography were valued more than 
                    the manuscript of the autobiography itself. (Goodspeed clung to the <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi> manuscript, and treasured it, however; and it is interesting that, 
                    while prices for the late works were, not surprisingly, comparatively low, Hogan's 1942 article treated "the possession of the manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi> 
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi>" as what "makes the Yale collection truly rich" 
                    [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#YALECOLLECTION">Hogan, "Yale Collection of the Manuscripts of John Ruskin"</ref>, 68].) It is possible, moreover, that the comparatively high prices 
                    for the early manuscripts was the effect not only of the interest in Ruskin's youth that the author himself had encouraged through his autobiographical writing, but also of the broader 
                    phenomenon of <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.html">The Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth
