                    their first ambitious tour of the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName> occurred <date notBefore="1833-05-10" notAfter="1833-09-22">between May and September 1833</date>. 
                    The tour therefore fell only a few years after the <date notBefore="1830-07-26" notAfter="1830-07-29">July Revolution</date> in <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> 
                    and the <date notBefore="1830-08-25" notAfter="1831-07-14">Belgian Revolution of 1830</date>.

                <p>The Ruskin traveling party included, besides <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and his parents,

                    On the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName>, they enjoyed the services of a cicerone, named <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="salvador_note.php"><persName corresp="#SALVADOR">Salvador</persName></ref>; 
                    and in <date when="1833">1833</date>, as in <date when="1825">1825</date>, the family benefited from the rapid rise of efficent and inexpensive travel to the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName> by steam. 
                    For these developments in travel across the <placeName corresp="#ENGLISHCHANNEL">English Channel</placeName>, which the Ruskins enjoyed 
                    along with thousands of middle&#x2010;class British travelers in the decades after the <date when="1815-06-18">Battle of <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName></date>,

                    In <date when="1833">1833</date>, steam packets departed daily between <date notBefore="1833-04" notAfter="1833-11">April and November</date> for <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName> 
                    from the <placeName corresp="#TOWEROFLONDON">Tower of London</placeName>, and five days per week from <geogName corresp="#DOVERCLF">Dover</geogName>, 
                    which was where the Ruskins boarded. Traveling to <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName> in the same year as the Ruskins,

                <p>Besides relying on their courier, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="salvador_note.php"><persName corresp="#SALVADOR">Salvador</persName></ref>, the Ruskins carried guidebooks, 
                    which in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1835">1820s through the mid&#x2010;1830s</date> were undergoing a transition. 
                    The vade mecum for English travelers landing in <placeName corresp="#NORMANDY">Normandy</placeName> 
                    and the Low Countries, <persName corresp="#JM">John Murray</persName>&#x02BC;s

                    did not become available until <date when="1836">1836</date>. Whereas <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    <title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book</hi></title> is now often credited with founding the genre of the modern English traveler&#x02BC;s guidebook, 
                    for earlier journeys like the Ruskins&#x02BC;, taken after the reopening of the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName> following the <date when="1815-06-18">Battle of <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName></date> in  
                    <date notBefore="1815" notAfter="1836">1815 and continuing through the mid&#x2010;1830s</date>, travelers relied on publications that combined personal travel narrative with some practical advice. 
                    As <persName corresp="#PF">Pieter Fran&#x00E7;ois</persName> has shown, in the period prior to the publication of <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book</hi></title>, 
                    there appeared numerous examples of the guidebook genre, particularly relating to the Low Countries, but in an emergent and somewhat inchoate form. 
                    Only gradually, after <date when="1815-06-18">Waterloo</date>, the modern guidebook emerged as a genre distinct from the so&#x2010;called 
                    <hi rend="italic">travel account</hi>, in that the guidebook came to offer mainly practical travel advice, 
                    whereas the more traditional travel account emphasized topographical description and narrative from an individual perspective 
                    (albeit not too individualistic, lest decorum and authority seem to succumb to eccentricity). In the immediate <date notBefore="1815-06-18">post&#x2010;Waterloo</date> period, 
                    these genres were often mixed in the same book, with traces of the <date notBefore="1701" notAfter="1800">eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> travel account governing the narrative (for example, in the adoption of an epistolary form), 
                    while tables of practical advice were added to recommend the book in a crowded field 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRANCOIS1815"><persName corresp="#PF">Fran&#x00E7;ois</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#FRANCOIS1815">&#x201C;If It&#x02BC;s <date when="1815">1815</date>, This Must Be <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName>&#x201D;</title></ref>, 76&#x2013;82).
                </p>
                <p>This transitional and eclectic period of travel writing is reflected in the Ruskins&#x02BC; book purchases, 
                    both before setting out on their <date when="1833">1833</date> journey and following their return. Besides arming themselves with a German grammar book, 
                    the Ruskins carried a work by <persName corresp="#MSA">Mariana Starke</persName> (<date notBefore="1762" notAfter="1838">1762&#x2013;1838</date>), 
                    whose travel books both <persName corresp="#PF">Fran&#x00E7;ois</persName> and <persName corresp="#JB">James Buzard</persName> characterize as typical of the transitional period 
                    of travel writing, displaying characteristics both of the guidebook and the travel account, 
                    and whose work <persName corresp="#CB">Charles Batten</persName> similarly describes as moving away from the decorum of the <date notBefore="1701" notAfter="1800">eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> travel account 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRANCOIS1815"><persName corresp="#PF">Fran&#x00E7;ois</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#FRANCOIS1815">&#x201C;If It&#x02BC;s <date when="1815">1815</date>, This Must Be <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName>&#x201D;</title></ref>, 76, 90;

                    The <persName corresp="#MSA">Starke</persName> work acquired by the Ruskins may have been <title type="book" corresp="#STARKETRAVELS"><hi rend="italic">Travels in <geogName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</geogName></hi></title>, a popular guidebook first published by

                    to the form of the modern guidebook. Even <persName corresp="#MSA">Starke</persName>&#x02BC;s much earlier success, <title type="book" corresp="#STARKEITALY" rend="italic">Travels in <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName></title> 
                    (<date when="1800">1800</date>), had been &#x201C;felt by many before the rise of the <orgName corresp="#MURRAY">Murray</orgName> 
                    and <orgName corresp="#BAEDEKER">Baedeker</orgName> guides to be the best available vade&#x2010;mecum for <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>.&#x201D; 
                    This work, <persName corresp="#JB">Buzard</persName> says, &#x201C;was by no means single&#x2010;mindedly devoted to the role of &#x2018;handbook.&#x2019;&#x201D; 
                    It was characteristic of the transitional period of travel writing, in having &#x201C;the appearance, 
                    when we look back at it with generic presuppositions founded on <orgName corresp="#MURRAY">Murray</orgName> and <orgName corresp="#BAEDEKER">Baedeker</orgName>, 
                    of an impressionistic &#x2018;travel book&#x2019;&#x201D;&#x2014;that is, as still relying, despite its &#x201C;serving as a makeshift [modern] &#x2018;handbook&#x2019; 
                    in the absence of any alternative,&#x201D; on such <date notBefore="1701" notAfter="1800">eighteenth&#x2010;century></date> conventions as a series of letters containing the traveler&#x02BC;s personal impressions 
                    balanced by judicious reflection (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BUZARDBEATEN"><persName corresp="#JB">Buzard</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#BUZARDBEATEN"><hi rend="italic">Beaten Track</hi></title></ref>, 68, and see 69&#x2013;70).

                    <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#COLOGNE">Cologne</placeName>, which the Ruskins followed in order to access the 
                    <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>; for while <persName corresp="#MSA">Starke</persName>&#x02BC;s updated guide did supply information on 
                    <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName> and many other regions of <geogName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</geogName> in an appendix, the main text remained traditionally focused on getting the traveler

                        The law which authorizes unrestrained license of tongue and pen, both public and pbrivate, on all subjects, whether political or religious,

                        The former probably refers to a castle that, according to John Murray writing in the 1830s, remained "in good preservation above the town" of Werdenberg, and that "was the seat of a noble family . . . 
                        who played an important part in early Swiss history," whereas the latter was a mineral springs spa that presented "<hi rend="italic">one of the most extraordinary spots in Switzerland</hi>

                        The physician and travel writer, William Beattie (1793-1875), described Bad Pf&#x00E4;fers (today called the Tamina Gorge) as a "golden fleece guarded by a frightful dragon," 
                        approached through a "wild scene . . . without competitor among the many savage regions to which the human foot has found access," yet affording in its waters 
                        medicinal virtues that "in numerous cases . . . , in pharmaceutic principles, [are] . . . impossible to explain"

                        For poetry about their tours, both writers turned to the St. Bernard, about which <persName corresp="#WBI">William Brockedon</persName> wrote: "no passage of the Alps . . . 
                        affords to the traveller greater pleasure, either in the enjoyment or the recollection of his journey to Italy" (or pleasurable anticipation, in the case of Rogers's speaker), 
                        "for besides the wildness of this Alpine pass, and the beauty of the valley of Aosta, . . . the kind reception which . . . [the traveler] experiences from the religious community at the hospice, 
                        is remembered as long as he can be grateful for the devotion . . . [of] these excellent men
