                <p>In <date when="1825">1825</date>, when John was six, the Ruskin family made its first visit to the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName>. 
                    According to Van Akin Burd, the family party included John's nurse, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="strachan_anne_note.html"><persName corresp="#ASB">Anne Strachan</persName></ref>, who accompanied the family also on the <date when="1833">1833</date> journey; 
                    and they journeyed between 11 May and 13 July. 
                    The itinerary covered Calais, Bruges, Ghent, Brussels, and <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName>, including <placeName corresp="#VERSAILLES">Versailles</placeName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 1:xxv;

                    As such, the tour was characteristically post&#x2010;Napoleonic, organized around paying tribute to the Allies' victory on Waterloo Field 
                    and witnessing the festivities in Paris to celebrate the crowning of Charles X. As the first coronation since the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy--Charles's brother, Louis XVIII, 
                    had died after being restored to the throne less than a decade following the Allies' victory--the ceremony itself took place in May at the cathedral in Reims, 
                    where French monarchs were traditionally anointed, and not in Paris, where Napoleon had crowned himself emperor in Notre Dame. In Britain, 
                    where Charles had lived in exile in London and Edinburgh, theaters staged replicas of the Reims Cathedral ceremony; and in Paris, 
                    the operatic theater of the coronation was mirrored in spectacles mounted in the opera houses

                <p>In his travel diary for 1833, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> reflected back on this <date when="1825">1825</date> journey, 
                    comparing their experiences during the much more ambitious Continental <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1833_note.html">Tour of <date when="1833">1833</date></ref>. 
                    On this present visit, he notes that <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName> was &#x201C;not so gay as in <date when="1825-05">May 1825</date>&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#RFMS33A">Diary of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>,<date notBefore="1833" notAfter="1846">1833&#x2013;46</date></ref>, 72, 73). 
                    In his autobiography, Praeterita, Ruskin acknowledged that the trip was prompted by the coronation festivities, but he remembered nothing of the pomp, 
                    claiming to have been "only interested by things near me, or at least clearly visible and present", such as the good-natured servants at the Paris hotel 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 35:104).</p>
                
                <p>A journey to the Continent may seem ambitious for a middle&#x2010;class <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> family, only recently established (since 1823) in their new suburban home, 
                    Herne Hill, and with a young boy to raise and educate. By the <date notBefore="1825" notAfter="1829">mid&#x2010;1820s</date>, however, 
                    <geogName corresp="#ENGLISHCHANNEL">Channel</geogName> crossings were common, if limited to the nearby and comparatively inexpensive destination of the Kingdom of the Netherlands 
                    (<placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName> did not secede and form a nation until 1830). Trips expressly to view the <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName> battlefield
                    had been popular since as early as the weeks immediately following the battle. The popularity had been enhanced by personal visits paid by such well&#x2010;known literary figures as 
                    <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>, <persName corresp="#RS">Robert Southey</persName>, and <persName corresp="#GGB">Lord Byron</persName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#FRANCOIS1815">Fran&#x00E7;ois, &#x201C;If It&#x02BC;s 1815, This Must Be <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName>&#x201D;</ref>, 74&#x2013;75, 89). 
                    The year of the Ruskins&#x02BC; crossing is noted as a watershed for middle&#x2010;class British travel by historians studying the opening of <placeName corresp="#NETHERLANDS">Netherlands</placeName>, 
                    <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName>, and northern <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>, 
                    since more rapid crossings were made possible by the rise of steam packet lines. The steam packets accommodated large excursion parties along with individual travelers, 
                    providing amenities such as food and drink and even entertainment, with music performance being common onboard 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#WILLIAMSARMSTRONGSTEAM">Williams and Armstrong, &#x201C;Steam Shipping and the Beginnings of Overseas Tourism&#x201D;</ref>). 
                    For travelers of modest means, the steam lines greatly increased the efficiency, reliability, and carrying capacity, improvements that were critical 
                    for travelers who could take holidays from employment only on a limited budget and for definite periods--a point expressly made by John James Ruskin in March 1825, 
                    determined to "chuse Summer in future for any little Travelling" with his family, since he suffered chill, weariness, and loneliness from his business travel during the autumn and winter months
