               <head type="title">Hill of Kinnoull (Place)</head>
                    <p>A hill in <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>, with a <geogName corresp="#KINNOULLCRAG">dramatic cliff face</geogName> overlooking the <geogName corresp="#TAYRIV">Tay River</geogName>.</p>
                    <p>In <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MEMORABILIAOFPERTH"><title type="book" corresp="#MEMORABILIAOFPERTH"><hi rend="italic">Memorabilia of the City of Perth</hi></title> (<date when="1806">1806</date>)</ref>, two
                        excursions were recommended respecting the <geogName corresp="#KINNOULLHL">hill</geogName>, one at its base, and the other to its summit. The excursion around its base started &#x201C;by a path which leads
                        entirely round the <geogName corresp="#MONCRIEFFHL">Hill of Moncrieff</geogName>. As far as we ride eastward, we accompany the
                        <geogName corresp="#TAYRIV">Tay</geogName>, which flows smoothly under the sublime <geogName corresp="#KINNOULLCRAG">Crag of Kinnoull</geogName>, with which it unites to
                        form a scene of uncommon grandeur. As the road turns round the hill, the view, formerly confined, now magnificently expands&#x201D;. Formerly located &#x201C;at
                        the bottom of the hill, on the bank of the <geogName corresp="#TAYRIV">river</geogName> opposite the <placeName corresp="#SINCH">South Inch</placeName>&#x201D;,
                        stood the <placeName corresp="#KINNOULCAS">Castle of Kinnoul</placeName>, &#x201C;but the plough has now removed every vestige of this edifice&#x201D; (pp. 36, 43).</p>
                    <p>The excursion to the summit was to be reserved for a full afternoon, but not because the climb was onerous: &#x201C;The road
                        to the summit is no where steep or rugged enough to overpower the most delicate inhabitant of drawing&#x2010;rooms. <placeName corresp="#MONTAGUE">Montague Walk</placeName>, winding through the wood nearly one half
                        of the way, is too pleasant to permit any idea of fatigue. But, should any slight sensation of that kind be experienced, the view from the summit will repay such an
                        expence a thousand fold&#x201D;. After quoting <name type="fictional" corresp="#EDGARSHAKESPEARELEAR">Edgar</name>&#x02BC;s description in act 4 of <title type="drama" corresp="#SHAKESPEARELEAR"><hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi></title> 
                        of the dizzy view from the <geogName corresp="#DOVERCLF">Cliffs of Dover</geogName>, the writer declares that, 
                        to complete the comparison, only the &#x201C;noble river&#x201D;, the <geogName corresp="#TAYRIV">Tay</geogName>, need be subsituted for the ocean in <persName corresp="#WSP">Shakespeare</persName>&#x02BC;s lines (pp. 42&#x2013;43).</p>
