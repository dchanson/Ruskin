                <p><persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> was born in the Scottish border county of <placeName corresp="#ROXBURGHSHIRE">Roxburghshire</placeName>.

                    and he became known for his poetry evoking rural life in <placeName corresp="#SAFRICA">South Africa</placeName>. On <date when="1834-06-28">28 June 1834</date>, the day following his signing of the official proclamation ending slavery in the British Empire, 
                    and thus consummating his life&#x02BC;s work dedicated to abolition, <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> experienced distress that he interpreted as a &#x201C;crumb of bread&#x201D; going down &#x201C;the wrong throat,&#x201D; 
                    but that proved to be a sign of advancing tuberculosis, leading to his death before the end of the year

                <p>It was while making his way as an editor in the <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> literary scene of the <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1833">late 1820s and early 1830s</date> that <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> encountered the Ruskin family. 
                    <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> became editor of <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></ref>  
                    in <date when="1828">1828</date>, starting his responsibilities with the volume for <date when="1829">1829</date> 
                    (that is, the volume that became available for purchase in <date notBefore="1828-10" notAfter="1828-11">October or Novemeber 1828</date>, intended for <date notBefore="1828-12" notAfter="1829-01">the holiday season of 1828&#x2013;29</date>).

                    under the editorship of <persName corresp="#CK">Charles Knight</persName>. When <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> took over, he remained editor until his death in <date when="1834-12">December 1834</date>, 
                    having already prepared the volume for <date when="1835">1835</date>&#x2014;the volume in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poems appeared&#x2014;and  
                    and sent it to press in <date when="1834-08">August 1834</date>

                    During his illness in this final year of his editorship, <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> was assisted by 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="inglis_henry_note.php">Henry D. Inglis (1795&#x2013;1835)</ref>, 
                    and therefore the Ruskins may have had some contact with this writer and editor, as well, in preparing <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s first poems for a widely distributed public venue.
                </p>
                <p>Precisely how <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s acquaintance with the Ruskins came about is unknown. 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s later reminiscences of <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> are subordinated to wry rhetorical purposes. First, in the <date when="1878">1878</date> <title type="essay" corresp="#RUSKINMYFIRSTEDITOR">&#x201C;My First Editor: An Autobiographical Reminiscence,&#x201D;</title> 
                    <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> appears as prelude to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s tribute to 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="harrison_w_h_note.php">W. H. Harrison (ca. 1792&#x2013;1878)</ref>, 
                    the poet and editor with whom <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> maintained a much longer professional relationship, 
                    and who succeeded <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> as one of the stewards of <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi> for <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>. 
                    Second, in <date notBefore="1885" notAfter="1889">1885&#x2013;89</date>, in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s autobiography, 
                    <title type="autobiography" corresp="#PRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s story is involved in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s self-irony and satire about his fledgling career as a poet, 
                    a vocation that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> ultimately rejected, but that his father cherished and had attempted to nourish in company with men like <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> and <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>.
                </p>
                <p>As <persName corresp="#RV">Rudolphe Vigne</persName> points out, in his monograph on <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>, the association between <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> and the Ruskins would have rested on their shared Scottish heritage and literary interests, 
                    and <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> may have centered his high regard more on <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> than on <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>. 
                    To document this friendship, <persName corresp="#RV">Vigne</persName> has uncovered a letter (unfortunately undated), 
                    in which <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> mentions &#x201C;my friend <persName corresp="#JJR">Mr Ruskin</persName> of the house of <orgName corresp="#RUSKINETAL">Domecq and Co.</orgName>, . . . the greatest sherry merchants in <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>. I have drunk at <persName corresp="#JJR">Mr Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s table 
                    sherry 80 years old, and which sells at 26 shillings a bottle&#x201D;

                    A key figure in these connections may have been <persName corresp="#AE">Alexander Elder</persName> (<date when="1790">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876">1876</date>), 
                    one of the founding partners of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>. The firm&#x02BC;s counting house was located around the corner from the premises of 
                    <orgName corresp="#RUSKINETAL">Telford, Ruskin, &#x0026; Domecq</orgName>, and <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> would have shared Elder&#x02BC;s artistic interests

                <p>For <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>, a more compelling figure in these connections may have been his cousin,

                <p>This copy of the annual presented by <persName corresp="#CTR">Charles</persName> in <date notBefore="1829-10-21" notAfter="1829-10-31">late October 1829</date> would probably have been the recently published volume &#x201C;for <date when="1830">1830</date>,&#x201D; one of the volumes edited by <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> 
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></ref>). 
                    It contained contributions by his longtime friend, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="hogg_james_note.php"><persName>James Hogg</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1770" notAfter="1835">1770&#x2013;1835</date>)</ref>, 
                    whom <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> was likely responsible for introducing personally to the Ruskins at <placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName>, 
                    sometime between <date notBefore="1832-01-14" notAfter="1832-02-19">14 January and 19 February 1832</date>. 
                    In <date when="1834">1834</date>, this connection proved significant for the Ruskins&#x2014;at least as significant as another great man with whom 
                    <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> remained more closely associated in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s memory&#x2014;namely, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="rogers_samuel_note.php">Samuel Rogers (1763&#x2013;1855)</ref>, to whom 
                    <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> introduced <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> as a prodigy 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 35:93, 34:96&#x2013;97).</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> did admit <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> to his circle, as <persName corresp="#RV">Vigne</persName> confirms (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#VIGNEPRINGLE">Vigne, <title type="biography" corresp="#VIGNEPRINGLE"><hi rend="italic">Thomas Pringle</hi></title></ref>, 191&#x2013;92), 
                    but we have only <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s much later, barbed accounts of the episode, wherein the boy allegedly failed to flatter <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> adequately about the poetry of his topographical volume, <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, 
                    and instead found greater interest in the engraved vignettes for the <date when="1830">1830</date> illustrated edition, and in the pictures on <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s walls. 
                    Accordingly, <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> chided his charge for failing to attend to the conversation of great men.
                    The anecdote may or may not be plausible, but a more significant and fundamental question concerns the motivation and outcome of <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s introduction of the fourteen&#x2010; or fifteen&#x2010;year old boy wonder 
                    to <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s famous palace of art, <placeName corresp="#STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</placeName>, where the poet had entertained the literati of Regency and early Victorian <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>
