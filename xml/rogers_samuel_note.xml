                    He was also famous as a conversationalist and as a patron of artists and other writers. 
                    A wealthy and successful businessman&#x2014;he made his fortune in banking&#x2014;he could afford to craft his polite, formal verse slowly and methodically, 
                    and to promote the classical aesthetic and collecting to which he was fervently devoted. He was a Regency &#x201C;man of taste&#x201D; 
                    who survived into an increasingly earnest generation.</p>

                    <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> used his house to promote the aesthetic of neoclassicism. He commissioned furniture using <persName corresp="#THA">Hope</persName>&#x02BC;s Greek&#x2010; and Roman&#x2010;revival designs, 
                    and some interior features of <placeName corresp="#STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</placeName> were copied directly from <persName corresp="#THA">Hope</persName>&#x02BC;s <placeName corresp="#DUCHESSST">Duchess Street</placeName> house, 
                    a showcase that <persName corresp="#THA">Hope</persName> intended as a model for reforming British taste

                <p>The collection inside <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s museum&#x2010;like residence ranged from Greek and Roman antiquities, to Old Masters, 
                    to eighteenth&#x2010; and nineteenth&#x2010;century British art, to curious objects of virtu. The library was significant for manuscripts, prints, and drawings, 
                    including the complete drawings by <persName corresp="#JFSCULPTOR">John Flaxman</persName> (<date notBefore="1755" notAfter="1826">1755&#x2010;1826</date>) after

                    was a major patron. In his acquisition of paintings and sculpture, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> oversaw a small but representative collection that, 
                    as <persName corresp="#ABJ">Anna Jameson</persName> (<date notBefore="1794" notAfter="1860">1794&#x2013;1860</date>) commented, would serve better to educate a neophyte 
                    in the &#x201C;true comprehension of the characteristic excellences of various painters&#x201D; than would a larger and more imposing collection. Old Master paintings included works by 
                    Italian primitive and Renaissance (especially Venetian) artists; Baroque Flemish and Dutch artists; and landscapists, both classical Arcadian (e.g., <persName corresp="#CLAUDE">Claude</persName> 
                    and <persName corresp="#NP">Poussin</persName>) and Dutch. In British art, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s taste in figure and genre painting inclined to the modern 
                    with pieces by <persName corresp="#RPB">Bonington</persName>, <persName corresp="#JHF">Fuseli</persName>, <persName corresp="#BRH">Haydon</persName>,

                <p><persName corresp="#TSP">Thomas Stothard</persName> was particularly important to <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s collecting and decorating, 
                    supplying not only works for the drawing and painting collections, but also illustrations for <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s own books, 
                    and even objects of interior design. A cabinet painted by him depicted characters from <persName corresp="#WSP">Shakespeare</persName>, <persName corresp="#GCP">Chaucer</persName>, 
                    and <persName corresp="#GBP">Boccaccio</persName>, likely designed in the rococo, <persName corresp="#JAW">Watteauesque</persName> style 
                    that <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName> had favored from his earliest book illustration commissions, and that he termed his <hi rend="italic">sans souci</hi> manner 
                    of his <hi rend="italic">f&#x00EA;te galante</hi> illustrations for the <title type="story" corresp="#BOCCACCIODECAMERON">Decameron</title>

                    <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>&#x02BC;s working relationship with <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> was established as early as <date when="1794">1794</date>, 
                    when the artist supplied a few cuts for an edition of <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSPLEASURES"><hi rend="italic">The Pleasures of Memory</hi></title>, followed by much more profusely illustrated editions of this 
                    and other poems, many of these editions published by the firm of <orgName corresp="#CADELLTHOMAS">Thomas Cadell</orgName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#COXHEADSTOTHARD">Coxhead, <hi rend="italic">Thomas Stothard, R.A.</hi></ref>, 120&#x2013;29). 
                    The artist and patron shared political sympathies, <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName> having been apprenticed in his youth to <placeName corresp="#SPITALSFIELD">Spitalsfield</placeName> radicals and, 
                    as a young artist, formed close friendships with <persName corresp="#JFSCULPTOR">John Flaxman</persName> and <persName corresp="#WBP">William Blake</persName> (<date notBefore="1757" notAfter="1827">1757&#x2010;1827</date>) 
                    and admired <persName corresp="#JBA">James Barry</persName> (<date notBefore="1741" notAfter="1806">1741&#x2010;1806</date>) and <persName corresp="#JHM">John Hamilton Mortimer</persName> (<date notBefore="1740" notAfter="1779">1740&#x2010;79</date>); 
                    <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s associations included some of these artists, as well as influential <orgName corresp="#WHIG">Whig</orgName> politicians 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BENNETTSTOTHARD">Bennett, <hi rend="italic">Thomas Stothard</hi></ref>, 2&#x2013;6, 11&#x2013;12, 23&#x2013;24).</p> 
                <p>The house and collections were open to view by anyone with a respectable introduction, including the young <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, 
                    who was ushered to <placeName corresp="#STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</placeName> by the editor and poet, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="pringle_thomas_note.php">Thomas Pringle (1789&#x2013;1834)</ref>. 
                    Nothing is known about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s first encounter with this arbiter of taste and host of <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> literary and artistic life, 
                    apart from what <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself later related about the incident in the autobiographical writing,

                    Perhaps <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> gained <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s entr&#x00E9;e on the strength of the youth&#x02BC;s remarkable imitation 
                    of the <date when="1830">1830</date> edition of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>,

                    <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> knew about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s project, since he debuted the young poet in the annual, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php"><title type="periodical" corresp="FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title></ref>, 
                    by publishing a version of poems drawn from the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> 
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="pringle_thomas_note.php">Thomas Pringle (1789&#x2013;1834)</ref>; and

                <p><persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s introduction of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> should be viewed in tandem 
                    with <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s recommendation of his son as a future poet to the Scottish poet and fiction writer, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="hogg_james_note.php">James Hogg (ca. 1770&#x2013;1835)</ref>. 
                    It is possible that <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> approached <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> with the intention 
                    of offsetting and correcting <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s introduction of the boy to <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>, 
                    as much as complementing that introduction, since <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> was a homelier and more approachable figure. 
                    Both introductions probably belong to <date notBefore="1833" notAfter="1834">1833&#x2013;34</date>.</p>
                <p>In these earlier years, the significance of the <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> connection revolved around the poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, particularly 
                    the <date when="1830">1830</date> illustrated edition. <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> developed his poem over the course of several years. 
                    Basing its substance on his Continental tour of <date notBefore="1814" notAfter="1815">1814&#x2013;15</date>, he started composition in <date when="1818">1818</date>. 
                    In <date when="1822">1821&#x2013;22</date>, he published <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY1822"><hi rend="italic">Italy, a Poem: Part the First</hi></title> with the publisher, <orgName corresp="#LONGMAN">Longman</orgName>, keeping the authorship anonymous 
                    (although the secret was exposed, to anyone who cared to investigate, by previous piecemeal appearance of portions of the work under <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s name, 
                    such as the lines on <placeName corresp="#PAESTUM">Paestum</placeName>, released in <date when="1819">1819</date> and <date when="1822">1822</date>). 
                    In <date when="1823">1823</date>, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> released the poem under his name in a new edition published by <orgName corresp="#MURRAY">John Murray</orgName>, 
                    which expanded and revised the contents of the <orgName corresp="#LONGMAN">Longman</orgName> <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY1822"><hi rend="italic">Part the First</hi></title>. 
                    Additionally, the first part went into a third edition, <date when="1823">1823</date>; and a fourth edition, with revisions, additions, and two woodcuts by <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>, <date when="1824">1824</date>. 
                    These constant revisions and reissues can be explained in terms of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s perfectionism, which he was able to satisfy by means of his enormous wealth, 
                    and not necessarily in terms of the indifferent reception of the poem, as has sometimes been alleged. While <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> was unlucky to begin composing a long verse work about <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> just at the same time when 
                    <persName corresp="#GGB">Lord Byron</persName> wrote and published the fourth canto of <title type="poem" corresp="#BYRONPILGRIMAGE"><hi rend="italic">Childe Harold&#x02BC;s Pilgrimage</hi></title> (<date when="1818">1818</date>), 
                    in which the more famous poet laid claim to <placeName corresp="#VENICE">Venice</placeName> as a popular topic for verse,

                    this part also published by <orgName corresp="#MURRAY">Murray</orgName>, and illustrated by four woodcuts by <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>. 
                    Within that same year, the poet bought up and destroyed the roughly two thousand unsold copies of both parts 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROGERSJOURNAL">Rogers, <hi rend="italic">Italian Journal</hi></ref>, 109&#x2013;10;

                    The Ruskin family numbered among the exceptional, albeit not exclusive, owners of these earlier editions of the poem, having puchased a copy in 
                    <date when="1828">1828</date>&#x2014;presumably of the second part of the poem, issued in that year 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 1:188 n. 4). 
                    What happened were rapid changes in the literary market, which are instructive about the context in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> began to publish his poetry.</p>
                <p>Whether <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> made a bonfire of the earlier editions of <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> 
                    because he was dismayed by the work&#x02BC;s tepid reception, reviewers having largely treated it coolly or ignored it altogether, 
                    or because he was eager to publish a new, combined and revised version of parts 1 and 2&#x2014;an extravagant approach to revision that was within his means&#x2014;his 
                    decision cannot have been unaffected by the precipitous change in conditions that had favored publication of poetry prior to the <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1829">later 1820s</date>. 
                    As <persName corresp="#LE">Lee Erickson</persName> has argued, in the first two decades of the century, the prestige of British poetry as a genre was supported by an economy of papermaking that 
                    kept the price of books high, thus encouraging consumers to favor a genre that repaid repeated reading of shorter works. Correspondingly, poets advanced a poetics 
                    that singled out an audience of the fit though few. This economy changed abruptly with industrial improvements that cheapened paper as well as making mass print runs possible through stereotyping. 
                    Now publishers encouraged a variety of genres, especially prose genres, in order to appeal to an audience expanding in both numbers and breadth of social class 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ERICKSONECONOMY">Erickson, <hi rend="italic">Economy of Literary Form</hi></ref>, 19&#x2013;48). 
                    <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>, for all his refinement, elitism, and perfectionism&#x2014;indeed, in a certain respect by virtue of those traits&#x2014;was able 
                    to maintain the viability of his poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, by responding to the growing popular market 
                    as an entrepreneur. He did so by capitalizing on another technological innovation of the period, steel engraving, which made possible the mass production of the engraved image, 
                    and which in <persName corresp="#LE">Erickson</persName>&#x02BC;s view deflected what remained of the popular poetry market into the minor subgenre of light lyric, pictorial verse favored by the 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</ref> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ERICKSONECONOMY">Erickson, <hi rend="italic">Economy of Literary Form</hi></ref>, 29&#x2013;31). The medium 
                    made possible two of the most widely distributed and steadily demanded illustrated books of the first half of the century, the 
                    <date when="1830">1830</date> illustrated edition of <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, and the

                <p>While this achievement was owing to <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s unusual ability to manage the fortunes of his poetry in revolutionary market conditions, 
                    and to sustain at least the appearance of elite consumer status attached to his poetry, the possibility that conditions of print and visual culture equally governed 
                    the reception of his poetry is suggested by the most ephemeral of the illustrated versions of <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>. 
                    In <date notBefore="1824-10" notAfter="1824-11">late 1824</date>, there appeared a version of part 1 of the poem, with 12 copper engravings by <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>, 
                    published as the <title type="periodical" corresp="#ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</hi></title> for <date when="1825">1825</date>  
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POWELLTURNERSVIGNETTES">Powell, &#x201C;Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes&#x201D;</ref>, 2; and 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HOLCOMBCLASSICALTURNER">Holcomb, &#x201C;Neglected Classical Phase of Turner&#x02BC;s Art&#x201D;</ref>, 406 n. 2). 
                    This was not an edition of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s complete poem, but an adaptation accommodated to the printed artifact called a <hi rend="italic">pocket book</hi>, 
                    which was an ephemeral publication combining features of an annual almanac with a diary or engagement calendar. The 
                    <title type="periodical" corresp="#ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</hi></title> was an up&#x2010;market example of this kind 
                    of publication, with the almanac material refined to focus on fashionable information such as tables of the members of the British royalty and other dignitaries. 
                    The role played by <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s poem was to embellish the blank diary pages with brief verse extracts, 
                    illustrated by copper&#x2010;engraved vignettes by <persName corresp="#TSP">Thomas Stothard</persName>.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName> had been employed to illustrate the <title type="periodical" corresp="#ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</hi></title> 
                    since <date when="1783">1783</date>, prior to his first cuts for <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSPLEASURES"><hi rend="italic">Pleasures of Memory</hi></title>. 
                    The artist drew on that poem to illustrate the pocket book for <date when="1808">1808</date>, and on <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSHUMANLIFE"><hi rend="italic">Human Life</hi></title> for the <date when="1820">1820</date> issue 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#COXHEADSTOTHARD">Coxhead, <hi rend="italic">Thomas Stothard, R.A.</hi></ref>, 50&#x2013;54). 
                    The publisher, <orgName corresp="#TBS">Thomas Baker</orgName> of <placeName corresp="#SOUTHAMPTON">Southampton</placeName>, appears to have relied on <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName> 
                    to impart the qualities that made this pocket book stand out in the market and maintain unusual longevity&#x2014;the thematizing of each annual issue around a work 
                    of popular British literature, sometimes classic, but most often modern. The literary illustrations were limited to twelve vignettes, each less than one by two inches, 
                    and each one heading the first of a two&#x2010;page spread of diary pages for a given month. Quotations from the literary work were limited to brief captions, 
                    effectively forming part of the vignette itself. Working within these limitations, <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName> pictorially serialized such hefty works 
                    as novels and long narrative poems by <persName corresp="#OG">Goldsmith</persName>, <persName corresp="#WCP">Cowper</persName>, <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName>, 
                    <persName corresp="#GCRABBE">Crabbe</persName>, <persName corresp="#TCAMPBELL">Campbell</persName>, and <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>.

                    Evidence is unclear about what part, if any, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> himself played in the adaptation of 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> and his other poems to this ephemeral form of print culture 
                    (<persName corresp="#AMH">Adele Holcomb</persName> asserts that he commissioned the pocket&#x2010;book vignettes 
                    [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HOLCOMBCLASSICALTURNER">&#x201C;Neglected Classical Phase of Turner&#x02BC;s Art&#x201D;</ref>, 406]). 
                    Later, in <date when="1834">1834</date>, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> admitted that his publisher, <persName corresp="#EM">Moxon</persName>, 
                    had not asked his permission to issue the <date when="1830">1830</date> illustrated <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> and the 
                    <date when="1834">1834</date> <title type="book" corresp="#ROGERSPOEMS1834"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> 
                    in four&#x2010;shilling monthly parts, so that consumers of modest means could afford to acquire these elegant books 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MERRIAMMOXON">Merriam, <hi rend="italic">Edward Moxon</hi></ref>, 45).</p> 
                <p>The convergence in period and style of the pocket books and the annuals suggests how elements of print culture in itself helped to staged the success 
                    of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s illustrated poems in the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>. 
                    Fashionable pocket books flourished from the <date notBefore="1770" notAfter="1799">final three decades of the eighteenth century</date> through the 
                    <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1850">first half of the nineteenth century</date>, with such features as small engraved illustrations and almanac tables likewise offered 
                    by the early <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">illustrated literary annuals</ref>, which emerged in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>. 
                    <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName> probably commenced designing vignettes for the book&#x2010;length illustrated 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> as early as <date when="1826">1826</date>, 
                    only one year after the appearance of the pocket&#x2010;book version of the poem with its small vignettes by <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POWELLTURNERSVIGNETTES">Powell, &#x201C;Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes&#x201D;</ref>, 3). 
                    Yet the <date when="1825">1825</date> <title type="periodical" corresp="#ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</hi></title>, which proved to be the last&#x2010;produced 
                    of this long&#x2010;running pocket book, presents two significant differences compared to earlier issues, which suggest a greater authorial presence: 
                    <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName> substituted architectural scenes for his usual figure illustrations, a subject more like <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s; 
                    and <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s text was placed more on a par with the illustrations, rather than serving merely as a prompt for the pictures. 
                    Whereas earlier layouts reduced the literary source to a series of brief captions to the pictures, the <date when="1825">1825</date> issue 
                    presented a facing&#x2010;page spread, with the verso embellished by an architectural vignette, and the facing recto (formerly blank, in earlier issues) presenting a text box 
                    containing a substantial verse extract, as compared with the mere captions incorporated into the illustrations for earlier issues 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JUNGILLUSTRATED">Jung, &#x201C;The Illustrated Pocket Diary&#x201D;</ref>, 31).</p>
                <p>In the full integrity of its text, <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> became a best&#x2010;seller when 
                    <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s commissioned <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="turner_j_m_w_note.php">J. M. W. Turner (1775&#x2013;1851)</ref>,

                    The partnership was a boon for the young <persName corresp="#EM">Moxon</persName> (<date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1858">1801&#x2013;58</date>), whom 
                    <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> had recently set up in business, while <persName corresp="#TCP">Thomas Cadell</persName> 
                    (<date notBefore="1773" notAfter="1836">1773&#x2013;1836</date>) was a well established publisher. In <persName corresp="#EM">Moxon</persName>, 
                    <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> found an idealistic champion of poetry publication, at a time when the genre seemed all but universally pronounced unmarketable 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MERRIAMMOXON">Merriam, <hi rend="italic">Edward Moxon</hi></ref>, 17&#x2013;18, 23&#x2013;24, 29). 
                    In <persName corresp="#TCP">Cadell</persName>, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> could rely on the experience of a publisher who for decades had successfully produced 
                    illustrated books for both modest and upper&#x2010;class consumers, and who was a longtime employer of <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName> as an illustrator 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BENNETTSTOTHARD">Bennett, <hi rend="italic">Thomas Stothard</hi></ref>, 15). While no poet other 
                    than <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> could have borne the prohibitive publication expenses, the edition had recouped his investment by the 
                    <date notBefore="1832-03-20" notAfter="1832-06-21">spring of 1832</date>, when one of the nearly 7,000 copies thus far sold would have been inscribed for

                    is accurate about the story of this first encounter with <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>

                <p>So the well&#x2010;known story goes, although <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself expresses uncertainty in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> 
                    whether he received the book for his <date when="1832">1832</date> or <date when="1833">1833</date> birthday. Even more surprisingly, 
                    as <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s accounts show, a copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>

                    This may have been an additional copy, however. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s birthday copy is said to have been a present from

                    although the copy is not signed by him.</p>
                <p>While capitalizing on recent print technologies&#x2014;and perhaps governed by changing economy for poetry&#x2014;the innovations marking <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    <date when="1830">1830</date> <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> lay in its techniques for preserving rather old&#x2010;fashioned

                    In that edition, poems were decorated with headpiece and tailpiece engravings by <persName corresp="#TBENGRAVER">Thomas Bewick</persName> 
                    (<date notBefore="1753" notAfter="1828">1753&#x2013;1828</date>) and <persName corresp="#JBE">John Bewick</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1760" notAfter="1795">1760&#x2013;95</date>). 
                    In the illustrated <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, the headpieces typically feature <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s landscapes, 
                    and the tailpieces illustrate narrative episodes with <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>&#x02BC;s figures. The effect could not be achieved using the older technologies 
                    employed by the Bewicks, however, since they engraved in wood, producing relief blocks that could be set along with the type, whereas steel engraving was an intaglio process. 
                    To achieve the neoclassical design using updated technology, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s printers devised a method for passing sheets through the press twice, 
                    once for caputuring the intaglio engraving, and once again for taking impressions from the relief type. The intaglio impression was taken first, 
                    and in such a way that the plate registration mark would be cut away with the trimmed pages

                <p><persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> exercised authoritarian control over the design and execution of every illustration, just as he obsessively revised almost every poem 
                    for the new edition (and persisted in developing <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> and other works for future editions of his poetry). 
                    <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> decided on the subjects of the illustrations and their treatment, and he demanded subtle alterations in their execution, 
                    even if the laborious steel engraving was already underway. The artists and engravers were compliant, with <persName corresp="JMWT">Turner</persName> relinquishing his dramatic instincts 
                    for the sake of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s neoclassicism, and allowing <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>&#x02BC;s figures to be placed in his landscapes, 
                    and with the untempermental <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName> ready to agree to almost anything

                    Even the printer may not have escaped <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s supervision, since was known at times to descend on printshops, where he 
                    &#x201C;stirred up everybody with a long stick&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MERRIAMMOXON">Merriam, <hi rend="italic">Edward Moxon</hi></ref>, 28 n. 15). 
                    As critics have also remarked, however, if <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> was exacting in his demands, he and his collaborators were sympathetically well matched in their approach to the subject. 
                    <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>&#x02BC;s cheery representation of childhood and his idealized view of feminine grace clearly appealed to <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s taste 
                    as a collector and a writer (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BENNETTSTOTHARD">Bennett, <hi rend="italic">Thomas Stothard</hi></ref>, 31&#x2013;35); 
                    and <persName corresp="JMWT">Turner</persName>, while sharing <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s reverence for the antiquity of <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>, 
                    shrewdly offset his patron&#x02BC;s tendency to mire his poetry in historical pedantry, and instead complemented the poems with topographical interest that the poet neglected 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POWELLTURNERSOUTH">Powell, <hi rend="italic">Turner in the South</hi></ref>, 132&#x2013;34;

                <p>The result is a happy collaboration of writer and artists that both embodies the technological advances and the changing literary markets of the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</date>, 
                    while also defying the odds presented by those markets with an outstanding success. The <date when="1830">1830</date> <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> 
                    seems to pass judgment on the technologies that it exploits, as compared with the gaudy shallowness of the book&#x02BC;s cousins, the steel&#x2010;engraved 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliograhical" target="annuals_note.php">annuals</ref>. Its typography referenced the beautiful typeface used for the 
                    <orgName corresp="#SHAKSPEAREPRESS">Shakspeare Press</orgName> edition of <persName corresp="#OG">Goldsmith</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#TPPOET">Parnell</persName>&#x02BC;s poems,

                    Its engraving, worthy of the Bewicks&#x02BC; skill, was undertaken by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="goodall_edward_note.php">Edward Goodall (<date notBefore="1795" notAfter="1870">1795&#x2013;1870</date>)</ref>,

                    In <date when="1834">1834</date>, the success was repeated with a collected edition of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s

                    after <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName> and <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>. Sadly, <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>

                <p>By <date when="1847">1847</date>, shortly before revolutions on the Continent must have made <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s Grand Tour poem seem quaintly dated,

                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POWELLTURNERSOUTH">Powell, <hi rend="italic">Turner in the South</hi></ref>, 136). 
                    According to <persName corresp="#JRH">J. R. Hale</persName>, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> considered the <date when="1834">1834</date> edition 
                    of <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> to be the &#x201C;first complete&#x201D; version of the work

                    however, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> appears to have continued to oversee editions of his poems, adding notes and possibly making further small refinements to the poems. 
                    <persName corresp="#JRH">Hale</persName> identifies editions of <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> published in

                <p>The bibliography of these later editions remains to be exhaustively described, and versions of all of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s poems require collating. 
                    (The identity of the &#x201C;complete&#x201D; <date when="1834">1834</date> edition&#x201D; of <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> is elusive. 
                    The illustrated poem continued to be bound separately from the <date when="1834">1834</date> <title type="book" corresp="#ROGERSPOEMS1834"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title>. 
                    In a two&#x2010;volume edition of the paired works held by the <orgName corresp="#UCLAL">library of the University of California, Los Angeles</orgName>, the volume of 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> carries a title page with the <date when="1835">1835</date>. 
                    Its contents appears identical to that of the <date when="1830">1830</date> edition, whatever variants might be discoverable in the individual poems and prose pieces.)
