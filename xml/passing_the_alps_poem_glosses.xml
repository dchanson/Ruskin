                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> models this arrangement on <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="rogers_samuel_note.php">Samuel Rogers (<date notBefore="1763" notAfter="1855">1763&#x2013;1855</date>)</ref>, 
                    in which a poem about the western Alpine pass, &#x201C;The Great St. Bernard,&#x201D; gives way to &#x201C;The Descent,&#x201D; 
                    followed by &#x201C;The Alps.&#x201D; In the latter poem, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s speaker retraces imaginatively the entire span of the crossing, 
                    preparing for his celebration of arrival in the following poems about <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>. 
                    (Also, between &#x201C;The Descent&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Alps,&#x201D; <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> pauses to relate two verse tales: &#x201C;Jorasse,&#x201D; 
                    a highland tale about an intrepid Alpine hunter; and &#x201C;Marguerite de Tours,&#x201D; a lowland tale about a girl who crosses from <placeName corresp="MARTIGNY">Martigny</placeName>, 
                    on the Swiss side of the <geogName corresp="#STBERNARD">St. Bernard</geogName>, to the opposite <placeName corresp="#VALDAOSTA">vale of Aosta</placeName> in order to attend to her dying father. 
                    In the <date when="1839">1839</date> edition, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> added a third tale, &#x201C;The Brothers,&#x201D; about twin brothers who lose their infant brother to an eagle.)<lb/>
                    
                    In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php">plan</ref> for the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; 
                    he makes <ref type="witness" target="passing_the_alps_poem_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</ref> serve the structural function of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    &#x201C;The Alps&#x201D; as a summary reflection on the experience of crossing. Both poems use a trope of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> as a &#x201C;barrier&#x201D; between civilizations, 
                    a trope developed by a historical reference to <persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName> as the sublime analogy for struggling against that barrier 
                    (<persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName>&#x02BC;s crossing is also the subject of <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s vignette for &#x201C;The Alps&#x201D; 
                    in the <date when="1830">1830</date> illustrated <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>). Thus, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> captures <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    idea of one poem serving as an epitome of the experience of crossing that is elaborated&#x2014;topographically, historically, anecdotally&#x2014;in surrounding poems.<lb/>
                    
                    There are also differences between <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    and <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s crossing poems. In <ref type="witness" target="passing_the_alps_poem_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</ref>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                    develops the vision of <persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName>&#x02BC;s invasion as its sole topic, 
                    whereas in &#x201C;The Alps&#x201D; <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> characteristically contrasts the turbulent past with his speaker&#x02BC;s present 
                    &#x201C;path of pleasure&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROGERSITALY1830">Rogers, <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> [1830]</ref>, 30). 
                    Also, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, according to his <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php">plan</ref>, 
                    intended to situate <ref type="witness" target="passing_the_alps_poem_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</ref> 
                    at the head of a cluster of poems about the mountain pass, unlike <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> who posed &#x201C;The Alps&#x201D; as a retrospection past the watershed. 
                    Despite these differences, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> clearly adopted structural cues from <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s sequence of poems.<lb/>
                    
                    According to this interpretation, <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> violated <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s structural intentions. 
                    As the first editor to reconstruct the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; by appending draft to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX fair copy</ref>, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> erred 
                    by placing &#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D; between <ref type="witness" target="genoa_poem_1891.php">&#x201C;Genoa&#x201D;</ref> 
                    and <ref type="witness" target="chamouni_poem_msvii.php">&#x201C;Chamouni&#x201D;</ref>, causing <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem 
                    to function as a transition between <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName>, 
                    rather than between <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>. The latter arrangement appears to have been in 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s mind as early as the <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g2.php">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</ref> sequence, 
                    which pairs <ref type="witness" target="passing_the_alps_poem_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</ref> with 
                    <ref type="witness" target="milan_cathedral_poem_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Milan Cathedral&#x201D;</ref>.<lb/>
                    
                    In another view, however, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s erroneous placement of &#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D; was inspired, 
                    for while he disrupted <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s elaboration of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s model, 
                    the editor used available materials to patch together an approximation of how <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cluster of poems 
                    about the north crossing would eventually have been mirrored by a cluster about the western crossing. According to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php">plan</ref>, the <geogName corresp="#SPLUGEN">Spl&#x00FC;gen</geogName> cluster, extending from 
                    <ref type="witness" target="passing_the_alps_poem_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</ref> through 
                    <ref type="witness" target="the_descent_poem_msviii.php">&#x201C;The Descent&#x201D;</ref> and poems on the Italian lakes, 
                    would have been mirrored in reverse by a cluster including &#x201C;The Ascent&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Grand St. Bernard,&#x201D; leading to &#x201C;The Lake of Geneva&#x201D;&#x2014;and 
                    doubtless this cluster, too, would have exploited <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s tropes about crossings. Thus, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    solution reveals another way in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> abandoned &#x201C;The Account&#x201D; only when he had effectively completed his apprenticeship to his models 
                    (see <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent.php#SOURCES">Account of a Tour on the Continent: Discussion&#x2014;Sources</ref>). 
                    Moreover, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;misplacement&#x201D; allows <ref type="witness" target="passing_the_alps_poem_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</ref> 
                    to stand in for &#x201C;The Grand St. Bernard,&#x201D; which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> never composed, by associating the reference to 
                    <persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName>&#x02BC;s crossing with a western passage where the event belongs historically.</note>
