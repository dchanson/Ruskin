                <l>He has worn a prisoned way </l>
                <l>&#x02BC;Neath the round hills&#x02BC; bending sway. </l>

                <l>On their old, straight branches mossed and grey, </l>
                <l>And the foam drove down on the water&#x02BC;s hue </l>

                <l>And a wreath of mist curled faint and far, </l>
