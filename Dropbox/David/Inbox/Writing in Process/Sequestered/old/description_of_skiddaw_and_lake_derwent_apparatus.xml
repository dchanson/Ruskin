                    <p>In his 10 May 1829 letter presenting the poem for his father&#x02BC;s birthday, 
                        Ruskin says: &#x201C;I think I began it about three months ago&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 200)--that is, counting backwards from this letter, 
                        late February or early March (at the latest). This date corresponds convincingly to the draft poem's position in 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title></ref>, following

                    <p>Some revision of the poem for publication must have taken place between May and August 1829, 
                        when <title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines Written at the Lakes in Cumberland. &#x007C; <hi rend="italic">Derwentwater</hi>&#x201D;</title> was published; 
                        and further revision on the remainder of the poem could have taken place up until February 1830, 
                        when <title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINONSKIDDAWANDDERWENT1830">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent-Water&#x201D;</title> was published.</p>

                            <title corresp="#RUSKINSKIDDAWANDDERWENT">&#x201C;description of skiddaw &#x0026; lake derwent&#x201D;</title>, 
                            was likely &#x201C;that blank verse upon Lake Derwent&#x201D; that Ruskin &#x201C;demurred at bringing&#x201D; to his father, as he recalled in a 10 May 1829 letter 
                            (not a posted letter, by any external evidence, but a cover letter inscribed on the outside, in Ruskin's hand, as &#x201C;Birthday Odes &#x007C; To my dear Papa"). 
                            On that occasion, Ruskin temporized because the poem &#x201C;was designed for your birthday and I did not wish you to see it beforehand.&#x201D; 
                            There was even &#x201C;a line saying something about this happy day and I was afraid you would ask me what happy day and then the whole secret would 
                            gradually have been hauled out of my unwilling mouth&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 199). 
                            The evasive maneuveur that Ruskin was recalling may have been occurred about April 1829, when a gap in the surviving family letters possibly indicates that 
                            John James was at home.</p>
                        <p>Such a line about a &#x201C;happy day&#x201D; is contained in the draft, <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title></ref>, 
                            at the end of first section, which describes Skiddaw (&#x201C;. . . but no more <del type="strikethrough">on</del><!-- CHECK --> / on this sad subject on this happy day&#x201D;). 
                            The line recurs in the fair-copy version, <title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATERMSV">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D;</title>, 
                            which is found in <ref type="apparatus" target="battle_of_waterloo_ms_apparatus"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#BATTLEOFWATERLOOMS">&#x201C;Battle of Waterloo, A Play, in Two Acts, with Other Small Poems, Dedicated to His Father&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                            On the occasion prior to John James's birthday, to which Ruskin refers, he apparently copied or recited a version that is not represented by extant copies, 
                            since Ruskin writes that he &#x201C;found a way of evading this line as I found that when it was missed the poem sounded quite well without it&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 200).</p>
                        <p>As Van Akin Burd remarks, &#x201C;the poem 'Derwentwater,' which was apparently sent to [John James] as an enclosure with [Ruskin's 10 May 1829] letter is no longer with it&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 200 n. 2). 
                            However, since Ruskin inscribed the letter as &#x201C;Birthday Odes&#x201D;--using the plural--the presentation copy may not have been devoted solely to the 
                            topographical poem. Rather, the enclosure may have been the handmade booklet, 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="battle_of_waterloo_ms_apparatus"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#BATTLEOFWATERLOOMS">&#x201C;Battle of Waterloo, A Play, in Two Acts, with Other Small Poems, Dedicated to His Father&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                            which contains the only surviving fair copy in Ruskin's hand. The description of the enclosure in Ruskin's letter matches this booklet more convincingly 
                            if one omits Burd&#x02BC;s bracketed editorial insertion: &#x201C;On Newyearsday I prepared a small poem for you,&#x201D; 
                            and therefore &#x201C;on your birthday it becomes me to have a much larger [one] for you&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 199). That is, by a &#x201C;larger,&#x201D; 
                            Ruskin may have meant, not just a single larger poem, but a larger project--the handmade booklet, which he dated 1829, and which contains 
                            along with the poem several other poems and a play. The pamphlet also precisely meets the inscription on the letter, &#x201C;Birthday Odes,&#x201D; 
                            since it includes a fair copy of another 1829 birthday poem, <ref type="apparatus" target="may_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#MAY">&#x201C;May&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                            Despite all this, one cannot discount the possibility that Ruskin's 10 May 1829 letter once accompanied a fair-copy version of the topographical poem, 
                            presently unknown, which perhaps was paired with the second 1829 birthday ode, <title type="poem" corresp="#MAY">&#x201C;May&#x201D;</title>.</p>

                        <p>Ruskin's original poem was revised and split into two poems for publication in the

                            Thus, Ruskin's first poem to appear in print, and his first publication of any kind, was

                            The responsibility and authority for the splitting and revision of the poem are unknown. As the editors of the Library Edition speculate, 
                            the revision presumably was guided either by the magazine's editor, 
                            the <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="andrews_edward_note.php">Reverend Edward Andrews (1787&#x2013;1841)</ref>, 
                            or by Ruskin's father, John James Ruskin, or by both of them. Subsequent scholars have weighted the responsibility on the father's side 
                            (see, e.g., <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MAIDMENTONLYPRINT">Maidment, &#x201C;&#x2018;Only Print&#x2019;&#x201D;</ref>, 196), 
                            but in fact no evidence survives to document the process of revision.</p>
                        <p>Another mystery lies in the fact of the first publication repeatedly dropping out of view. 
                            Sometime in the late 1840s, John James Ruskin compiled a <ref type="apparatus" target="jjr_poetry_list_msiv_apparatus.php">List of Published Poems, 1830-46</ref> 
                            in blank pages remaining in <ref type="apparatus" target="msiv_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIV">MS IV</title></ref>, 
                            one of Ruskin's Red Books. The list, which John James presumably made in preparation for collecting his son's verse in the Poems by J.R. (1850), 
                            begins with the entry, &#x201C;on Skiddaw &#x0026; Derwent Water | page 72 Spiritual Times | Feby 1830 age 11 years,&#x201D; 
                            omitting mention of the earlier <title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines&#x201D;</title> published in the August 1829 issue of the magazine. 
                            In the Poems (1891), W. G. Collingwood noted John James's listing of the 1830 poem in MS IV, but he ignored the clue in his editing even of the 1830 poem, 
                            basing his copytext on Ruskin's draft manuscript rather than on either of the printed versions. 
                            The recovery of the text of the printed poems--both <title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines&#x201D;</title>, and 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINONSKIDDAWANDDERWENT1830">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent-Water&#x201D;</title>--should be credited to the journalist and book collector, 
                            H. Robertson Nicoll (1851-1923), who in June 1895 published an article, 
                            <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#NICOLLFIRSTPUBLISHEDWRITINGS">&#x201C;First Published Writings of Mr. Ruskin&#x201D;</ref>, 
                            in a journal that he founded and edited, the <title type="periodical" corresp="#BOOKMAN"><hi rend="italic">Bookman</hi></title>. 
                            Yet no mention of this discovery was made by the editors of the editors of the Library Edition, 
                            who printed <title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINONSKIDDAWANDDERWENT1830">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent-Water&#x201D;</title> based on copytext from the February 1830 
                            <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES">Spiritual Times</title>, heralding this version as &#x201C;the earliest printed work of Ruskin,&#x201D; 
                            while perpetuating the seemingly fatalistic neglect of the <title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines&#x201D;</title>. 
                            The complete facts about Ruskin's first publication had to be rediscovered by James S. Dearden, who corrected the record in a brief article, 
                            <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RUSKINFIRSTPUB">&#x201C;John Ruskin&#x02BC;s First Published Work&#x201D;</ref>, 
                            published independently and almost exactly a century following the appearance of Nicoll's 1895 article.</p>
                        <p>
                            a short-lived periodical edited by Ruskin's tutor, 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="andrews_edward_note.php">Edward Andrews (1787&#x2013;1841)</ref>. 
                            First, the concluding portion of the original poem was revised and published in the August 1829 issue as 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines Written at the Lakes in Cumberland. &#x007C; <hi rend="italic">Derwentwater</hi>&#x201D;</title>. 
                            An explanation for the decision to concentrate on only these few lines may lie in the shortness of time available to the editor, 
                            from May 1829, when he is likely to have first read Ruskin's original poem, and August 1829, 
                            when the &#x201C;Lines&#x201D; appeared in print (see <ref type="internal" target="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</ref>). Only a few months were available 
                            for revision of Ruskin's concluding lines, and for delivery of a brief but polished poem to the printer in time for the magazine's release in August.</p>
                        <p>A more leisurely space of time allowed for revision of the main body of Ruskin's poem and its publication in 
                            February 1830 as <title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINONSKIDDAWANDDERWENT1830">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent-Water&#x201D;</title>. 
                             
                            </p>
                        <p>Whoever was responsible, the <title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines&#x201D;</title> was formed by isolating 
                            the third strophe of the original poem, which in the <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title></ref> 
                            draft was designated by Ruskin as the &#x201C;conclusion,&#x201D; beginning &#x201C;sweet derwent on thy winding shore.&#x201D; 
                            (In the fair copy, contained in <ref type="apparatus" target="battle_of_waterloo_ms_apparatus"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#BATTLEOFWATERLOOMS">&#x201C;Battle of Waterloo, A Play, in Two Acts, with Other Small Poems, Dedicated to His Father&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                            this concluding section is not subtitled, but it is marked by a horizontal bar above &#x201C;Sweet Derwent on thy winding shore.&#x201D;) 
                            In addition, a number of significant revisions were made to the now separated parts of the poem. Most obviously, 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines&#x201D;</title> concludes with a moralizing couplet, which does not appear in the original; 
                            and decorous revisions transform the conclusion of <title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINONSKIDDAWANDDERWENT1830">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent-Water&#x201D;</title>, as well.</p>
                        <p>The pious sentiment in these revisions may be viewed as alien to the original secular topographical poem, as found in the surviving 1829 draft and fair copy. 
                            The process of revision to bring about this change may be reflected in a debate over the respective claims of worldly beauty and religious austerity, 
                            which appears to be underway in fragments that, in MS II, occur amid draft of &#x201C;Eudosia&#x201D;--<ref type="apparatus" target="these_worldly_things_are_fair_and_beauteous_too_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINTHESEWORLDLYTHINGS">&#x201C;These worldly things are fair and beauteous too&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                            and <ref type="apparatus" target="we_say_that_this_world_is_unhappy_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINWESAYTHATTHISWORLD">&#x201C;We say that this world is unhappy&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                            The debate--if debate it is, and not two statements in a related apologia for this-worldly beauty--seems to culminate in MS II with another fragment, 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="if_such_the_beauties_of_an_earthly_shore_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINIFSUCHTHEBEAUTIES">&#x201C;If such the beauties of an earthly shore&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                            which is an almost illegible, scrawled draft that may represent Ruskin&#x02BC;s attempts at revising the concluding portion of the poem on Skiddaw and Derwent for publication. 
                            If these fragments represent that revision process, they must date between 10 May 1829, when Ruskin wrote his letter presenting some form of the poem to his father, 
                            and August 1829 when &#x201C;Lines&#x201D; was published--not the year and more since 1828, when Collingwood believed that Ruskin first composed his topographical poem. 
                            Further revision on the remaining body of the poem could have taken place up until February 1830, 
                            when <title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINONSKIDDAWANDDERWENT1830">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent-Water&#x201D;</title> was published.</p>
                       <p><persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> edited the poem using the 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title></ref> draft version as copytext

                            Apparently, by 1891 Collingwood had not seen the booklet, 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="battle_of_waterloo_ms_apparatus"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#BATTLEOFWATERLOOMS">&#x201C;Battle of Waterloo, A Play, in Two Acts, with Other Small Poems, Dedicated to His Father&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                           containing the fair copy, although he made up for the oversight in 1893 and mentioned both the &#x201C;Waterloo&#x201D; booklet and the poem in 
                            <ref type="bibliography" target="#WGCLIFEOFJR1893"><hi rend="italic">Life and Work of John Ruskin</hi></ref> (1:37-38). 
                           Had Collingwood been aware of the fair-copy version in the &#x201C;Waterloo&#x201D; booklet, he surely would not have troubled to &#x201C;decipher&#x201D; his copytext 
                           from the &#x201C;childish and almost illegible scribble&#x201D; in <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title></ref>

                        <p><persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> did not lack knowledge of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES">Spiritual Times</title> 
                            printed version of the poem. In his &#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems,&#x201D; Collingwood noted that 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msiv_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIV">MS IV</title></ref> contains the

                            and he quotes the first entry in the list: &#x201C;on Skiddaw &#x0026; Derwent Water / page 72 Spiritual Times / Feby 1830 age 11 years&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>, 1:262;

                            Presumably, the scarce periodical was unavailable to Collingwood or even traceable; and unable to document the reference, he ignored the implication. 
                            Two years later, in his 1893 biography of Ruskin, Collingwood persisted in identifying Ruskin's first publication as the March 1834 prose piece, 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="enquiries_on_the_causes_of_the_colour_of_the_water_of_the_rhine_apparatus.php"><title type="essay" corresp="#RUSKINENQUIRIES">&#x201C;Enquiries on the Causes of the Colour of the Water of the Rhine&#x201D;</title></ref> 
                            for the <title type="periodical" corresp="#MAGAZINEOFNATURALHISTORY">Magazine of Natural History</title>; 
                            and he stood by that account in the 1900 revised edition of the biography 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="#WGCLIFEOFJR1893">Collingwood, <hi rend="italic">Life and Work of John Ruskin</hi></ref>, 1:57, and see vol. 1, app., p. iv;

                        <p>Even if Collingwood had followed up on the clue in John James's <ref type="apparatus" target="jjr_poetry_list_msiv_apparatus.php">List of Published Poems, 1830-46</ref>, 
                            he might not have been led to the August 1829 printing of <title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines Written at the Lakes in Cumberland. &#x007C; <hi rend="italic">Derwentwater</hi>&#x201D;</title>, since, 
                            surprisingly, John James does not mention it. Instead, whereas Collingwood, like the Reverend Andrews, divides the poem into two parts, 
                            the later editor did not observe the same division or use the titles as published in 
                            <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES">Spiritual Times</title>. Rather, Collingwood was prompted to his division of the poem 
                            in part by an accidental feature of the MS II draft, in which the section that he separated out and entitled &#x201C;Skiddaw&#x201D; happens to be followed sequentially by the prose fragment, 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="sermon_notes_christs_intercession_apparatus.php"><title type="sermon" corresp="#SERMONNOTESCHRISTS">Sermon Notes ["christs intercession"]</title></ref>. 
                            In MS II, where the poem's draft resumes immediately following these sermon notes, there is no indication that Ruskin intended a separate poem called, 
                            as Collingwood entitles it, &#x201C;Derwentwater.&#x201D; The draft following the sermon notes begins &#x201C;skiddaw derwent water / Now derwent water come a looking glass&#x201D;--a 
                            transition of a like kind with one in the draft prior to the sermon notes, which Collingwood omitted from his
                            printing of &#x201C;Skiddaw&#x201D;: &#x201C;But enough / Ive treated of the clouds. now skiddaw come&#x201D; (falling in lines 14-15, as printed in PJR, 1:11).</p>
                        <p>One silent omission in Collingwood's version comprises the penultimate half-line and the concluding line that referred to John James's birthday, 
                            a decision presumably in keeping with the policy that &#x201C;Birthday Addresses usually need lopping to be presentable as &#x2018;poems&#x2019;&#x201D;

                            nor did they acknowledge any awareness that this earlier publication existed in the August 1829 
                            <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES">Spiritual Times</title>. Curiously, Cook and Wedderburn had even less excuse in overlooking the earlier publication than did Collingwood 
                            in neglecting the 1830 <title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINONSKIDDAWANDDERWENT1830">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent-Water&#x201D;</title>, 
                            since the <title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines&#x201D;</title>, 
                            which is truly &#x201C;the earliest printed work of Ruskin,&#x201D; had already been discovered by the journalist and book collector, H. Robertson Nicoll (1851-1923). 
                            In June 1895, Nicoll published an article, <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#NICOLLFIRSTPUBLISHEDWRITINGS">&#x201C;First Published Writings of Mr. Ruskin&#x201D;</ref>, 
                            in a journal that he founded and edited, the <title type="periodical" corresp="#BOOKMAN"><hi rend="italic">Bookman</hi></title>, 
                            in which he discussed the <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES">Spiritual Times</title>, and he reprinted the 1829 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines&#x201D;</title> along with the 1830 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINONSKIDDAWANDDERWENT1830">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent-Water&#x201D;</title>. 
                            The neglect of Nicoll's discovery, or at least of the entirety of his discovery, led to the complete facts about Ruskin's first publication having to be rediscovered 
                            and published independently by James S. Dearden almost exactly a century after the appearance of Nicoll's article 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RUSKINFIRSTPUB">Dearden, &#x201C;John Ruskin&#x02BC;s First Published Work&#x201D;</ref>).</p>
                        <p>Cook and Wedderburn do not cite Nicoll's article anywhere in the Library Edition, although they quote from another article by him on Ruskin 
                            that was published in the same journal (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 38:381). 
                            Since both Cook and Wedderburn's bibliographical note (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 2:265 n.1) 
                            and Nicoll's article contain details about the <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES">Spiritual Times</title> that are lacking in the other, 
                            it is possible that the two investigations were independent--or perhaps that Cook and Wedderburn, learning about Nicoll's discovery, but neglecting to track down his article, 
                            consulted a copy of <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES">Spiritual Times</title> on their own, albeit imperfectly. 
                            On Nicoll's part, it seems equally ungrateful that his article neglects to cite Collingwood's &#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems,&#x201D; 
                            for apart from Collingwood's quotation from John James's #

                            <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES">Spiritual Times</title>? Whatever the editors' exchange or lack of one, it was apparently Nicoll 
                            who made the connection between the elusive magazine and Edward Andrews, the link that enabled him to find Ruskin's poems by seeking the help of the Andrews family: 
                            &#x201C;I have before me a volume containing ten numbers, all that were published, of the <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES">Spiritual Times</title>. . . . 
                            The editor was the Rev. Dr. Andrews, minister of Beresford Chapel, Walworth, one of the most distinguished dissenting ministers of his time. . . . The distinction 
                            of the periodical is that it contains the first published writings of Mr. Ruskin. Mr Ruskin, it will be remembered [from Praeterita], was at one time a pupil of Dr. Andrews, 
                            and was occasionally present in his chapel, where he remembers seeing Dr. Andrews's daughter [Emily Andrews, 1824-62], afterwards Mrs. Conventry Patmore. 
                            Through the kindness of Dr. Andrews's granddaughter, [the social activist] Miss Eliza Orme [1848-1937], I have been able to identify Mr. Ruskin's contributions&#x201D;

                        a widely disseminated and broadly popular literary and artistic annual, edited by a professional poet, 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="pringle_thomas_note.php">Thomas Pringle (1789&#x2013;1834)</ref>.

                        by a steel engraving of a vedute of the city drawn by a professional, albeit not a well known artist. 
                        Prior to these poems' publication, Ruskin's father took the auspicious step of consulting with a nationally celebrated author, 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="hogg_james_note.php">James Hogg (ca. 1770&#x2013;1835)</ref>, 
                        about the probability of the youth's future success as a poet; and the editor, Pringle, squired the young Ruskin on a state visit to the doyen 
                        of London literary culture, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="rogers_samuel_note.php">Samuel Rogers (1763&#x2013;1855)</ref>. 
                        The occasion was carefully planned to bring Ruskin forward as the author who signed himself &#x201C;J.R.,&#x201D; whereas Ruskin's previous appearance in the 
                        <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES">Spiritual Times</title>, while doubtless a source of great pride to the family, 
                        was not accompanied by such gravity and deliberation.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, the two occasions share the characteristic of being petted and wheedled into realization by family and friends. 
                        In 1834, the Ruskins had already gained a footing inside the publishing house responsible for 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title></ref>, 
                        <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>, which employed Ruskin's cousin,

                        and even John James's appeal for professional advice from <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="hogg_james_note.php">Hogg</ref> 
                        was ventured on the strength of a personal connection--the Ettrick Shepherd's visit to Herne Hill two years earlier, an introduction probably arranged by Pringle. 
                        Underpinning these connections were the bonds uniting Scottish professionals who had come south to make their fortunes in the metropolis. 
                        In 1829, the personal connection leading to publication in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES">Spiritual Times</title> 
                        was that the monthly magazine was edited by the <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="andrews_edward_note.php">Reverend Edward Andrews (1787&#x2013;1841)</ref>, 
                        Ruskin&#x02BC;s tutor, and the family's clergyman at the Congregational chapel in Walworth.</p>
                    <p>The Ruskins engaged Andrews to tutor Ruskin starting in April 1829, only about five months prior to the publication of 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines Written at the Lakes in Cumberland&#x201D;</title>, in August 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 200); 
                        and presumably Andrews would not have seen Ruskin's original poem prior to its presentation to John James on his 10 May birthday. 
                        Only a few months elapsed, therefore, between when Andrews likely first read the poem and when he oversaw its revision and printing. 
                        Thus, the shortness of time may account for the decision to isolate only the conclusion of the poem and present it as &#x201C;Lines.&#x201D; 
                        appears, published his own children&#x02BC;s verse in the journal<hi rend="italic">Coventry Patmore&#x02BC;s Angel</hi>, and so it was
                        natural enough that he would edit verse by his precocious new student.
                        (Reciprocally, John James would later copy verse by Andrews&#x02BC;s daughter Eliza
                        in Ruskin&#x02BC;s MS VI [see part 1, MS VI, e].) In retrospect, then, it was
                        auspicious that, in Ruskin&#x02BC;s May 10 birthday letter to his father
                        accompanying the MS V &#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water,&#x201D; he devoted a quarter
                        of the space celebrating the recent &#x201C;coming of the tutor&#x201D;--&#x201C;a most important
                        aera of my life&#x201D; (RFL, 200). Worshiping Andrews&#x02BC;s mirthful yet learned
                        character, Ruskin must have been ecstatic to be published in his tutor&#x02BC;s
                        magazine, whatever he may have felt about the revisions demanded of his
                        poem.</p>
                    <p>The subsequent oversight of the 1829 printing of &#x201C;Lines&#x201D; cannot be
                        attributed entirely to Cook and Wedderburn&#x02BC;s carelessness. ; see part 1, MS IV). Although John James compiled this list in the
                        later 1840s, almost two decades following the publication of &#x201C;Lines,&#x201D; it is
                        very odd that the admiring father could have forgotten even the slightest
                        detail about Ruskin&#x02BC;s first appearance in print. Surely, John James would
                        have recalled not only his own pride but also, if a now common belief can be
                        credited, his part in revising the poem for press (see B. E. Maidment,
                        &#x201C;&#x2018;Only Print&#x2019;--Ruskin and the Publishers,&#x201D; Durham University Journal 63, no.
                        3 [n.s. 32, no. 3] [June 1971]: 196). (No copies, incidentally, of either
                        the August 1829 or the February 1830 issues of the Spiritual Times are
                        presently known to have been owned by the Ruskins--the Bembridge copies, one
                        of the last additions to the collection prior to its move to Lancaster,
                        having originally belonged to Andrews--but it is beyond credibility that the
                        family did not own both issues. See RBB, 214; and James S. Dearden, &#x201C;The
                        Ruskin Galleries at Bembridge School, Isle of Wight,&#x201D; Bulletin of the John
                        Rylands Library 51, no. 2 [Spring 1969]: 334.) John James&#x02BC;s mistaken entry
                        in MS IV is crossed out in pencil, which may mean that somebody in the
                        family had spotted its inaccuracy; however, the scoring could also represent
                        John James&#x02BC;s decision, a curious one, not to include his son&#x02BC;s first two
                        publications in the 1850 Poems by &#x201C;J.R&#x201D;--not even the 1830 &#x201C;On Skiddaw and
                        Derwent-Water,&#x201D; which he certainly remembered. The omission raises
                        interesting questions that cannot be resolved in light of the available,
                        largely negative evidence, but that at least challenge prevailing
                        assumptions. Did John James, for example, in fact have a hand in revising
                        the 1829/30 poems for press--a notion, after all, that started with a mere
                        hazarded opinion by Cook and Wedderburn that &#x201C;it is possible that Ruskin&#x02BC;s
                        father or the editor touched them up for publication&#x201D; (Works, 2:265 n.)? Was
                        there, rather, something in the editing of the poems, and Andrews&#x02BC;s role in
                        their publication, that either John James or Ruskin himself disliked enough
                        to exclude them, two decades later, from the private-circulation collection?
                        In 1850, John James informed his son that &#x201C;we shall not print your 12 year
                        poems which the marvellous are better in your own printed written [i.e.,
                        hand-lettered] little Book--We shall begin with Months age 16 I believe
                        unless you desire earlier pieces&#x201D; (qtd. in &#x201C;Ruskin&#x02BC;s Poems 1850&#x201D;). This does
                        not explain why John James preferred the earlier poems to remain in their
                        presentation-copy format; and, in any case, the 1850 Poems did not begin
                        with &#x201C;The Months&#x201D; (no. 194) but with &#x201C;Song&#x201D; (no. 176), a previously
                        unpublished poem of 1833. &#x201C;Skiddaw&#x201D; and &#x201C;Lines&#x201D; could have been vetoed by
                        Ruskin owing to their trammelment in the religious and intellectual conflict
                        already mentioned. John James could have harbored some resentment of Andrews
                        as the first competition by an older male for his son&#x02BC;s affections, a
                        possible jealousy that might have fed John James&#x02BC;s and Margaret&#x02BC;s later list
                        of reasons for disapproving of the preacher and his family (see RFL 242-43,
                        366). Again, one must guard against overinterpreting negative evidence, but
                        the subsequent bibliographic history concerning Ruskin&#x02BC;s first publications
                        grows irresistibly bizarre. In a part of Deucalion issued in October 1879,
                        Ruskin confidently relayed an anecdote that transferred the event of his
                        first appearance in print to his first prose publication, his 1834 papers
                        for Loudon&#x02BC;s Magazine of Natural History (nos. 190-91, 193): I well yet
                        remember my father&#x02BC;s rushing up to the drawing-room at Herne Hill, with wet
                        and flashing eyes, with the proof in his hand of the first sentences of his
                        son&#x02BC;s writing ever set in type,--&#x201C;Inquiries on the Causes of the Colour of
                        the Water of the Rhone&#x201D; . . . . My mother and I eagerly questioning the
                        cause of his excitement,--&#x201C;It&#x02BC;s--it&#x02BC;s--only print!&#x201D; said he. Alas! how much
                        the &#x201C;only&#x201D; meant! (Works, 26:275) Ruskin may have been misled by a recent
                        bibliography of his published writings, Shepherd, of which the first edition
                        was published in September 1878, and which lists the &#x201C;Inquiries&#x201D; as Ruskin&#x02BC;s
                        first periodical publication. In October 1878, Ruskin had written to
                        Shepherd of the bibliography, &#x201C;It will be of extreme value to me in filling
                        up what gaps I can in this patched coverlid of my life before it is draped
                        over my coffin--if it may be&#x201D; (Works, 34:537). Shepherd, however, must have
                        been misled in his turn by Ruskin, who, in an 1872 edition of the Catalogue
                        of the Rudimentary Series of drawings at the Oxford schools, had remarked
                        &#x201C;that Mr. Loudon was the first literary patron who sent words of mine to be
                        actually set up in print, in his Magazine of Natural History, when I was
                        sixteen&#x201D; (Works, 21:243). The important point, I believe, is that Ruskin--in
                        the 1870s and in the context of his writings on drawing, botany, and
                        geology--wanted to believe that his first publications were scientific and
                        factual, not poetic, in nature. Since Shepherd and Ruskin&#x02BC;s published
                        remarks in the 1870s on his first publication would have been taken as
                        authoritative, the succeeding major bibliographies--Wise (1:302-3, 2:111),
                        and the chronological list of publications appended to Collingwood&#x02BC;s Life
                        (1893, 1:233)--likewise awarded the distinction to the 1834 papers for
                        Loudon&#x02BC;s Magazine. Ruskin&#x02BC;s first poetry publications, according to these
                        bibliographies, were the 1835 contributions to Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering (see
                        nos. 180, 207; Wise, 2:123; Collingwood, Life [1893], 1:233). Wise and his
                        co-editor Smart were unlikely to be disabused by Ruskin or the Severns of
                        any errors, the response from Brantwood to Wise being as politely insouciant
                        and unhelpful as Ruskin had been to Shepherd (&#x201C;Wise and Ruskin I,&#x201D; 48,
                        51-52). Collingwood, for his part, may have relied more on Wise and Smart
                        than they did on him (see &#x201C;Wise and Ruskin I,&#x201D; 46-47). Collingwood&#x02BC;s
                        persistence in the error is remarkable, however, since he knew about John
                        James&#x02BC;s entry in MS IV on the Spiritual Times publication and even printed
                        it, without comment, in 1891 (PJR 1:264; Collingwood misprinted the 1830
                        date of publication as &#x201C;1831&#x201D;). This did not prevent Collingwood two years
                        later in the Life (1893) from maintaining that Ruskin &#x201C;began his literary
                        career&#x201D; as the &#x201C;analytic John Ruskin . . . already an enfant terrible&#x201D;
                        (1:49-50). In light of what, by the 1890s, appears to have settled into a
                        prejudice favoring Ruskin&#x02BC;s analytic and scientific beginnings, Cook and
                        Wedderburn must be given credit for locating at least the 1830 Spiritual
                        Times version of &#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent-Water,&#x201D; which they used as their
                        main copytext. Still, this printing contains one-and-a-half dozen
                        punctuation variants from the original Spiritual Times version and changes
                        the wording of three lines (line 11, &#x201C;Chasing the others off&#x201D; for &#x201C;Chasing
                        each other off&#x201D; in the original; line 17, &#x201C;majestic, a giant-nature&#x02BC;s work&#x201D;
                        for &#x201C;majestic, giant-nature&#x02BC;s work&#x201D;; and line 42, &#x201C;And when he&#x02BC;s made it&#x201D;
                        for &#x201C;And when he&#x02BC;s made&#x201D;). The &#x201C;Lines&#x201D; were not, as the published title
                        claims, &#x201C;written at the lakes in Cumberland.&#x201D; Rather, as Cook and Wedderburn
                        are probably correct in suggesting about &#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water,&#x201D; the
                        poetry harkens back to the family&#x02BC;s 1826 trip to the Lakes (Works, 2:265 n.
                        1); they had also visited the district in 1824 and 1822 (TLC, 6-7). A &#x201C;great
                        tour&#x201D; to the Lakes projected for 1828 had been cancelled due to the death of
                        John James&#x02BC;s sister (see no. 25). Perhaps Ruskin believed that poetic
                        compensation for the lost tour and anticipation of next journey to the Lakes
                        (1830) would be appropriate for his father&#x02BC;s 1829 birthday. </p>

                        there&#x02BC;s no reason JJR would have recorded or cared about the
                        drafting date of the poem.] Only a few years prior to this announcement,
                        Dearden, along with Van Akin Burd, had pointed out another major error in the
                        bibliography of Ruskin&#x02BC;s so&#x2010;called first published poem,
                        the belief that &#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D; was first
                        drafted in 1828 (TLC, 7, 20 n. 20). In fact, &#x201C;description of skiddaw
                        &#x0026; lake derwent,&#x201D; as Ruskin entitled the draft and the fair
                        copy of his poem (MSS II, V), was composed between late February or early March
                        and May 1829 for his father&#x02BC;s birthday. Then, within a few
                        months&#x2014;not a few years, as always believed&#x2014;a part of
                        the &#x201C;description&#x201D; was published. That part became
                        the &#x201C;Lines Written at the Lakes in Cumberland&#x201D; in the
                        August 1829 Spiritual Times, a journal owned and edited by Ruskin&#x02BC;s
                        tutor, the Reverend Edward Andrews. In the following February, 1830, the
                        remaining portion of the original &#x201C;description&#x201D; appeared
                        as &#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water.&#x201D;</p>
