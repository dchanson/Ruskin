                    <l>SKIDDAW upon thy heights the sun shines
                        bright
                        But only for a moment then gives place
                        Unto a playful cloud which on thy brow
                        Sports wantonly then floats away in air
                        [tipped-in p. 11, opposite p. 145, no extra space]
                        Throwing its shadow on thy towering height
                        And darkening for a moment they green side [ride?]
                        But adds unto its beauty as it makes
                        The sun more bright when it again appears.
                        Then in the morning on thy brow those
                        clouds
                        Rest as upon a couch and give fair scope
                        For fancys play and airy fortresses
                        And towers battlements and all appear
                        Chasing each other off and in their turn
                        Are chased by the others. But enough
                        I=ve treated of the clouds Now Skiddaw come
                        Noble and grand and beauteous clothed with
                        green
                        And yet but scantily. And in some parts
                        A bare terrific cliff precipitate
                        Descends with only here and there a bush
                        A straggler with its roots fixed in the stone
                        And bare a scraggy as befits the soil.
                        Skiddaw majestic giant natures work
                        Lower than Alps or Andes. Pyrenee=s
                        Are all much higher But those works of art
                        Those giant works of art with thee compared
                        [@*@ above Aart@ referring to footnote: A* The Pyramids@]
                        Sink into nothing. All that art can do
                        Is nothing beside thee. The touch of man
                        [tipped-in p. 12, opposite p. 145]
                        Raised pigmy mountains but gigantic tombs
                        The touch of nature raised the mountains brow
                        But made no tombs at all save where the snow
                        The fleecy locks of winter fall around
                        And form a frail memorial for the sain
                        Who wanders far from home and meets his
                        death
                        Amidst the cold of Winter. But no more
                        On this sad subject on this happy day
                        Now Derwent Water come A looking glass
                        Wherein reflected are the mountains height
                        As in a mirror framed in rocks and woods.
                        So upon thee there is a seeming mount
                        A seeming tree a seming rivulet
                        All upon thee are painted by a hand
                        Which not a critic can well criticise
                        But to disturb thee oft bluf Eolus
                        Descends upon the mountains With his
                        breath
                        Thy polished surface is a boy at play
                        Who labours at the snow to make a man
                        And when he=s made it knocks it down
                        again
                        So when thou=st made a picture thou dost
                        play
                        [tipped-in p. 13, opposite p. 147]
                        At tearing it to pieces Trees do first
                        Tremble as if a monstrous heart of Oak
                        Were but an aspen leaf and then as if
                        It were a cobweb in the tempests blow
                        Thus like Penelope thou weavst a web
                        And then thou dost undo it. Thou=rt like her
                        Because thourt fair and oft deceiving too
                        Sweet Derwent on thy winding shore
                        Beside thy mountain forests hoar
                        There would I like to wander still
                        And drink from out the rippling rill
                        Which from thy mountain head doth fall
                        And mingles with the eagles call
                        While on Helvellyn thunder roars
                        Re-echoed by all Derwents shores
                        And where the lightning flashes still
                        Reflected in the mountain rill.
