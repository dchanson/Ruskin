                <note xml:id="ARVEATCHAMOUNITITLE" resp="#DCH"><p><hi rend="bold">Title (MS VIII; <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [<date when="1891">1891</date>]; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> [1903])&#x2014;</hi>The 
                    title which was first applied to this poem in <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [1891]</title></ref>, 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRARVEATCHAMOUNI">&#x201C;The Arve at Chamouni&#x201D;</title>, was invented by 
                    <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName>, who printed the title in square brackets to indicate his responsibility. 
                   <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> does not explain his rationale, but a persuasive case can be made for the poem's association with the prose section that immediately precedes it in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft, 
                    <title type="essay" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title>, which is likewise set at <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</placeName>. 
                    Contiguity of the two drafts in MS VIII does not in itself prove that the two texts are related: most of the adjacent 
                    texts in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> clearly do not form verse/prose pairs 
                    that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> meant to fair-copy together in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> as a topographical unit. 
                    In <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, he was drafting verse and prose as needed for his sequential progress through the fair copy (a fair copy that, at the date when he started drafting in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, 
                    had reached only so far as the end of the northern <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>/<placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName> sections and the start of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> journey), while at the same time he was ranging ahead in drafting 
                    verse and prose segments related to <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName> 
                    (see <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#COMPPUB">Account of a Tour on the Continent: Composition and Publication</ref>). 
                    Here at the outset of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft, however, he does appear to have composed a unit consisting of a prose and verse segment describing the same place, 
                    the source of the glacial tributary, the <geogName corresp="#ARVERON">Arveyron</geogName>, and its flow into the <geogName corresp="#ARVE">Arve River</geogName> in the <placeName corresp="#CHAMONIX">Chamonix valley</placeName>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Details in the poem suggestively complement features in the preceding essay, reinforcing the compositional unit. 
                    Just as the essay <title type="essay" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title> begins by describing a &#x201C;reverie&#x201D;, 
                    a &#x201C;stilly dreamy waking vision&#x201D;, the poem begins with the speaker awakening into sleep, as it were, 
                    by waking to hear a lullaby. The lullaby is sung by a river that, although unnamed in the poem, flows like the <geogName corresp="#ARVERON">Arveyron</geogName> and the <geogName corresp="#ARVE">Arve</geogName> through mountain scenery, 
                    its voice joining &#x201C;every mighty mountain stream&#x201D;. This river, however, has a &#x201C;monotonous&#x201D; sound that one would associate with a broader current, 
                    perhaps explaining why <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> connected the poem with the <geogName corresp="#ARVE">Arve</geogName> rather than the <geogName corresp="#ARVERON">Arveyron</geogName>. 
                    Another detail linking the poem with the essay is the trope of a morning sunrise, which complements the essay&#x02BC;s evening sunset&#x2014;paired tropes that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intertwines further 
                    by mentioning in the poem the &#x201C;melancholy smile / On natures features&#x201D; as evening descends.</p>
                    
                    <p>Thus, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s title, <title type="essay" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title>, which in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft appears attached exclusively 
                    to the prose essay following the title, must be intended as a section head belonging to both the following prose and verse segments. 
                    In fact, this can be the only explanation for a title appearing in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft since, by the time <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> started composing the 
                    <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> in that notebook, 
                    he had already begun the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copy in which titles pertained only to composite&#x2010;genre units of verse, prose, and illustration. Had he fair&#x2010;copied 
                    <title type="essay" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title> in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>&#x2014;and that title does appear toward the end of the 
                    <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.xml">Proposed Table of Contents for the Account of a Tour on the Continent</ref>&#x2014;he 
                    presumably would have adhered to the fair copy&#x02BC;s pattern of leading the unit with a vignette&#x2010;style illustration followed by the section title, and then by the fair&#x2010;copied poem and the prose essay.</p>
                    
                    <p><persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> errs, then, not so much in the title he gives to <title type="poem" corresp="#JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY">&#x201C;I woke to hear the lullaby&#x201D;</title>&#x2014;for 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRARVEATCHAMOUNI">&#x201C;The Arve at Chamouni&#x201D;</title> is apt enough&#x2014;as in the giving the poem any title at all. 
                    His most questionable decision lies in separating the poems from the prose in the first place, to form a version of the 
                    <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> solely in verse&#x2014;a version that, 
                    if it ever conceptually existed at all, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had abandoned after composition of the first five poems about towns in northern <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName>.</p>
                    
                    <p><persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> does use the title <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERONPOEM">&#x201C;The Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title> (he adds the article), 
                    but assigns it to another poem, which is untitled in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft, 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEFOAMGLOBES">&#x201C;The foam globes round come riding fast&#x201D;</title>. This poem falls later in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        draft of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, amid draft of the prose section for &#x201C;<placeName corresp="#HEIDELBERG">Heidelberg</placeName>&#x201D;. 
                    Unlike <title type="poem" corresp="#JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY">&#x201C;I woke to hear the lullaby&#x201D;</title>, this poem identifies its subject explicitly as the <placeName corresp="#ARVERON">Arveyron</placeName>, 
                        and presents a more obvious complement topographically to the prose description of <title type="essay" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title>. 
                        Whereas <title type="poem" corresp="#JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY">&#x201C;I woke to hear the lullaby&#x201D;</title> 
                    complements the mood of reverie in the essay, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEFOAMGLOBES">&#x201C;The foam globes round come riding fast&#x201D;</title> complements 
                        the prose description of the glacier source of the stream.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>, in which the editors reunite the poems with their complementary prose sections, 
                        <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> do recognize that the title, <title type="essay" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;The Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title>, 
                        should serve as a section title, which they apply to the prose essay as well as, taking <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x20BC;s cue, to the poem, 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEFOAMGLOBES">&#x201C;The foam globes round come riding fast&#x201D;</title> which <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> entitled 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERONPOEM">&#x201C;The Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title>

                    <p>But how did <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intend to situate these two poems vis&#x2010;&#x00E0;&#x2010;vis the essay? In the

                        he lists titles for the <placeName corresp="#CHAMONIX">Chamonix</placeName> cluster as follows. (It is unknown whether the proposed titles refer to composite sections, 
                        or to individual poems and essays, or to a combination. In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, these titles are treated as prospective composite sections.)</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>In extant manuscript, the first item corresponds to a poem and essay that could have formed a composite, the poem

                        journey to the valley, first sighting of <geogName corresp="#MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</geogName>, and the cultural mythology associated with these places. 
                        The second item corresponds to an extant poem about <persName corresp="#JBALMAT">Jacques Balmat</persName>&#x02BC;s discovery of the path to climbing the pinnacle of the mountain,

                        The next two titles in the list correspond neatly to the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> essay and poem, 
                        <title type="essay" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title> and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY">&#x201C;I woke to hear the lullaby&#x201D;</title>&#x2014;the 
                        latter fitting the description of a &#x201C;morning&#x201D; piece precisely. The final three titles do not appear to be especially represented in surviving draft, 
                        while the late&#x2010;composed <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEFOAMGLOBES">&#x201C;The foam globes round come riding fast&#x201D;</title> might conceivably have been placed 
                        at several points in this list&#x2014;perhaps most consistently with the typical composite pattern, placed as the verse prelude to the essay, <title type="essay" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title>.</p></note>
