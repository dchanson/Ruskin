                <note xml:id="ARVEATCHAMOUNITITLE" resp="#DCH">Title (MS VIII; <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [<date when="1891">1891</date>]; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> [1903])&#x2014;The 
                    title which was first applied to this poem in <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [1891]</title></ref>, 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRARVEATCHAMOUNI">&#x201C;The Arve at Chamouni&#x201D;</title>, was invented by 
                    <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName>, who printed the title in square brackets to indicate his responsibility. 
                   <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> does not explain his rationale, but a persuasive case can be made for the poem's association with the prose section that immediately precedes it in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft, 
                    <title type="essay" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title>, which is likewise set at <placeName corresp="#CHAMOUNI">Chamonix</placeName>. 
                    Contiguity of the two drafts in MS VIII does not in itself prove that the two texts are related: most of the adjacent 
                    texts in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> clearly do not form verse/prose pairs 
                    that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> meant to fair-copy together in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> as a topographical unit. 
                    In <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, he was drafting verse and prose as needed for his sequential progress through the fair copy (a fair copy that, at the date when he started drafting in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, 
                    had reached only so far as the end of the northern <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>/<placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName> sections and the start of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> journey), while at the same time he was ranging ahead in drafting 
                    verse and prose segments related to <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName> 
                    (see <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#COMPPUB">Account of a Tour on the Continent: Composition and Publication</ref>). 
                    Here at the outset of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft, however, he does appear to have composed a unit consisting of a prose and verse segment describing the same place, 
                    the source of the glacial tributary, the <geogName corresp="#ARVERON">Arveyron</geogName>, and its flow into the <geogName corresp="#ARVE">Arve River</geogName> in the <placeName corresp="#CHAMONIX">Chamonix valley</placeName>.<lb/>
                    
                    In the draft poem that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> named <title type="poem" corresp="#JRARVEATCHAMOUNI">&#x201C;The Arve at Chamouni&#x201D;</title>, 
                    the untitled <title type="poem" corresp="#JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY">"I woke to hear the lullaby"</title>, details suggestively complement features 
                    in the preceding prose section, indicating that they formed a compositional unit. 
                    Just as the essay, <title type="essay" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title>, begins by describing a &#x201C;reverie&#x201D;, 
                    a &#x201C;stilly dreamy waking vision&#x201D;, the poem begins with the speaker awakening into sleep, as it were, 
                    by waking to hear a lullaby. Moreover, the lullaby is sung by a river that, although unnamed in the poem, flows like the <geogName corresp="#ARVERON">Arveron</geogName> or <geogName corresp="#ARVE">Arve</geogName> through mountain scenery, 
                    its voice joining &#x201C;every mighty mountain stream&#x201D;. This river, however, has a &#x201C;monotonous&#x201D; sound that one would associate with a broader current, 
                    perhaps explaining why <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> connected the poem with the <geogName corresp="#ARVE">Arve</geogName> rather than the <geogName corresp="#ARVERON">Arveyron</geogName>. 
                    Finally, also linking the poem with the essay is the trope of a morning sunrise, which complements the essay&#x02BC;s evening sunset&#x2014;tropes that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intertwines further 
                    by mentioning in the poem the &#x201C;melancholy smile / On natures features&#x201D; as evening descends.<lb/>
                    
                    Thus, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s title <title type="essay" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title>, which in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft appears attached exclusively 
                    to the prose essay following the title, must be intended as a section head belonging to both the following prose and verse segments. 
                    In fact, this can be the only explanation for a title appearing the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft since, by the time <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> started composing the 
                    <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> in that notebook, 
                    he had already begun the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copy in which titles pertained to composite&#x2010;genre units of verse, prose, and illustration. Had he fair&#x2010;copied 
                    <title type="essay" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title> in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>&#x2014;and that title does appear toward the end of the 
                    <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.xml">Proposed Table of Contents for the Account of a Tour on the Continent</ref>&#x2014;he 
                    presumably would have adhered to the fair copy&#x02BC;s pattern of leading the unit with a vignette&#x2010;style illustration followed by the section title, then fair&#x2010;copied the poem, 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY">&#x201C;I woke to hear the lullaby&#x201C;</title>, and finished with the prose essay.<lb/>
                    
                    <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> errs, then, not so much in the title he gives to <title type="poem" corresp="#JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY">&#x201C;I woke to hear the lullaby&#x201D;</title>&#x2014;for 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRARVEATCHAMOUNI">&#x201C;The Arve at Chamouni&#x201D;</title> is apt enough&#x2014;as in giving the poem any title at all. 
                    The most questionable decision lies in his separating the poems from the prose in the first place, to form a version of the 
                    <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> solely in verse&#x2014;a version that, 
                    if it ever conceptually existed at all, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> abandoned after composition of the first five poems about towns in northern <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName>.<lb/>
                    
                    <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> does use the title <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERONPOEM">"The Source of the Arveron"</title> (he adds the article), 
                    but assigns it to another poem, which is untitled in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft, 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEFOAMGLOBES">&#x201C;The foam globes round come riding fast&#x201D;</title>. This poem falls later in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    draft of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">"Account"</title> in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, amid draft of the prose section for &#x201C;<placeName corresp="#HEIDELBERG">Heidelberg</placeName>.&#x201D; 
                    Unlike <title type="poem" corresp="#JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY">&#x201C;I woke to hear the lullaby&#x201D;</title>, this poem identifies its subject explicitly as the <placeName corresp="#ARVERON">Arveyron</placeName>, 
                    and presents a more obvious complement topographically to the prose description of <title type="essay" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">"Source of the Arveron"</title>. 
                    Whereas <title type="poem" corresp="#JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY">"I woke to hear the lullaby"</title> or <title type="essay" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERONPOEM">&#x201C;The Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title> 
                    complements the mood of reverie in the essay, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEFOAMGLOBES">&#x201C;The foam globes round come riding fast&#x201D;</title> or 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERONPOEM">&#x201C;The Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title> (poem) complements the prose description of the glacier source of the stream.
                    
                    In the Library Edition, in which the editors reunite the poems with their complementary prose sections, 
                    <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> do recognize that the title, <title type="essay" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;The Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title>, 
                    should serve as a section title, which they apply to the prose essay as well as, taking <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x20BC;s cue, to the poem, 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEFOAMGLOBES">&#x201C;The foam globes round come riding fast&#x201D;</title> which <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> entitled 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERONPOEM">&#x201C;The Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</title>
