                    which encircled the interior of the building&#x02BC;s dome, but to the subordinate exhibits, which surrounded the building on its perimeter. By the time of the

                    had begun surrounding the structure with pleasure gardens, which contained a bewildering variety of attractions that were anything but unified in feeling, 
                    and among these <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> singled out these seemingly random objects.</p>
                    
                    <p>The crocodile stools are explained by an <date when="1829">1829</date> aquatint by the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann firm</orgName>,

                        The scene in the print opens out to a large fountain from inside a &#x201C;treillage pavilion&#x201D; designed in the manner of <persName corresp="#HR">Humphry Repton</persName>. 
                        This pavilion apparently was never built at the <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName>, but the aquatint includes a garden seat fancifully 
                        speared by a reptile, its head protruding from one end, its tail curling outward from the other end, and its legs forming the stool&#x02BC;s frame. With unconscious irony, 
                        the print&#x02BC;s caption highlights the heterogeneous mixing of styles and objects: the scene &#x201C;represents the south side of the grounds which surround the building, 
                        embracing a picturesque trait of the beautiful union of Greek Architecture, thus judiciously combining with plants and flowering shrubs. The view is taken from the 
                        Corridor or covered way, leading from the interior of the structure [the trellised pavilion] to the first Fountain, whose refreshing showers are felt delightfully cooling 
                        after the ascent to the Gallery of the <title type="artwork" corresp="#HORNORSLONDONPANORAMA">Panorama</title>, 
                        and the circuit of the Pavilion enriched with so great a treasury of art. This enchanting spot leads through delightful alleys formed by extensive greenhouses, 
                        abounding in all the richest productions of <name type="fictional_person" corresp="#FLORA">Flora</name>, from almost every region, to the <placeName type="building" corresp="#SWISSCOTTAGECOLOSSEUM">Swiss Farm&#x2010;House</placeName>, 
                        from the verandah of which will be viewed the Rocky Scene, with the stupendous Water&#x2010;falls, and other objects, characteristic of the romantic and picturesque region 
                        which it is intended to describe. This part of the great scheme, when completed, it is believed, will amount to an illusion, having been prepared 
                        with rare skill and at a vast expense&#x201D;. Thus, the print&#x02BC;s caption leads the viewer from the crocodile stools shown in the print&#x02BC;s foreground 
                        to the other miscellaneous object in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s farrago, the <placeName type="building" corresp="#SWISSCOTTAGECOLOSSEUM">Swiss Cottage</placeName>.

                        (The fountain, another assemblage of miscellaneous objects, was a &#x201C;veil of water&#x201D; thrown upward and around a &#x201C;sleeping undine&#x201D;, 
                        and then falling down onto shells, corals, and mosses, as a &#x201C;dial of shells&#x201D; revolved above&#x2014;the whole enclosed inside a glass dome topped with a flowery finial.) 
                        From this &#x201C;work indeed of matchless art&#x201D;, the print&#x02BC;s caption promises, &#x201C;the spectator will be led to the various splendid apartments&#x201D;

                        was &#x201C;wainscotted with coloured (knotted) wood, and carved in imitation of the ornamented dwelling of a Swiss family&#x201D;. An engraving features a carved fireplace

                        and was considered &#x201C;characteristic of the primitive enjoyments of the happy people from among whom this model was taken&#x201D;. The rustic furnishings shown in the engraving,

                    <p>The <placeName type="building" corresp="#SWISSCOTTAGECOLOSSEUM">Swiss Cottage</placeName> was designed by an architect, <persName corresp="#PFR">Peter Frederick Robinson</persName>

                        he provides floor plans and elevations, as well as full renderings in landscape settings, of a &#x201C;Swiss Cottage&#x201D; and a &#x201C;Swiss Farm House&#x201D;

                        he adapts the Swiss chalet style (as well as several other styles) to villa architecture. As <persName corresp="#JSACKERMAN">James Ackerman</persName> comments, 
                        <persName corresp="#PFR">Robinson</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;major contribution was his expansion of the canon of acceptable historical styles&#x201D; for villa and cottage designs. 
                        This eclecticism was an outgrowth of the shift in the aesthetics and sociology of the British villa&#x2014;from emulation of <persName corresp="#AP">Palladio</persName> by elites 
                        in the earlier eighteenth century, entailing the Platonic notion that architecture imitated nature conceptually, &#x201C;exemplifying the principles of harmony in the universe&#x201D;, 
                        to the revolution in taste for the picturesque, entailing a psychology of associationism and democratic individualism, allowing &#x201C;the designer to give his work 
                        whatever character he believed to be suited to his client, the nature of the setting, or the function of the building&#x201D;

                        The Rocky Scene, however, reflected the ups and downs of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName>&#x02BC;s fortunes over the years. 
                        After <persName corresp="#THP">Hornor</persName>&#x02BC;s bankruptcy and flight to <placeName corresp="#USA">America</placeName> (see

                        These plans failed to prosper, however, and the <placeName type="building" corresp="#SWISSCOTTAGECOLOSSEUM">Swiss Cottage</placeName> gained only a miserable eagle, 
                        the survivor of a shuttered menagerie. While the bird perched haplessly on the miniature scenery outside the windows, refreshments were sold on the inside 
                        by a Cockney in Swiss costume. Later, in <date when="1845">1845</date>, another entrepreneur oversaw a more successful re&#x2010;opening, for which the Swiss scenery 
                        was refreshed by a theater&#x2010;scenery painter named <persName corresp="#GDANSON">George Danson</persName> (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HYDECOLOSSEUM"><persName corresp="#RHYDE">Hyde</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HYDECOLOSSEUM"><hi rend="italic">The Regent&#x02BC;s Park Colosseum</hi></title></ref>, 42, 49, 52, 44).

                    the men by leading them to an eminence from which they could survey the plains of <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> below. Yet the descent threatened to become 
                    even more treacherous than the ascent, since wintry weather had rendered the barren ground slippery with snow and ice, which the pack animals made worse by trampling 
                    into a slurry. At this crisis, the army advanced by using a technology that, while crude, would have evoked a modern parallel for post&#x2010;Napoleonic readers,
