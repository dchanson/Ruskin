                    with the &#x201C;residence of the two Plinys, and the scene of the scientific researches of the elder <persName corresp="PLINYELDER">Pliny</persName>, the naturalist&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book for Travellers in Switzerland</hi></title></ref>, 225;

                    The <placeName type="building" corresp="#VILLAPLINIANA">Villa Pliniana</placeName> was built on the lakeshore in the sixteenth century around the supposed spring mentioned by the elder <persName corresp="#PLINYELDER">Pliny</persName> in the <title type="book" corresp="#PLINYNATURALISHISTORIA">Naturalis Historia</title>, 
                    and described at length by the younger <persName corresp="#PLINYYOUNGER">Pliny</persName> in a letter to <persName corresp="#LLSURA">Licinius Sura</persName> (<title type="book" corresp="#PLINYEPISTULAE">Epistulae</title>, bk. 4, letter 30): 
                    &#x201C;There is a spring which rises in the mountain, and running among the rocks is received into a little banqueting&#x2010;room, from whence, 
                    after being detained a short time, it falls into the <geogName corresp="#LARIANLAKE">Larian lake</geogName>&#x201D;. <persName corresp="#PLINYYOUNGER">Pliny</persName> relishes reclining by the fountain, drinking the cool water and watching the spring &#x201C;rise and fall 
                    by fixed and measured gradations&#x201D;. He goes on to speculate about the cause of the intermittent flow (<persName corresp="#PLINYYOUNGER">Pliny the Younger</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#PLINYLETTERS">Letters</title>, 1:353, 355).</p>
                    
                    <p><persName corresp="#PLINYYOUNGER">Pliny</persName>&#x02BC;s letter demonstrates engagement in the idealized pursuits of country villa life (see <persName corresp="#JSACKERMAN">Ackerman</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#ACKERMANVILLA">The Villa</title>, 37). 
                        In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, not only is the point of <persName corresp="#PLINYYOUNGER">Pliny</persName>&#x02BC;s refinement 
                        missed in the clich&#x00E9;s about the dead underfoot; the poem also perversely fails to look overhead at surroundings that impressed <persName corresp="#PBS">Percy Shelley</persName>. 
                        In <date when="1818">1818</date>, <persName corresp="#PBS">Shelley</persName> wrote to <persName corresp="#TLPEACOCK">Thomas Love Peacock</persName> about trying to procure the <placeName type="building" corresp="#VILLAPLINIANA">Villa Pliniana</placeName> for an extended stay on the lake. 
                        As published by <persName corresp="#MWS">Mary Shelley</persName> in <date when="1840">1840</date>, 
                        the letter described &#x201C;a magnificent palace, . . . .now half in ruins, 
                    . . . built upon terraces <hi rend="italic">raised from</hi> the bottom of the lake, together with its garden at the foot of a semicircular precipice, overshadowed by profound forests of chestnut. 
                        The scene from the colonnade is the most extraordinary, at once, and the most lovely that eye ever beheld. On one side is the mountain, and immediately over you are clusters of cyprus&#x2010;trees 
                    of an astonishing height, which seem to pierce the sky. Above you, from among the clouds, as it were, descends a waterfall of immense size, broken by the woody rocks into a thousand channels to the lake. 
                    On the other side is seen the blue extent of the lake and the mountains, speckled with sails and spires. The apartments of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#VILLAPLINIANA">Pliniana</placeName> are immensely large, but ill furnished and antique. 
                        The terraces, which overlook the lake, and conduct under the shade of such immense laurel&#x2010;trees as deserve the epithet of Pythian, are most delightful&#x201D;

                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> still clung to the characterization of <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> as &#x201C;glorious in its death&#x201D;
