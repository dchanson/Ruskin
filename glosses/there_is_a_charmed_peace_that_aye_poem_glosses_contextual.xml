                    The family viewed the falls before breakfast on the morning of <date when="1833-06-10">June 10</date>, the day after their Sabbath sighting of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> 
                    described in this poem. <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName> declared the view &#x201C;second only to the <geogName corresp="ALPS">Alps</geogName> in grandeur,&#x201D; 
                    mentioning that the family crossed to the opposite side of the river for a prospect, and that they also viewed the scene in a camera obscura 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48">Diary of <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName>, <date when="1833">1833</date></ref>, 37). 
                    <persName corresp="#JM">Smith</persName> notes that early morning, the time chosen by the Ruskins, was among the most advantageous, &#x201C;when the Iris floats 
                    within the spray&#x201D;; however, <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName>&#x02BC;s opinion that the vantage from the opposite side of the river was &#x201C;inferior&#x201D; 
                    is not shared by <persName corresp="#JM">Smith</persName> (if indeed they refer to the same vantage point). <persName corresp="#JM">Smith</persName> advises: 
                    &#x201C;The best mode of visiting the falls from <placeName corresp="#SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</placeName> is to hire a boat from thence . . . , 
                    and descend the river, which already forms a succession of rapids, by no means dangerous under the guidance of a boatman accustomed to the river. When the increased celerity 
                    of the current and the audible roar announce that the skiff is approaching the falls, the steersman makes for the <abbr>l.</abbr> <expan>[left]</expan> bank, and lands his passengers under 
                    the picturesque castle of <placeName type="building" corresp="#LAUFENCASTLE"><hi rend="italic">Lauffen</hi></placeName>, situated on a high rock overlooking the fall, within the Canton of Zurich. 
                    It is occupied and rented by an artist who speaks English, and charges 1 franc admission for each person. The advantage of approaching the fall on this side is, 
                    that nothing is seen of it until it is at once presented in its most magnificent point of view, from the little pavilion perched on the edge of the cliff immediately above it. 
                    Its appearance from the opposite side of the river is tame in comparison, and the first impression from thence, made by the finest cataract in Europe, 
                    will most probably prove disappointing&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book for Travellers in <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName></hi></title></ref>, 19).</p></note>

                    which was nearly setting and cast a pink shade on the snowy peaks; it is the grandest and most sublime sight I have ever seen, no picture, no panorama 
                    can give the least idea of these magnificent mountains. The beautiful landscape near us through which the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> winds with its richly cultivated fields and vineyards, 
                    formed a fine contrast with the snowy mountains in the distance&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT48">Diary of <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName></title>, <date when="1833">1833</date></ref>, 36).

                    <p>British guidebooks and travel accounts of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date> do not mention a view of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> from <placeName corresp="#SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</placeName>; 
                        the town is invariably associated mainly with the approach to the <geogName corresp="#RHINEFALLS">Rhine Falls</geogName>. Panoramic views of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> 
                        are instead associated with <placeName corresp="#ZURICH">Z&#x00FC;rich</placeName>, farther south. <persName corresp="#JM">John Murray III</persName>, for example, highlights these 
                        views in the same summer weather at sunset that captured the Ruskins:
                        &#x201C;[o]ne of the most pleasing features about <placeName corresp="#ZURICH">Zurich</placeName> is its promenades and points of view. The best of them is decidedly the

                        and distant <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>. . . . Nothing can be more delightful than the view at sunset from this point, extending over the smiling and populous shores of the beautiful lake 
                        to the distant peaks and glaciers of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> of <geogName corresp="#GLARUSALPS">Glarus</geogName>, <geogName corresp="#URIALPS">Uri</geogName>, and <geogName corresp="#SCHWYZERALPS">Schwytz</geogName>, tinged with the most delicate pink by the sinking rays&#x201D;

                    <p>The Nonconformist clergyman, <persName corresp="#TRAFFLES">Thomas Raffles</persName> (<date notBefore="1788" notAfter="1863">1788&#x2013;1863</date>), was moved to pious reflections, expressed using tropes similar to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s, 
                        when first viewing the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> from a height near <geogName corresp="#LADOLE">Dole</geogName> in the <geogName corresp="#JURA">Jura</geogName>: 
                        &#x201C;the carriage suddenly stopped, and the postilion cried out, <hi rend="italic">There&#x02BC;s <geogName corresp="#MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</geogName>! There are the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>!</hi> 
                        I started from a deep reverie into which I had fallen, and lifting up my eyes, beheld the whole chain of <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>, 
                        forming the line of the horizon, at the immense distance of one hundred and thirty miles, and yet distinctly seen 
                        with the naked eye. <geogName corresp="#MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</geogName> appeared towering above them all, and glittering in the sunbeams like a crystal lake. 
                        The emotions of my mind at that moment were unutterable. I had not power to speak&#x2014;my heart beat with increased rapidity within my bosom&#x2014;and 
                        now that the sublime and stupendous objects, upon which my imagination had dwelt so long and with so much ardour, 
                        were actually before me, I could scarcely realize the scene, or believe the vision true. And, indeed, there was something so unearthly 
                        in their appearance&#x2014;distance, and the splendours of a summer noon had so melted and softened them down&#x2014;that 
                        they looked like a singular combination of dark and brilliant clouds resting on the earth; while the suddenness and unexpectedness of their appearance, 
                        all contributed to heighten the effect, and give it more the air of enchantment than reality. You may smile, perhaps, that I should make so much of what 
                        some would deem a very little thing, and occupy so many lines in telling you where and when I first saw the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>. But if there are any scenes that interest me, 
                        next to the important discoveries of the sacred volume, they are the sublime and beautiful in nature&#x2014;such objects as surround me now, 
                        and such as are to feast my eyes and fill my heart, if life and health are spared, through the ensuing week. The man who does not kindle at these
                        displays of the Creator&#x02BC;s power&#x2014;that has no spirit stirring in his breast to harmonize and mingle with them, had better stay in cities, and study man! 
                        But I am happy sometimes to escape from <hi rend="italic">man</hi>, to study <hi rend="italic">nature</hi>&#x2014;and amidst her awful or her lovely scenes, to converse with God. I send you a sketch 
                        of the scenery to which I have now alluded. It was committed immediately to paper, while the outline was before me. It has the merit of correctness, 
                        therefore, though I am well aware it is destitute of every other:</p>

                    <p>Despite Ruskin's clue of identifying a specific peak, one must bear in mind that he composed this poem in retrospect; and Roger Cardinal believes "it is hard to be sure which actual mountains 
                        the young Ruskin saw [from Schaffhausen]. It is possible he was looking more to the south-east at the Alpstein [near Lake Constance] and Churfirsten ranges [both part of the Appenzell Alps], 
                        which would have caught the rosy light of the setting sun. Directly to the south lie the higher Central Alps [i.e., the Schwyzer and Glarus Alps], beyond the famous peak of the Rigi; 
                        further west lies the even loftier Jungfrau-M&#x00F6;nch-Eiger complex [the Bernese Alps]. However, Ruskin's ultimate peak, Mont Blanc, is located much further to the south-west 
                        and is invisible from Schaffhausen. It was two summers later, at the Col de la Faucille above Geneva, that Ruskin witnessed the magnificent chain of the westernmost Alps 
                        'as the confirming view of the first view of the Alps from Schaffhausen' which sealed his vision of 'the Holy Land of my future work and true home in this world'", 
                        as he characterized these sightings decades later in Praeterita

                        and see Ruskin, Works, 35:167). According to letter 34 of <title type="book" corresp="#JRFORS"><hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi></title>, dated <date when="1873-10">October 1873</date>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> later believed &#x201C;I first saw the <geogName corresp="#BERNESEALPS">Bernese Alps</geogName> from above <placeName corresp="#SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</placeName>&#x201D;

                        This perspective seems meant to graft a sighting of the western Alps, which rise above <geogName corresp="#LAKEGENEVA">Lake Geneva</geogName>, 
                        onto the sighting of the <geogName corresp="#MONTRIGI">Rigi</geogName> in the central Alps, which rises above <geogName corresp="#LAKELUCERNE">Lake Lucerne</geogName>--thus, 
                        anticipating the "confirming view" celebrated in Praeterita.</p>
                    
                    <p>Writing in 1834, Ruskin's memory of sighting the Rigi in particular from Schaffhausen may be accurate, although he may already have constructed the memory based on later experience during the tour. 
                        The ride up to highest peak of the massif, the <geogName corresp="#MONTRIGIKULM">Rigi Kulm</geogName>, was a popular tourist attraction,

                    The popularity of the excursion, according to <persName corresp="#JM">John Murray III</persName>, owed &#x201C;less to its height . . . than to its isolated situation&#x201D;.
