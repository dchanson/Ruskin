                    the plain may be what <persName corresp="#GBM">G. B. Maule</persName> terms &#x201C;the most <placeName corresp="#FLANDERS">Flemish</placeName> portion of the plain of <placeName corresp="#LOMBARDY">Lombardy</placeName>.

                    If Ruskin means the plain beyond this foreground to comprise a longer perspective, he probably refers to the expanse of both

                    By marking this horizon as "St Bernard's fastnesses", <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> means the pass of the Great St. Bernard between the valley of Aosta on the Italian side to Martigny in the valley of the Rh&#x00F4;ne on the Swiss side.</p></note><!--The pointer to this gloss would be <ref type="gloss" target="genoa_poem_glosses_contextual.php#STBERNARDGLOSS"/>.-->

                    travellers were well situated not only to glimpse the Alps to the northwest but also the Apennines to the south. Maule writes: "Beyond Novi, you begin to enter the Apennines, 
                    and the country becomes very beautiful. Fine hills in the distance, curiously stratified rocks nearer the road, and the most beautiful groves of chestnut, 
                    all cheer and enliven the way." Perhaps the "topmost mountain ridge" where Ruskin stood to "dream away" was near <placeName corresp="#PONTEDECIMO">Ponte Decimo</placeName>, 
                    where Maule says "the ridge of the Apennines is now crossed; and the scenery becomes finer and finer, until at length you gain a most extensive view of the <hi rend="italic">riviera</hi>, 
                    with Genoa and its bay beneath you, the vineyards, of which the trellices are supported by stone pillars, forming beautiful avenues.
