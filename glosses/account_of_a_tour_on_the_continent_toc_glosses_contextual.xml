Nonplussed by these modern urban public spaces, <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> and <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> 
                    responded enthusiastically to the Gothic cathedral, a preference that led early in the development of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNT">"Account"</title> to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>'s only completed poem about <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName>, 
                    <ref type="witness" target="milan_cathedral_poem_msia_g2.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRMILANCATHEDRAL">&#x201C;Milan Cathedral&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                    In that poem, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> emphasizes the vertical thrust of the carthedral, comparing its spires to <geogName corresp="#MONTEROSA">Monte Rosa</geogName> rising on the city's horizon, 
                    whereas he projected, but evidently neglected to draft, the poem or essay on the <placeName type="building" corresp="#PORTAVENEZIA">Corso</placeName>, which would have expressed some view of the horizontal axes and breadth of the <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Enlightenment city</placeName>.</p>
                    
                    <p>The modernization of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#PORTAVENEZIA">Corso di Porta Orientale</placeName> (also known as the <placeName corresp="#PORTAVENEZIA">Porta Venezia</placeName>) was begun in 1<date when="1827">1827</date> and completed in the year of the Ruskins' visit, <date when="1833">1833</date>. 
                        Designed by <persName corresp="#RVANTINI">Rodolfo Vantini</persName> (<date notBefore="1792" notAfter="1856">1792-1856</date>), the gateway is marked by a pair of cubical structures that, like the <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANDEBURGGATE">Brandeburg Gate</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#BERLIN">Berlin</placeName>, 
                        evoke the <placeName type="building" corresp="#PROPYLAEAATHENS">Propylaea of the Acropolis</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#ATHENS">Athens</placeName>. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, such structures heralded the entrance to the city as "work of art" 
                        (Etlin 2-4; and see Olsen). In <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName>, the planning for these neoclassical monuments began under the Enlightenment administration of the Hapsburgs, 
                        overseen by the architect, <persName corresp="#GPIERMARINI">Giuseppe Piermarini</persName> (<date notBefore="1734" notAfter="1808">1734-1808</date>). His most famous work, the <placeName type="building" corresp="#TEATROALLASCALA">Teatro alla Scala</placeName> (<date notBefore="1776" notAfter="1778">1776-78</date>), was visited by the Ruskins, 
                        although they were unable to attend a performance there, but <persName corresp="#GPIERMARINI">Piermarini</persName>'s plans for neoclassical renovation were apparent throughout the city. 
                        By the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830</date>s, however, the Hapsburg project had been overlain by <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>'s ambitions for the city, which appropriated the neoclassical design 
                        to promote republican and imperial ideals. This symbolism was often expressed using a columnar, Doric vocabulary associated with <placeName corresp="#PAESTUM">Paestum</placeName>. 
                        The Ruskins appear to have sought out these Napoleonic monuments, including a vast "amphitheatre", referring apparently to the <placeName corresp="#FOROBONAPARTE">Foro Bonaparte</placeName> (<date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1806">1801-6</date>), 
                        planned by <persName corresp="#GAANTOLINI">Giovanni Antonio Antolini</persName> (<date notBefore="1756" notAfter="1841">1756-1841</date>) as a spectacular entrance to the city from the Strada del Sempione, 
                        connecting to the Simplon Pass, which Napoleon's engineers had modernized as an accessible carriage road. The Foro Bonaparte was completed in altered form 
                        by Luigi Canonica (<date notBefore="1762" notAfter="1844">1762-1844</date>). At its entrance on the city side, the Ruskins also viewed the arch commemorating Napeoleon's victory at Marengo (now known as the Arco della Pace), 
                        designed by Luigi Cagnola (<date notBefore="1762" notAfter="1833">1762-1833</date>), begun in <date notBefore="1807">1807</date> and still incomplete when the Ruskins visited. On their last day in Milan, they viewed Cagnola's city gate built 
                        "in memory of [Napoleon's] victory at Marengo", today known as the Porta Ticinese (<date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1814">1801-14</date>) (Kirk 77-83, 91-98).</p></note>

                    In <date when="1833">1833</date>, the Certosa being still closed to religious orders, Mary Richardson says that the family visited the cells of former monks and noted their wealth, the Certosa being the "heir . . . and son of a hundred fathers"

                        is not older than the <date notBefore="1400" notAfter="1499">15th century</date>, but may possibly rest on Roman foundations. It unites the <placeName corresp="#CANTONVAUD">canton Vaud</placeName> 
                        with the <placeName corresp="#CANTONVALAIS">canton Vallais</placeName>; and a gate at one end, now removed, formerly served to close the passage up and down: 
                        a circumstance alluded to in the lines of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>. A small fort was erected by the Swiss in <date when="1832">1832</date>, above the road,
