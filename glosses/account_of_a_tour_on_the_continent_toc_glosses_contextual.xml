                    3 July, <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName> records that the family, after visiting <placeName corresp="#ARONA">Arona</placeName> on <geogName corresp="#LAKEMAGGIORE">Lake Maggiore</geogName>, crossed to <persName corresp="#VARESE">Varese</persName> and ascended the <geogName corresp="#MADONNADELMONTE">Madonna del Monte</geogName>. 
                    She notes the chapels situated along the ascent (incorrectly connecting them the stations of the cross) and the view from the summit, 
                    which she and <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> enjoyed from a steeple that they ascended accompanied by <persName corresp="#SALVADOR">Salvador</persName>

                    &#x201C;The chief object of attraction at <placeName corresp="#VARESE">Varese</placeName> is the celebrated <placeName type="building" corresp="#SANTUARIOOFTHEVIRGIN">Santuario of the Virgin</placeName>, caUed <geogName corresp="#MADONNADELMONTE">La Madonna del Monte</geogName>, 
                    which is situated on a lofty hill about five miles to the north&#x2010;west of the city. It is said to have been founded in 397 
                    by <persName corresp="#STAMBROSE">St. Ambrose</persName>, to commemorate a  great victory,&#x2014;not in argument, but in arms,&#x2014;gained by him on this spot over the Arians. 
                    The slaughter is said to have been so great that the heterodox party were exterminated. It was dedicated to the <persName type="scriptual_person" corresp="#VIRGINMARY">Virgin</persName>, and her statue, 
                    which was consecrated by <persName corresp="#STAMBROSE">St. Ambrose</persName>, is still preserved. At the end of the <date notBefore="1500" notAfter="1599">16th century</date> Agaggiari, a Capuchin monk, built, out of funds raised by his exertions, 
                    the fourteen chapels which stand by the side of the road which leads to the church on the summit. . . . The fourteen chapels represent the 
                    fourteen mysteries of the Rosary. . . . They contain coloured statues in stucco, . . . and frescoes . . . of the painters of the Milanese school of the <date notBefore="1500" notAfter="1599">16th century</date>. 
                    Over the fountain, near the last chapel, is a fine colossal statue of <persName type="scriptual_person" corresp="#MOSES">Moses</persName>. . . . Connected with the chureh is a convent of Augustinian nuns. . . . 
                    Those who are not tempted by the religions objects may be perhaps induced to visit the <placeName type="building" corresp="#SANTUARIOOFTHEVIRGIN">Santuario</placeName> by being told that the ascent affords the most magnificent views

                        which spans the rapid river with one bold arch, 70 ft. wide, leaning for support (appuyé) on the rt. side upon the <geogName corresp="#DENTDEMORCLES">Dent de Morcles</geogName> and on the l. upon the <geogName corresp="#DENTSDUMIDI">Dent de Midi</geogName>, 
                        whose bases are pushed so far forward as barely to leave room for the river. The <placeName corresp="#SAINTMAURICEBRIDGE">bridge</placeName>, erroneously attributed to the Romans, is not older than the <date notBefore="1401" notAfter="1500">15th century</date>, 
                        but may possibly rest on Roman foundations. It unites the <placeName corresp="#CANTONOFVAUD">canton Vaud</placeName> with the <placeName corresp="#CANTONOFVALAIS">canton Vallais</placeName>; and a gate at one end, now removed, formerly served to close the passage 
                        up and down: a circumstance alluded to in the lines of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>. A small fort was erected by the Swiss in <date when="1832">1832</date>, above the road, to defend the pass&#x201D;

                    <p>Proceeding in the opposite direction across the bridge, <persName corresp="#MURRAY">Murray</persName>&#x02BC;s traveler emphasizes an invidious distinction typically made by British Victorian tourists between Protestant and Catholic Swiss cantons: 
                        &#x201C;No one can cross the <placeName corresp="#SAINTMAURICEBRIDGE">bridge of St. Maurice</placeName> without being struck with the change in the condition of the inhabitants of the two cantons. The neatness and industry 
                        of the <orgName corresp="#VAUDOIS">Vaudois</orgName> are exchanged within the space of a few hundred yards for filth and beggary, equally apparent in the persons and habitations of the Vallaisans. 
                        Their physical condition is lamentable; no part of <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName> is afflicted to a greater extent with the maladies of go&#x00EE;tre and cretinism . . . , 
                        and the victims of them shock the traveller&#x02BC;s sight at every step&#x201D;
