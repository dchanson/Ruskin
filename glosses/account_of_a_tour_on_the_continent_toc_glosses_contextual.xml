                        of the <placeName corresp="#CANTONVAUD">Vaudois</placeName> are exchanged within the space of a few hundred yards for filth and beggary, equally apparent in the persons and habitations of the <placeName corresp="#CANTONVALAIS">Vallaisans</placeName>. 
                        Their physical condition is lamentable; no part of <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName> is afflicted to a greater extent with the maladies of go&#x00EE;tre and cretinism . . . ,
