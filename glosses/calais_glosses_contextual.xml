                    As a substitution, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> devised his own line, printing it in square brackets, as shown in the <date when="1891">1891</date> witness. 
                    The editors of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.html">Library Edition</ref> disagreed; and in 
                    the <date when="1903">1903</date> witness of &#x201C;Calais&#x201D; [poem], they restored <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s original line, 
                    arguing that &#x201C;the young author, as we have seen in the case of the <ref type="apparatus" target="iteriad_apparatus.html">&#x2018;Iteriad&#x2019;</ref>, 
                    was not always careful to get a true rhyme, and [that] the meaning [of the original line 2 of &#x2018;Calais&#x2019;] is clear enough&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 2: 341 n. 2).</p>
                    
                    <p>In hypothesizing a &#x201C;rough copy, now lost,&#x201D; <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> evidently meant a draft version preceding not only 
                    the MS IX fair&#x2010;copy witness of &#x201C;Calais&#x201D; [poem], 
                    but also the MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1, witness of &#x201C;Calais&#x201D; [poem]&#x2014;the 
                    earliest extant version, which is in the hand of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, and which shows interlinear corrections by his son. 
                    In the latter version, line 2 is identical to that in the fair&#x2010;copy version. 
                    That <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> was familiar with the 
                        MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1 version, 
                        and was referring to this manuscript as containing the &#x201C;original&#x201D; version of &#x201C;Calais&#x201D; [poem], 
                    is indicated by his having accepted lines 5&#x2013;6 as originally composed in that version, in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hand, 
                    and by his implicitly rejecting <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s revision of those lines in that same MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1 version.
                    The manuscript holding the MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1 version  
                        is presently the sole surviving manuscript source of lines 5&#x2013;6, 
                    which <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> preferred, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> having carried his own, not his father&#x02BC;s, version of these lines to the 
                        MS IX fair copy.</p>
                    
                    <p>In arriving at his published version of &#x201C;Calais&#x201D; [poem], <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> appears therefore 
                        to have based his editorial decisions on his own aesthetic judgment, 
                    since his choices overall are consistent neither with the &#x201C;original&#x201D; in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hand 
                        nor with the final version in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s, even substituting a line of his own invention where he dislikes both versions. 
                    The editors of the Library Edition, <persName corresp="#ETC">E. T. Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName>, 
                        seem somewhat more consistent 
                        in preferring <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s final, fair&#x2010;copy version, although their decisions are as eclectic and aesthetically driven as 
                        <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s in accepting the latter&#x02BC;s re&#x2010;punctuation of the poem in combination with some punctuation 
                        found in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s fair copy. 
                        <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="AW">Wedderburn</persName> clearly, too, had access to the witnesses 
                        &#x201C;in both the rough and in the fair copy,&#x201D; as they call them&#x2014;meaning, by the &#x201C;rough&#x201D; witness, 
                    what they called <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;father&#x02BC;s copy,&#x201D; 
                        which is the manuscript containing the <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1 version 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 2:341 n. 2).</p>
                    
                    <p>By <date when="1903">1903</date>, the manuscript containing the <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1 version must have been bound as part of

                        added to Collingwood&#x02BC;s list of manuscripts in &#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D;

                        This manuscript, at least, would have been included in what the editors identify among the contents of <ref type="apparatus" target="apparatus_msia.html">MS IA</ref>

                    (&#x201C;a little France, a miniature picture&#x201D;). Similarly, in her journal of the tour, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_mary_note.php"><persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName> (1815&#x2013;49)</ref>

                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</ref>, p. 1). Guidebooks and travel accounts of the period tended to take a more practical view, 
                    portraying the port city in terms of British travelers&#x02BC; complaints about difficulties in negotiating customs and finding lodging; see, for example, 
                    <hi rend="italic">Heath&#x02BC;s Picturesque Annual for <date when="1832">1832</date></hi>, which warns that, in <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName>, 
                    &#x201C;the communication between the strangers and natives is full of strife and wrangling or silent bitterness&#x201D;

                    Whereas <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s account turns the abrupt transition from English character to French, separated only by the <geogName corresp="#ENGLISHCHANNEL">Channel</geogName> crossing, into a topic for picturesque contrasts of scenery and costume, 
                    <persName corresp="#JM">John Murray III</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1836">1836</date> guidebook emphasizes the comforts of familiarity: <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName> &#x201C;is half Anglicised and our language is generally spoken&#x201D;

                    fixation on the picturesque feature of &#x201C;peculiarly french&#x201D; fishing boats, there is also perhaps a reflection of the most picturesque image in 
                    <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, the &#x201C;passage&#x2010;boat [that] swept gaily by, / Laden with peasant&#x2010;girls 
                    and fruits and flowers, / And many a chanticleer and partlet caged / For <placeName corresp="#VEVAY">Vevay</placeName>&#x02BC;s market&#x2010;place&#x2014;a motley group /

                    chose to depict in his vignette heading this introductory poem. Typically what is lacking from <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s influence on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, 
                    however, is the older poet&#x02BC;s crowded historical references. <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> uses the trope of the city gate to allude to the story in the

                    his master would inflict on him for his lack of restraint and discipline, the youth determines to exile himself from his native city. 
                    Following this evocation, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> reverses the trope to imagine youths entering <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>&#x02BC;s
